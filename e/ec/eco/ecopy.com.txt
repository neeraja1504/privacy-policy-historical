For country-specific privacy details, select a location below:
Nuance Communications, Inc. ("Nuance") is dedicated to making your online experience as interesting and enjoyable as possible. We truly appreciate your presence on our site and at all times understand that you are our guest and should be treated accordingly. To ensure this, we have listed the components of our Privacy Policy below.
Use of Personal Information
Nuance Communications, Inc. abided by the Privacy Principles of the Safe Harbor Program as administered by the USA Department of Commerce. Details of these principles may be found at: www.export.gov/SafeHarbor.
Any information you submit through Nuance's web sites will be held in the strictest confidence. In no way will your personal information ever be used without your consent. To ensure this, all forms on our web sites that send information to a database that may be used in the future, e.g. mailing lists, registration, etc., have check boxes where you specify whether or not you would like to receive information from us in the future. Forms used just to send email, post messages, etc., do not include the option, but will never be used to send information. Be assured that we do not sell our name and address lists. If you choose to receive information from us, each message will also include instructions on how to "unsubscribe" from future mailings should you wish to cancel.
The only information we automatically collect is that related to the use of our web site. This information is anonymous and is gathered through our servers' log files. These log files record generic information, such as the number of visits our web site receives, the types of browsers used and the number of files downloaded, but never personal information. This log file information allows us to create better content aimed at our viewer's preferences.
Nuance does not collect information that personally identifies individuals except when individuals provide such specific information on a voluntary basis. There may be occasions where specific personal information is requested before an individual can enter certain sections of Nuance's site or for participation in a certain program. For example, registration may be required to participate in an online forum or contest. This kind of registration helps us to ensure that content standards are rigorously upheld or that contact can be made with prize winners. In all such cases, Nuance will collect only information that is voluntarily provided by the user and undertakes that such information will be kept strictly confidential. Any such individual information provided to Nuance will not be sold or made available to a third party. Nuance does reserve the right, however, to perform statistical analyses from the information you provide so as to improve our products or to gather marketing information. Only aggregated data from these analyses, not individual data, will be used for this purpose.
Use of Data Collection
All products and all studies, reports, analyses and other data, information or materials created in whole or part using Data shall be and remain the sole property of Nuance. None of the Data will be returned to you. As its proprietary information, Nuance intends to keep the Data confidential. Furthermore, Nuance intends to use the Data for the purpose of developing and enhancing the Software, future versions of the Software and/or related or similar software ("the Purpose"). The voluntary policies that Nuance intends to follow to maintain the confidentiality of the Data include the following: (a) sharing the Data only with employees, agents, consultants, or officers of Nuance with a need to know to carry out the Purpose ("Authorized Persons"), and (b) requiring such Authorized Persons to enter into written confidentiality agreements with Nuance when, in Nuance's sole judgment, such written confidentiality agreements are necessary to safeguard the confidentiality of the Data. PLEASE NOTE, HOWEVER, that Nuance's handling or treatment of the Data in accordance with this Section 1 is entirely voluntary and, therefore, NUANCE WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PARTY FOR FAILURE TO KEEP THE DATA CONFIDENTIAL OR TO OTHERWISE HANDLE OR TREAT THE DATA IN ANY MANNER.
Use of Cookies
Some of our pages use a feature of your browser called a "cookie." Cookies, by themselves, are not able to extract any personal information from you. This cookie automatically identifies your computer - but not you - to our servers when you visit our site. Unless you specifically tell us, Nuance will never know who you are, even though we may assign your computer a cookie. Also, Nuance's web sites can only read cookies created by Nuance's web sites.
Cookies allow us to personalize our site for you and to provide you with information that fits your needs and desires. For instance, once you register your product online, a cookie is written to your computer so that you will not need to type information in the future to obtain support.
