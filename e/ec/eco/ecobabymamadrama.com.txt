Eco Baby Mama Drama: PR/Media/Privacy Policy
Thank you for your interest in working with me and being featured on my blog!  I am always open to trying any Eco-friendly products including but not limited to: cloth diapers, cloth wipes, cloth diapering accessories, mama cloth, reusable breast pads (if I am breastfeeding),  green cleaning products and other household items such as reusable bags and energy efficiency products.  If you have a product you would like to discuss with me to see if my blog is a fit for your company please contact me!
If you are interested in me doing a product review only , I request that you send me a full sized product for the review and allow for a 3 to 8 weeks turnaround time from when I receive the product until the review posting on my blog (unless otherwise agreed upon).  I reserve the right to refuse a review post if you send an item that is different than what was agreed upon.  Sample sizes are NOT allowed and if sent will not be reviewed, review items are requested to be at least $25 value.  I am not responsible for shipping costs and any items sent COD will be refused.
My reviews consist of my honest thoughts and opinions of product(s) along with action shots of the item(s) sent being used.  I will also include information on your/your company and links and pictures back to you.  Please be aware that any negative thought or areas of improvement will be posted with my positive thoughts.  Not every product is 100% positive for everyone, however if I have a negative experience or suggestion for improvement I will contact you for feedback.
If you would like to do a ** review and giveaway** , the review process as stated above is the same, the giveaway can be for either the same item(s) I reviewed, 1 or more item(s) if I reviewed several, store credit (gift certificate/card) to your business, or an item similar to one that I featured on my blog.  Please make sure you are specific on the giveaway item and the requirements for winnings.   Please specify if the giveaway is open worldwide, USA only or USA and Canada.  Unless otherwise agreed upon it is the sponsors (not EBMD blog) responsibility to ship the prize to the winner.  My winners are selected via Random.org and emailed by me and have 48 hours to respond (unless otherwise stated).  If no response is received another winner will be chosen via Random.org and notified.  When a winner responds to me with their shipping information I will them forward the information on to you.
