However, some special services such as forums and member content may require registration in order to allow full access to features.

From time to time, eCoustics may offer incentives to users in the form of contests, prizes, and giveaways, and request that users fill out surveys or questionnaires to qualify for participation in these special promotions. Unless explicitly indicated, information from these surveys, and questionnaires are used in group demographics studies and for better audience targeting – surveys and questionnaires related to contests may be subject to third party marketing companies. If you do not want your information subject to third party companies, do not fill out the contest surveys.

Privacy for Children – As per COPA
Although eCoustics generally targets to an adult audience, we welcome the visitation and participation of young users, with their parents’ consent. It is strongly recommended that users under the age of 13 refrain from disclosing any personal and/or private information either through the user registration system, or through participation in questionnaires and surveys, and instead opt to remain anonymous in their participation of site activities.
Please note that as of April 21st, 2000, the Child Online Protection Act of 1998 prohibits eCoustics from the collection of private information from users under the age of 13 without parental consent. Users under the age of 13 must provide a signed letter from their parents to indicate that they are aware of their child’s activities on eCoustics and consent to these activities. This letter must be mailed or faxed to eCoustics Corporation, using the contact information below, before they can participate in activities requesting the disclosure of private information.
Parents of our younger users may at any time, revoke their consent, and may request to review and edit the private information disclosed by sending a written request to eCoustics LCC via fax or mail.
Though eCoustics will take reasonable measures to ensure that users under the age of 13 do not disclose their private information without first obtaining parental consent, the site cannot guarantee the protection of young users who choose not to disclose their age and who do not follow the requirements set forth by COPA.
