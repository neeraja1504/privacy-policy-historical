Economics Online Data Protection Policy (with effect from May 25th 2018)
ECONOMICS ONLINE – DATA PROTECTION POLICY
1.  Scope of this policy
Our privacy policy is intended to explain and clarify how we meet our own expectations
regarding the privacy of visitors to our website, as well as meet the requirements of the
new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which comes into effect in UK and EU law on
Friday 25 May 2018.
2.  Privacy notice
2.1 Who are we and what do we do?
i) Economics Online is an information provider aimed at students of economics at Sixth
Form and High School, undergraduates, and those studying on professional courses,
including accounting and business courses. We have been doing this since 2008.
ii) We take data protection very seriously and understand the importance of protecting
your privacy and personal information. The personal data we might collect from you
is strictly limited in scope and is only collected if you make a purchase. Simply visiting
the site does not require you to provide any personal information. Personal
information is information that identifies you as an individual such as your name,
date of birth, email address, IP address and telephone number.
iii) Our website is hosted by Go Daddy in the USA and you can read their privacy policy
here.
iv) Unlike some ‘social media’ companies access to the material on Economics Online
does not require registration, and there is no registration process and hence no
personal information is obtained from you by us before you use the site, and while
you use the site. The information is provided freely to you and all you need to do is
visit the site. We do not collect personal information because we do not use personal
information other than to honor contracts with you (see below).
v)   If you go beyond the freely available information and choose to purchase any
materials from our store, which is operated by our third-party supplier – Shopify –
then essential data is collected in order to ensure that the purchase is made
successfully and the contract to supply is honored.
vi) Shopify (referred to below more generally as ‘store provider’) is based in the USA, and
you can view their privacy policy here.
vii) The personal data collected by Shopify is the minimum necessary to ensure that an
order placed with us can be fulfilled, and this includes your name, email address to
send a confirming message that your order is successful, your address, if a physical
shipment is made, and your telephone number if you choose to provide it. This
information is only used to facilitate a specific single transaction and is not used for
any marketing purpose nor is it used by us in any other way other than to enable a
transaction to be fulfilled. Personal data collected is used solely to enable our store
provider to fulfil an order that you have placed, and hence complete the legal
contract to supply you with purchased material. Economics Online may use this data
only for the purpose of supplying material you have ordered. For example, if a

transaction is ‘unsuccessful’ due to an input error we may contact you just to remind
you that you still have an item in your basket. While we are confident that our third-
party store provider, Shopify, also only collects data to facilitate specific transactions
our strong advice is to read their privacy policy to clarify for yourself how they might
use your data. (See iv above).
viii) There are numerous links on our website to organisations including the Bank of
England, the ONS, the UK Treasury, the WTO, the OECD and many national and
international newspapers, to name a few. These organisations will have their own
privacy policy and, should they request you to register with them, we strongly advise
you to consult their privacy policy.
ix) We have a Facebook page and Twitter page and you are advised to check their data
protection policies if you have any concerns about how your personal data may be
used. Facebook’s data policy can be viewed here, and Twitter’s data policy can be
viewed here.
x) In order to provide our information service free of charge, we accept advertisements
on our pages and these are supplied by Google. We strictly control the type of
advertisement we show. If you have concerns regarding how your data might be
used please consult Google’s Adsense policy notice, which can be viewed here. In
summary, their policy states that:
Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a user's
previous visits to a website and other websites.
Google's use of advertising cookies enables it and its partners to serve relevant ads
to you based on your visit to our site and/or other sites on the Internet.
You may opt out of personalised advertising by visiting Ads Settings. (Or you can opt
out of a third-party vendor's use of cookies for personalised advertising by
visiting www.aboutads.info.)
2.2 Consent
i) If you order material through our third-party store provider it is necessary for you to
provide them with information to enable your order to be fulfilled, and this data will
be held to enable the order to be fulfilled. Even though we do not use data for any
marketing purpose or supply your data to third parties, as part of the order process
you will now be informed about this, and given the opportunity to withdraw future
consent once the order has been fulfilled.
ii) You may withdraw consent at any time after the end of the retention period (see
below) by emailing us at admin@economicsonline.co.uk stating that you ‘do not want
Economics Online to hold my personal data’. Data will be removed within 12 hours of
this request.

Economics Online Data Protection Policy (with effect from May 25th 2018)
2.3 Disclosure
Economics Online gathers no personal data from you directly and hence will not pass on
your personal data to third parties. The following third party will receive your personal
data for the purpose of fulfilling an order placed by you as part of their processing
activities:
Shopify Store
2.4 Retention period
i) Economics Online has access to personal data held by our store provider for the
purpose of fulfilling an order placed through them – while digital downloads are
stored on their database there are, from time to time, situations when a download
has not occurred, or where the link to the material has expired, and in this case,
Economics Online may fulfil this order directly, but the payment process will be
managed securely by Shopify and we have no access to financial information.
ii) To enable us to provide back-up or replacement materials we do keep records of the
initial transaction including the product ordered, the purchaser’s name, postal
address and email address. In the interests of being able to keep in contact with a
purchaser we keep this basic data on our database for a twelve-month period unless
otherwise instructed by the purchaser or a nominated representative, as indicated
above. We should be instructed through the original email address you initially used
to make the purchase.
2.5 Your rights as a data subject
While we do not collect or store personal information when you visit Economics Online nor
do we use your data other than to fulfil a specific order if you make a purchase of material
through our third-party store, we are obliged to inform you of your rights as a ‘data
subject’, which are:
• Right of access – you have the right to request a copy of the information that we
hold about you.
• Right of rectification – you have a right to correct data that we hold about you that
is inaccurate or incomplete.
• Right to be forgotten – in certain circumstances you can ask for the data we hold
about you to be erased from our records.
• Right to restriction of processing – where certain conditions apply to have a right to
restrict the processing.
• Right of portability – you have the right to have the data we hold about you
transferred to another organisation.
• Right to object – you have the right to object to certain types of processing such as
direct marketing.
• Right to object to automated processing, including profiling – you also have the
right to be subject to the legal effects of automated processing or profiling.
•    Right to judicial review: in the event that Economic Online refuses your request
under rights of access, we will provide you with a reason as to why. You have the
right to complain as outlined in clause 2.6 below.
All of the above requests will be forwarded on should there be a third party involved (as
stated in 2.3 above) in the processing of your personal data.
