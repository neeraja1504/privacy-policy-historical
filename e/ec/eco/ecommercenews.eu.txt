Explanation: what do we do with your data?
We prefer not to share any data of yours with third parties, so we can guarantee your privacy. Unfortunately, that’s not possible for a site like this (according to us). To convince advertisers we must be able to show that we have visitors and sometimes show a certain visitors profile. That’s why sometimes we share totals from Google Analytics with advertisers, but it will always nothing more than these kinds of anonymous data.
We don’t use cookies or other tracking techniques ourselves in order to personalize content or advertisements. The ads are focused on the content, which means they should fit in with your profile, but we have any stats or facts about this. However, we use third party technology on this site, which can collect data from these tools.
What do third parties do with your data?
On this website, we actively use third-party solutions. This means it can’t be ruled out that these parties, such as Google, may also have access to certain data. But again, we try to limit the use of cookies to a minimum. For example, within AdSense and Analytics, we exclude the following of cookies (retargeting). However, these partners may be able to combine data with information that you have provided to them, through other websites/services or which they have collected based on your use of their services.
