Privacy Policy
Neither the Library of Economics and Liberty, EconTalk, EconLog, nor their owner, Liberty Fund, Inc., gather information about you that is tied to your name or email address unless you specifically request it. Information tied to your name or email address is not used for anything other than to contact you for matters directly related to your request. We do not sell our mailing lists or use them to send mass mailings other than those for which you have explicitly selected. Neither do we correlate information across the various sources.
Examples of when you specifically request us to store information about you are

Some of our mailing lists are maintained by reliable outside firms. If you register for any of these mailing lists, you are explicitly informed as part of the registration process. We try to select outside firms that have privacy policies as strong as our own, but we cannot guarantee the behavior of non-Econlib companies.
We use Google Analytics to help us understand how our customers use the site. Data retention for our analytics accounts are set to retain information for 14 months.
