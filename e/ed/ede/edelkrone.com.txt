LUCKY ORANGE WEB ANALYTICS SERVICE
This site uses the Lucky Orange analytics system to help improve usability and the customer experience. Lucky Orange may record mouse clicks, mouse movements and scrolling activity. Lucky Orange may record keystroke information that you voluntarily enter on this website. Lucky Orange does not track this activity on any site that does not use the Lucky Orange system. You can choose to disable the Lucky Orange Service here. Please note, however, that doing so will disable other features of the Lucky Orange system that this site employs such as 1-to-1 support chat.

HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION?
We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you place an order or enter, submit, or access your personal information.
We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then stored in the “Vault” on Braintree (a PayPal company) servers. The Vault securely stores customer information, including payment methods. When a payment method is stored in the Vault, the information is encrypted by the Braintree gateway.
While we make every effort to ensure that your information is secure, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do this at your own risk.

DO WE USE COOKIES?
Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site’s or service provider’s systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information.
We use cookies to help us remember and process the items in your shopping cart, understand and save your preferences for future visits, keep track of advertisements and compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future. Some of our business partners may use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies.
If you prefer, you can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies via your browser settings. Like most websites, if you turn your cookies off, some of our services may not function properly. However, you can still place orders over the telephone or by contacting customer service.

DO WE DISCLOSE ANY INFORMATION TO OUTSIDE PARTIES?
Other than as expressly provided for herein, we do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also include your information in connection with the sale of edelkrone or substantially all of its assets, and we may release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, cooperate with government officials in any investigation relating to any content (including personal or private electronic communications transmitted to edelkrone) or purported unlawful activities of any user, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others' rights, property, or safety. However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.
