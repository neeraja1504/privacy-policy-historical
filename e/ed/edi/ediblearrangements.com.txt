A cookie, also known as an HTTP cookie, web cookie, or browser cookie, is a small piece of data sent from a Edible Sites and stored in a user's web browser while the user is browsing that Edible Sites (“Cookie”). Every time the user loads the Edible Sites, the browser sends the Cookie back to the server to notify the Edible Sites of the user's previous activity. Web beacons (also known as image tags, gif or web bugs) are small pieces of code used to collect advertising data, such as counting page views, promotion views or advertising responses (“Web beacons”).

Some of these Tracking Technologies may be placed by third party service providers to help determine the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns or email communications. These Tracking Technologies may be used by these service providers to place a persistent Cookie on your computer.

This Policy does not cover any use of information that a third party service provider may directly collect from you and we do not undertake to confirm, investigate, or police their practices.
We use Tracking Technologies, web server log files and tracking code, and information we receive through the use of these Tracking Technologies to analyze trends, administer this Edible Sites, track users’ movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. Information of this type may be combined with other sources of information for these purposes. Specifically, through the use of web server log files and tracking code any or all of the following information may be accessed, collected, analyzed and stored during or after your visits to our Edible Sites: the name of the domain from which you access the Internet; the date and time you access our Edible Sites; the pages that you visit on our Edible Sites and the sequence in which you visit them; the amount of time that you spend on any given page of our Edible Sites; the Internet address of a website that you visited immediately before visiting our Edible Sites; the Internet address of a website from which you linked directly to our Edible Sites, if any; the Internet address of a website that you visit immediately after leaving our Edible Sites; the type of operating system on your computer; and the type of browser that you are using to view a Edible Sites.
