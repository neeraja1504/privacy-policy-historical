initiative by Eduvative Technologies LLP. EdTechReview India respects your privacy
and recognizes your need for appropriate protection and management of your personal
information, such as your name and email address.
Please read this Privacy Policy carefully, and know how your personal information is
collected and used by us. Contact us with any questions you may have by emailing

WHO CAN USE?
Anyone can view our Web site, but a free account and/or subscription is required for
access to the full range of information and online services.
WHAT INFORMATION DOES EDTECHREVIEW INDIA COLLECT AND
HOW?
Personal information collected by EdTechReview India is information voluntarily
provided to us by you when you subscribe to our newsletter or contact us with a query or
by creating an account on the site. Currently, information that we save about you
includes your email address and, optionally, your first and last name and any other
information voluntarily provided. This information is maintained on secure third-party
servers. You may unsubscribe from our email distribution lists via a link at the bottom
of every newsletter, which removes your information from our mailing system system
and the third-party systems we utilize. Even after unsubscribing, we will keep your
details for records but would not use them for the usual operations.
In case of premium reports and case studies, even if offered by us as “free”, we may also
ask for your physical mailing address, organization, name, email and phone number.
You will be notified of possible disclosure to third party sponsors at the time you request
a report, prior to confirming your order. Sponsors may use your mailing address to
contact you regarding offers that they feel may be of interest to you. We have no control
over the use a Sponsor may make of your contact information.
If you chose to make a comment on our site, your user name or profile picture or both
may appear alongside your comment. Comments are stored on our secure third-party
server. Additionally, the EdTechReview India website uses "cookies" to track and collect
information about you and your visit to our site, such as IP address, browser, operating
system, time of visit, etc. A cookie is a small string of text that a website can send to your
browser, for the purpose of enhancing our understanding of site user activity and your
visit to the website. A cookie cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive, pass

to alert you when a cookie is being placed. You may also clear all cookies saved to your
computer by using the relevant selection in your internet browser. We use cookie
information to understand from where in the world our site traffic comes. Based upon
the information collected by cookies, we may also suggest posts or show ads that we
think will be of interest to you.
