Overseas Disclosure of Personal Information
As a global organisation, we may store, use, transfer, and otherwise process your personal information in countries outside of the country of your residence. By using our Services, you consent to Edrolo’s transfer to and handling of your personal information in a jurisdiction which may have different (and less stringent) data protection rules than the country in which you reside.
Edrolo stores customer data in the cloud (it would be basically impossible to deliver our resources to students and teachers without doing so).

Our databases (containing Name, Contact Details and Subject Enrolments) are stored with Amazon Web Services (AWS) in the Asia Pacific Region (Sydney). Schools can take confidence from our deliberate choice of reliable, high-quality providers, like AWS, who set the industry standards for information security, and operate under the strongest compliance standards and industry certifications. It is of paramount importance to both AWS and us that your data is private and secure. If you have further questions regarding AWS standards and protocols, AWS house a comprehensive set of compliance resources on their website which can be accessed here.
Marketing
Where we use your personal information to send you marketing and promotional information, you will be provided with an opportunity to opt-out of receiving such information. Unless you exercise your right to opt-out of such communication, you will be taken to have consented to the receipt of similar information and communications in the future.

Accessing Your Personal Information
You may request that we provide you with access to the personal information we hold about you by contacting us using the contact details provided at the end of this Privacy Policy. However, privacy and data legislation in your jurisdiction may set out certain circumstances where we may deny, or only partially comply with such a request. These circumstances may include, for example, where:
access would pose a serious threat to the life, safety or health of any individual or to public health or public safety;
access would have an unreasonable impact on the privacy of other individuals;
the request is frivolous or vexatious;
denying access is required or authorised by a law or a court or tribunal order;
access would be unlawful; or
access may prejudice commercial negotiations, legal proceedings, enforcement activities or appropriate action being taken in respect of a suspected unlawful activity or serious misconduct.
If you require access to any information we hold about you, we request that you identify, as clearly as possible, the type of information requested. We will respond to your request to provide access to your personal information within a reasonable period after the request is made, and you agree we may charge you our reasonable costs incurred in supplying you with this information as permitted under the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth).
Updating Your Personal Information
We take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances to ensure that:
the personal information we collect and store, is accurate, up to date and complete; and
the personal information we use and disclose is accurate, up to date, complete and relevant.
If you believe that information we hold about you may not be up to date, complete and accurate, you may notify us by contacting us using the contact details below.
You accept that we will take reasonable steps to verify your identity if you contact us with such a request.
Anonymity and Pseudonymity
If you are making a general enquiry only, you may deal with us on an anonymous basis or through the use of a pseudonym. However, we will not be able to provide you with any specific information about your account if you fail to identify yourself to us.
Third-Party Links
Our Website, products, and services may include links to other websites whose privacy practices may differ from ours. If you provide your personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy policies.
