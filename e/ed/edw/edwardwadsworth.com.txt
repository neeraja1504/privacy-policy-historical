What Personal Information Do We Collect?
One of the basic principles we've followed in designing this Web site is that we ask for only the information we need to provide the service you've requested. As a result, the answer to this question depends almost entirely on how you choose to make use of our Web site and our growing list of Web site services.
Edward Wadsworth For Hair collects personal information only during (i) online shopping (ii) when client questionnaires are filled out (iii) when questions are submitted on the answer page.  Edward Wadsworth For Hair may use such information to fulfill purchase orders, track compliance with the site's rules and regulations or for editorial and feedback purposes (to the extent that is explained when users provide the information).  In the event Edward Wadsworth For Hair **** plans to publicly post any such information on a site, [users are provided prior notification of such posting and given the option of preventing such posting and only the user's first name is used.] Specifically requesting it from you collects personal information. Generally this occurs when you register at a site, request a service, or purchase products.
In addition to the use of personal information to operate Edward Wadsworth For Hair sites, an Edward Wadsworth For Hair site may also gather anonymous information, which may be used by Edward Wadsworth For Hair [or shared with third parties.] **** This collective data helps us determine how our customers use parts of the site, so we can improve our site and ensure that it is as appealing as we can make it for as many of you as possible.  We also may provide statistical "ratings" information, but never information about you personally, to our Edward Wadsworth For Hair partners about how our members, collectively, use Edward Wadsworth For Hair.  We do this so they too can understand how people use their areas of our site in order for them to provide you with the best possible experience as well. This information is also used to generate advertising rates. Generally this information is collected through "traffic data" and may entail the use of "Cookies" "IP addresses" or other numeric codes used to identify a computer.
Information We Ask About You __
Sometimes, we may specifically ask for information about you when you sign up to use a service or when you order a product. We will need certain information -- such as name, Internet address or screen name, billing address, type of computer, credit card number -- in order to provide that service or product to you. We may also use that information to let you know of additional products and services about which you might be interested.  [You can choose not to receive such information if you don't want to by letting us know on the registration screen when you sign up for the product or service.]  We also may ask you for information about your interests so that both you and we can take advantage of the interactivity of the Internet, but you may always choose whether to respond or not.
Use of Cookies
What about "Cookies"?
"Cookies" are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. "Cookies" make Web-surfing easier for you by saving your passwords, purchases, and preferences while you're at our site.  The use of "Cookies" is standard in the Internet industry, and many major Web sites use them to provide useful features for their customers.  By showing how and when guests use the site, "Cookies" help us see which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the site are based on such data as total number of visitors and pages viewed. This information is most easily tracked with "Cookies." "Cookies" in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user's computer.  Most Internet browsers are initially set to accept "Cookies."  If you prefer, you can set yours to refuse "Cookies" or to alert you when "Cookies" are being sent.  However, it is possible that some areas of the site, such as the shopping, contest, and game areas, will not function properly if you do so.
[How We Do Not Use Cookies
Our site never uses "Cookies" to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent in a cookie. Except as described above, we do not use information transferred through "Cookies" for any promotional or marketing purposes, nor is that information shared with any third parties whatsoever.  We do not use Cookies" to identify specific individuals, except in such cases as online shopping and contest registration (where a "Cookie" allows you to enter a contest every day without registering again each time). You may occasionally get "Cookies" from our advertisers. We do not control these "Cookies," and these "Cookies" are not subject to our "Cookie" policy.  The use of advertising "Cookies" sent by third-party servers is standard in the Internet industry. ****
How We Use the Information
We do not use or disclose information about your individual visits to our site or information that you may give us, such as your name, address, email address or telephone number, to any outside companies. We may, however, share with our Web site partners aggregated statistical "ratings" information about the use of our site. [Edward Wadsworth For Hair sites also use personal information to allow other companies to contact you regarding products and services that may be of interest to you (Secondary Uses). If an Edward Wadsworth For Hair site proposes to use personal information for Secondary Uses, you will be provided an opportunity to instruct the Edward Wadsworth For Hair site not to allow such contact.] Edward Wadsworth For Hair does not sell any customer lists or e-mail addresses.  However, we may partner with businesses to provide special services to our customers. This type of use of personal information is called a Secondary Use because it is not necessary to the operation of the business or site. For example, a site may offer discount coupons for services or related products. In many cases these discounts would be an added benefit to you.  If an Edward Wadsworth For Hair site proposes to make a Secondary Use of your personal information you will be given an opportunity to instruct the Edward Wadsworth For Hair site not to allow such contact.  You may contact us at any time in order to direct us to remove your information from future mailings.

Please keep in mind that whenever you give out personal information online - for example, via message boards or chat - that information can be collected and used by people you don't know.  While Edward Wadsworth For Hair strives to protect your personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online and you do so at your own risk. Finally, please note that this policy applies only to Edward Wadsworth For Hair and Web sites that carry the Edward Wadsworth For Hair brand, and not to other companies' or organizations' Web sites to which we link.
