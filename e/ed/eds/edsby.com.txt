CoreFour Inc.’s Privacy Policy for Edsby
Date of last revision of this policy: September 1st, 2017
Edsby (the “Site”) is a website that is owned and operated by CoreFour Inc (the “Company”) . The company is committed to protecting the privacy of our visitors while they interact with the content, products and services on Edsby. This Privacy Policy applies to the Site only. It does not apply to other websites to which we link. Because we gather and store certain types of information about our users, we want you to understand what information we collect about you, how we collect it, how that information is used, and how you can control our disclosure of it. You agree that your use of Edsby signifies your assent to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not use Edsby.
For the purposes of this document the term “ Parents ” will be used to refer to the parents, guardians, and others such as aunts, uncles, step-parents, grandparents that are specifically approved by someone legally responsible for a child to have access to information in Edsby regarding that child.
Edsby provides a suite of services to the stakeholders of education organizations including teachers, students, administrators and Parents. Edsby is delivered as a “cloud service”, which means the data that Edsby stores and the servers that provide the Edsby service reside in a commercially run cloud hosting data centre that is designed to provide very high levels of security and reliability.
1) Information We Collect and Store
We collect and store three kinds of information on your behalf: i) your personal information, ii) content you provide, and iii) information related to your usage of the Site
Your Personal Information.
Our Site has the ability to store personal information such as your name, userid, password, address, telephone numbers, and email addresses. Most or all of this information is provided by your education organization when your account is created. It is updated from time to time by your education organization as it changes. Parents, Teachers and Administrators may have the ability to enter/modify/update some of the above information directly; that is at the discretion of your education organization. Students are never allowed enter/modify/update their own personal information directly.
Content You Provide.
Edsby enables you to provide a wide range of digital content including text, images, audio, video, files and web links. This digital content can be placed in messages, profiles, private notes, calendar events, gradebooks, and postings in shared places. Edsby stores this information on your behalf and tracks the fact that you provided that information. Note that files that you upload into the Site may have metadata associated with them. This metadata is preserved by the Site and will be available to anyone that has the ability to view or download the file you have uploaded.
Edsby has the ability to integrate with other computer systems that are used by the education organization you are part of. Examples of such computer systems include Microsoft Office 365 and Google G Suite. When Edsby integrates with these systems it provides a way for you to log in to Edsby by using your Microsoft or Google authentication credentials. In addition Edsby provides a convenient way for you to select files you have stored in the Microsoft and Google offerings and share either a link to that file or a copy of that file in Edsby. If you choose to share a copy of the file within Edsby then the Edsby software will make a copy of the file and store it on the Edsby server where it is subject to the permissions and access control settings of Edsby. An example of a typical example where this would happen is when a student writes an essay in Office 365 or Google Docs and selects that file through Edsby and submits it to their teacher. Edsby will make a copy of the selected file and make it available to the teacher via the Edsby gradebook software.
