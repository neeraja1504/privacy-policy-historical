Privacy Policy | EdgeCast
We are committed to protecting the privacy of our customers. We will never distribute, sell, or rent names, email addresses, or any other personally identifiable information to any third party.
The Details
EdgeCast sometimes shares non-personal, non-individual information in aggregate for our own research, development, and marketing purposes. For example, we will not - without that customer's express permission - provide specifics about who purchased or uses a specific product or service, but we might tell others how many customers purchased that product or service.
Customer profile information (e.g. name, title, address, services purchased) might be used by us to create personalized content, offers, services, and advertising, but only if they will be used and controlled by EdgeCast.
Third Party Content
Our web sites may contain content from third-party content providers; however, we will not provide user or customer information to the content provider(s).
Cookies
EdgeCast and/or third parties may use cookies to compile statistical data in order to help us analyze and understand how visitors interact with our site. The process may involve setting cookies on local systems in order to gather the necessary information to perform the statistical analysis. The information collected is designed to measure the performance of various marketing initiatives and overall website performance. This information can include the referring web page, as well as activity on our site and any information submitted.
Log Files
EdgeCast uses IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user movement, and to gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. The IP addresses collected are never linked to personally identifiable information unless a user specifically provides us that information during a session, such as by completing an inquiry form.
Surveys
We may occasionally request information from users via surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary. Information requested may include contact and demographic information. Survey data may be used to monitor or improve the use and satisfaction of our web site, products, or services. EdgeCast will retain ownership to all data provided via these surveys.
External Sites
The EdgeCast web site contains links to other sites. Those sites are not under our control; therefore, we make no representations as to the accuracy or integrity of their content. When you access a non-EdgeCast web site, you do so at your own risk, and our inclusion of such links does not imply that we endorse or accept any responsibility for their content or use. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of those web sites as well, because this privacy statement applies solely to our own site.
Opt-Out Policy
Please email privacy@edgecast.com if you no longer wish to receive information from us.
Changes to this statement
We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement. If we do, it will be updated on this web page.
Additional Information
While our web site may be accessed from countries around the world and contains references to EdgeCast products, services, and programs, such references do not obligate us to provide such products, services, or programs in every country.
If you have any questions or feedback about this privacy statement or any other practices of our site, please email us at: privacy@edgecast.com.
Thank you for your interest in our company and our codes of conduct.
