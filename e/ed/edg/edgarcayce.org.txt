Edgar Cayce’s Association for Research and Enlightenment (A.R.E.) believes in protecting the integrity and privacy of personal information gathered from our members and from visitors to our websites. Because protecting your privacy is of great importance to us, we have created this privacy policy to communicate our practices regarding the collection and dissemination of personal information that can be linked to a specific individual, such as a name, address, phone number, email address, or any other information provided to us by our members and by visitors to our websites.

Website
We collect the aggregate information on what pages consumers access or visit, user-specific information on what pages consumers access or visit, and other information volunteered by the consumer, such as survey information and/or site registrations. The information we collect is used to improve the content of our website and web pages, to customize the content and/or layout of our page(s) for each individual visitor, and/or to notify consumers about updates to our website.

Cookies
What is a Cookie?
A cookie is a small piece of data that is stored on a visitor’s hard drive but does not contain any personal information itself. Cookies enhance a visitor’s experience by preventing the visitor from having to login or provide information each time he or she revisits our EdgarCayce.org website and by customizing content based on a visitor’s interests.
We use cookies to store visitors’ preferences, record session information (such as items that consumers add to their shopping cart), record user-specific information on what page(s) users access or visit, alert visitors to new areas that we think might be of interest to them when they return to our website, record past activity at our site in order to provide better service when visitors return to our site, and customize web page content based on visitors' browser type or other information that the visitor sends.
Security
A.R.E. is extremely protective of the information gathered through its membership and websites. Our websites have security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of the information under our control. Our Web server is located in a locked, secure environment. When you contribute to A.R.E. online, register for an event, or make a purchase through the A.R.E. Catalog, we use a secure server and encryption to protect your financial and other personal information during transmission.
Member/Donor Privacy Policy
The A.R.E. does not sell, trade, or share a member/donor's personal information with anyone else, nor do we send donor mailings on behalf of other organizations.
