Privacy Policy | Cognitive Truths
Cognitive Truths (" Cognitive Truths ") operates CognitiveTruths.com and may operate other websites. It is Cognitive Truths policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.
Website Visitors
Like most website operators, Cognitive Truths collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Cognitive Truths purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Cognitive Truths visitors use its website. From time to time, Cognitive Truths may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
Cognitive Truths also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on CognitiveTruths.com blogs/sites. Cognitive Truths only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog/site where the comment was left.
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to Cognitive Truths websites choose to interact with Cognitive Truths in ways that require Cognitive Truths to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Cognitive Truths gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up at CognitiveTruths.com to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Cognitive Truths are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Cognitive Truths collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Cognitive Truths. Cognitive Truths does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Cognitive Truths websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Cognitive Truths will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Cognitive Truths discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Cognitive Truths believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Cognitive Truths, third parties or the public at large.
