What information does Eddie Bauer collect about me?
We may collect different kinds of information from or about you:
Information you provide:  When you purchase from Eddie Bauer or request a catalog, we collect information that you volunteer: your name, email address, postal address, phone number, payment information, and other information necessary to process your order or send you the catalog. We also collect the information you provide to us when you register for "My Account," participate in a contest or sweepstakes promotion, fill out a survey or questionnaire, or contact us (for example via email, "Ask Eddie" or "Live Chat"). The information you supply to us is added to our customer database.
Information about use of our website: Every time you visit our website, we automatically collect your Internet service provider's address, the Web page from which you came, and a record of your activity on our site. We may gather some of this information automatically.
Information about visits to retail locations: We use mobile location analytics technology at our U.S. retail spaces to gain aggregate insights about customer behavior. The data collected is anonymous and works by sensing the presence of Wi-Fi enabled devices. This technology collects and hashes Media Access Control (MAC) addresses from Wi-Fi enabled devices that come in contact with our network equipment. In addition, this technology collects signal strength, time and date, the manufacturer of the device, and the name of a Wi-Fi network currently connected to the device, if applicable. A MAC address is a unique identifier assigned to every mobile device and is not the device's phone number. Collection of mobile location information only occurs when a device's Wi-Fi setting is turned on.
Information from third parties: We may collect information from third parties, including business partners and marketing agencies. This may include your contact information from marketing partners when we engage in joint marketing or co-branding activities, your IP address or location information from service providers to offer certain products and services relevant to you or your location, and data from your social networks to authenticate your product use with us, or that you grant permission to our products or services to access.
We may combine information we collect in different ways, and combine it in your customer profile.
How do you use my information?
Generally speaking, we use personal information to provide, improve, and develop our products and services, to communicate with you, to offer you targeted advertisements, and to protect us and our users.

Providing, improving, and developing our products and services:  We use your information to help us provide, improve, and develop our services, which is necessary for us to pursue our legitimate interest and provide you with quality services and products. The information we receive allows us to tailor our product offerings and improve your shopping experience, making shopping easier and more enjoyable.

Companies other than Eddie Bauer
Our privacy policy does not apply to companies other than Eddie Bauer. Companies other than Eddie Bauer are sometimes identified on our website, catalog or marketing materials. If you make a purchase from another company's catalog or website, the information you provide to that company, such as your credit card number and contact information, is provided to that company and not to Eddie Bauer.

However, you should know that the company may, if you do not advise them to the contrary, share your name and postal and email addresses with third parties, including Eddie Bauer. You should also know that these companies have their own privacy and data collection practices and are not covered by the Eddie Bauer privacy statement. We are not responsible for the privacy practices employed by those third parties, nor are we responsible for the information or content their products and services contain.
For more information, including privacy policies, regarding such companies please see that company's home page and click on their Information link; or review the customer service section of any catalog you may receive from that company.

How to Report Fraud
You can help us identify attempts at fraud.
Eddie Bauer will never ask you for sensitive personal information in an email.
If you receive a suspicious email appearing to come from Eddie Bauer, such as one requesting that you confirm personal information like your credit card number, or if you have received an email implying that it has been sent by Eddie Bauer after you have Opted Out of receipt of Eddie Bauer emails, you may forward the suspicious email to abuse@eddiebauer.com.
You should not respond directly to suspicious email. And do not click on or open any hyperlink embedded in the suspicious email.
There are a few common features of fraudulent emails that can help you identify them as spam. The two most frequent are:
receiving an email that contains mistakes such as misspelled words or grammatical errors, and
receiving an email that asks for your confidential information or asks you to take immediate action on your account.
We encourage all of our customers to protect themselves and their information:
do not share your credentials or account information with any third party, and
make sure that your system is properly patched, running anti-virus and a personal firewall.
If you have already provided information in response to a suspicious email that appeared to have been sent by Eddie Bauer, you may report the suspicious email by forwarding it to abuse@eddiebauer.com.
For more information on how to protect yourself and your personal information, you can visit the antiphishing Working Group's website at http://www.antiphishing.org/consumer_recs.html.
Thank you for helping us monitor and prevent fraud.
