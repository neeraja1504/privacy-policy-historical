Privacy And Security | Company Information | Eddie Bauer
Overview
In 1920, Eddie Bauer wrote his business creed, a statement explaining the services he'd provide for his customers. We still follow this same creed today: "To give you such outstanding quality, value, service and guarantee that we may be worthy of your high esteem." Here at Eddie Bauer, we take this promise seriously and we firmly believe in your privacy and the security of your personal information. We are committed to using any information you give us in a responsible manner. You're very important to us and we want to provide you with a safe and secure online experience.
Complete Privacy Policy
What Personal information does Eddie Bauer collect about me?
Personal information is information about an identifiable individual. Personal information includes such things as your name, address, age, income, date of birth, gender, financial information and credit records, as well as your opinions, preferences and purchase patterns.
We collect personal information only for the uses described in this privacy policy. We may update this policy from time to time and will notify you by posting such changes onour website and strongly encourage you to regularly check back.
We collect personal information in a number of ways: directly from you, indirectly from you, and occasionally from third parties.
Directly
When you purchase from Eddie Bauer or request a catalog, we collect information that you volunteer such as your name, email address, postal address, phone number and other information necessary to process your order or send you the catalog.
We collect the information you provide to us when you register for "My Account", enroll in our loyalty rewards program, participate in a contest or sweepstakes promotion, fill out a survey or questionnaire, or contact us (for example via email, "Ask Eddie" or "Live Chat".)
Indirectly
Every time you visit our website, we automatically collect your Internet Protocol service provider's address (or "IP address"), the Web page from which you came, and a record of your activity on our site. We may also collect information about your browser, such as screen resolution, installed plug-ins and fonts, and information about how your browser renders text.
Cookies are small text files that contain a unique identifier which is placed on your computer. When you visit a website, the website saves the file with a matching identifier. When you revisit the site days or weeks later, the site can recognize you by matching the cookie on your computer with the matching identifier in its database. For more information on "Cookies", see below.
We use mobile location analytics technology at our U.S. retail spaces to gain aggregate insights about customer behavior. The data collected is anonymous and works by sensing the presence of Wi-Fi enabled devices. No personal information is collected. This technology collects and hashes Media Access Control (MAC) addresses from Wi-Fi enabled devices that come in contact with our network equipment. In addition, this technology collects signal strength, time and date, the manufacturer of the device, and the name of a Wi-Fi network currently connected to the device, if applicable. A MAC address is a unique identifier assigned to every mobile device and is not the device's phone number. Collection of mobile location information only occurs when a device's Wi-Fi setting is turned on.

How to Report Fraud
You can help us identify attempts at fraud.
Eddie Bauer will never ask you for sensitive personal information in an email.
If you receive a suspicious email appearing to come from Eddie Bauer, such as one requesting that you confirm personal information like your credit card number, or if you have received an email implying that it has been sent by Eddie Bauer after you have Opted Out of receipt of Eddie Bauer emails, you may forward the suspicious email toabuse@eddiebauer.com.
You should not respond directly to suspicious email. And do not click on or open any hyperlink embedded in the suspicious email.
There are a few common features of fraudulent emails that can help you identify them as spam. The two most frequent are:
a) receiving an email that contains mistakes such as misspelled words or grammatical errors, and
b) receiving an email that asks for your confidential information or asks you to take immediate action on your account.
We encourage all of our customers to protect themselves and their information:
a) do not share your credentials or account information with any third party, and
b) make sure that your system is properly patched, running anti-virus and a personal firewall.
If you have already provided information in response to a suspicious email that appeared to have been sent by Eddie Bauer, you may report the suspicious email by forwarding it toabuse@eddiebauer.com..
