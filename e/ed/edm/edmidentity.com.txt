The information we collect in connection with our online forums and communities is used to provide an interactive experience. We use this information to facilitate participation in these online forums and communities and, from time to time, to offer you products, programs, or services.
If you choose to submit content for publication (e.g., submission through our contact form, a posting to a blog or a discussion board), we may publish your screen name and other information you have provided to us.
