We will only release the information you provide here to the specific colleges you request information from, the agency that handles their information requests, or as required to do so by law. Education Value will not use the information we collect to contact you directly. When you request information from a specific school, members of that school may contact you to provide you with additional information about the school you expressed interest in. At Education Value, we may use the information we collect to understand trends and usage patterns to improve the quality and browsing experience of our site.
When you submit information to a particular school, that information is also governed by the privacy policy of that particular school.
