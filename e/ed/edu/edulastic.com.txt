Users can access this data based on their role, for example, students may access data only about their account. Teachers may access data about their own account, or those of students currently or previously enrolled in their classes. Administrators may access data about teachers and students in their school or district, respectively.
To personalize the Services
We use information collected from teachers and administrators to display information and features that may be of interest to you, or tailored to how you use the Services.

We may display names of teachers who have created accounts on the Services to teachers who join the same school or district.

These third parties are required not to use your Personal Data other than to provide these services to us and your school or district. We may share aggregated and de-identified data, such as student responses and scores, with publishers of third-party item banks that you have purchased for the purpose of improving the quality of their assessment questions. If you request that we share data with a third-party partner, such as a curriculum publisher, to provide services to you or your school or district, we will ask you to explicitly provide permission for the data to be shared. We will not disclose Personal Data to third parties for marketing or any purposes not described in this Privacy Policy.

Child Users
Child Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance (“COPPA”)
Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important to us, so we have added protections and restrictions designed to help protect Personal Information relating to children who are less than 13 years of age (“Child Users”). We only collect Personal Information through the Services from a child under 13 where a teacher or administrator from that student’s school or district has agreed to obtain parental consent for that child to use the Services and to disclose Personal Information to us, for the use and benefit of the learning environment. If you are a student under 13, please do not send any Personal Information about yourself to us if your school, district, and/or teacher has not obtained this prior consent from your parent or guardian, and please do not send any personal information other than what we request from you in connection with the Services. If we learn we have collected personal information from a student under 13 without parental consent being obtained by his or her school, district, and/or teacher, or if we learn a student under 13 has provided us Personal Information beyond what we request from him or her, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a student under 13 may have provided us Personal Information in violation of this paragraph, please contact us at support@edulastic.com If you are a school, district, or teacher, you represent and warrant that you are solely responsible for complying with COPPA, meaning that you must obtain advance written consent from all parents or guardians whose children under 13 will be accessing the Services. You are responsible for understanding how any Publisher Software (defined and described below) that you install on behalf of yourself or other users may collect and use information of users of Edulastic’s Services. When obtaining consent, you must provide parents and guardians with this Privacy Policy. You can find you can find a sample parent permission slip here. You must keep all consents on file and provide them to us if we request them. If you are a teacher, you represent and warrant that you have permission and authorization from your school and/or district to use the Services as part of your curriculum, and for purposes of COPPA compliance, you represent and warrant that you are entering into these Terms on behalf of your school and/or district. As a Parent, you have the ability to control information about your Child User. To review, update, or delete information collected from your Child User contact us at support@edulastic.com.
