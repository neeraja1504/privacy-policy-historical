Collection of information
Two types of online data are collected by the Department:
visitor logs and statistics
information provided by users through online forms, registration, databases and feedback (When personal information is collected online through databases and forms for example, a privacy notice informing you how your personal information will be collected, used and protected will be available).
Visitor logs and statistics
The Department's sites gather statistics on users’ online experience. Information collected includes:
visitor server addresses and domains
the times and dates the site was visited
the pages visitors accessed and files downloaded
visitors’ browsers and operating systems.
The main purpose for collecting this information is to provide statistical information used for website and system administration. The information does not identify individual users but does identify the computer that is used to access our sites.
Logged information is not disclosed outside of departmental staff or those under contract to conduct maintenance to web server components. We make no attempt to identify individuals from these records unless it is necessary to the investigation of a breach of law.
User information
Some Department sites require visitors to provide personal information when they engage in online activities such as subscribing to conferences, participating in departmental email discussion groups, registering online for education activities, completing online forms and feedback. Personal information collected may include a visitor’s first and last name, postal address, email address, employer, job title and department, telephone and fax numbers. The Department will inform you how your personal information will be used at the point of collection.
Internet risks
Any personal information collected is used for the purpose of providing access to online services and monitoring such access. All Department staff have a legal duty to protect the privacy of your personal information and ensure it is used only for the purpose to which you have agreed. The Department does not make available to third parties (other than departmental staff or those under contract to conduct maintenance to web server components) any of your personal information which is stored on this website; unless you are a student enrolled at a Victorian Government school. If you are a student enrolled at a Victorian Government school then the Department may provide any parent, guardian or other person with responsibilities in relation to you with access to your personal information which is stored on this website. Personal information is handled in accordance with Victorian privacy legislation and is stored and disposed of in accordance with Department's Record Keeping Policy.
There are inherent risks associated with the transmission of personal information via the internet as it is not a secure medium. Do not provide any secure personal information online such as a password or credit card number or information that you wish to keep confidential.
The Department has made every effort to implement security policies, rules and measures to protect your information from unauthorised access, improper use, alteration and destruction.
