Privacy
Our Commitment to Protection of Personal Information
Your privacy is important. Whether you are browsing for information or conducting business with the Government of Prince Edward Island, your information is personal and must be protected. You also have the right to be informed how and why we collect, use and share your personal information.
The Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FOIPP) governs the collection of all personal information handled by Government of Prince Edward Island organizations.
You Have a Choice
If you choose not to use the Internet to provide personal information to a government department or agency, you may contact the department or agency by telephone, fax, mail, or in person. (Not all options may be available in every situation.)
Collection of Personal Information
What happens when I provide government with personal information online?
Only the personal information necessary to respond to your message and to provide the requested service or product may be collected. For example, you may voluntarily provide government with your name, address, phone number, e-mail address and/or credit card number, if you wish to:
submit an e-mail, comment, question or request or subscribe for information online
request a service, product or fill out a registration or license form online
provide feedback, participate in consultations, research or surveys online
conduct e-commerce transactions with a department or agency.
Information is collected in compliance with the FOIPP Act to fulfill the stated purpose for which it was originally collected. Your personal information is disclosed only to the authorized personnel who need it to process and respond to your request.
