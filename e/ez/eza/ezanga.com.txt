Privacy Policy | eZanga.com, Inc.
Updated: February 2018
eZanga.com, Inc. (“eZanga”) is a digital marketing company that constantly strives to provide excellent customer service and transparency to our advertisers, customers, and users engaging with advertising from our clients. Your privacy is very important to us. As such, this privacy policy explains how information is collected or used to create and maintain eZanga services for use by our clients. Please note that we are not responsible for the information collection practices of websites linked to our site. We encourage you to review those sites’ privacy policies before submitting any private information.
What information do we collect?
eZanga does employ a variety of methods for collecting information about those that visit our Internet properties. Such methods include:
Cookies:
A "cookie” is a small file that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. This enables us to store user preferences, track user trends, and monitor search patterns. A cookie aggregates non-personally identifiable information about the visitors to our website. A cookie does not collect personally identifiable information that is unique to you, such as credit card numbers, bank accounts, social security numbers, home addresses, email addresses, and other personal information.
We use non-personally identifiable cookies to improve the quality of eZanga’s services and to better understand how users interact with us. We do not and cannot use cookies to retrieve individual, personally identifiable, information about you from your computer unless you knowingly and willingly provided such information.
The cookie technology cannot obtain information from your hard drive or pass on a computer virus. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some eZanga.com features or services may not function properly without cookies.
If you want to learn more about cookies, or how to control or delete them, please visit http://www.aboutcookies.org for additional information.
Phone Services:
eZanga offers pay per call marketing with unique telephone numbers to be used on websites, emails, mobile, and offline promotions. This enables eZanga and our clients to use information about what a consumer was viewing when they made the phone call and aids in personalizing the customer experience.
eZanga may also collect information from third-party databases, including the name, address, and/or geographic location of the caller when such information is available. This information remains anonymous but can be used to optimize our marketing and product development initiatives in order to provide a better user and client experience.
eZanga may also use third-party services or technology for the recordings, transcriptions, or analysis of phone calls and recorded information. In the event that eZanga records a call on behalf of a client, eZanga will ensure that call participants are advised of the existence and intent of the recording in a manner consistent with applicable state and federal laws. eZanga is not responsible in any way for the accuracy and validity of the content of any such recordings, and takes no steps to evaluate such accuracy or validity.
eZanga strongly encourages responsible marketing practices and the share of information for all clients and their partners. The collection, use, and disclosure of information by clients and their partners are subject to their own respective privacy policies. These policies may differ from eZanga’s policy.
Pixels/Web Beacons:
eZanga uses third-party applications throughout our website which do rely on pixels, or a tiny image embedded on the web page that allows us to know you have seen the page. They also allow us to create, update, and read our own cookies.
Device IDs:
A Device ID (device identification) is a distinctive number associated with a smartphone or similar handheld device. Device IDs are accessible by Publishers and can be passed to eZanga with a request. These Device IDs do not enable eZanga to identify individuals, but rather can be used for certain advertising purposes. They can be used to limit the number of times a specific advertisement is presented to the same device, track a device to show that the device interacted with an ad (i.e. “clicked” on it, watched a video ad, or downloaded an application as a result of an advertisement). If eZanga stores a Device ID, it would be for these advertising administrative purposes, and would not be used to create profiles of end-users over time. eZanga may also partner with third parties that have their own methods of identifying a device. These can be used as described above, or in some cases can be used for the purpose of supporting third-party targeted advertising solutions. Where these solutions are employed, eZanga will work with our Exchanges or otherwise endeavor to provide end-users with the ability to opt-out of these solutions.
Why does eZanga collect this information?
eZanga collects some anonymous information each time you visit eZanga.com so we can improve the overall quality of your online experience. We collect your IP address, referral data, and browser and platform type. You do not have to register with eZanga before we can collect this anonymous information. We do not collect any unique information about you (such as your name, email address, etc.) except when you specifically and knowingly provide such information.
eZanga assigns an anonymous ID number to your requests and links the following additional data to that number: the date and time you visited eZanga.com, and the links upon which you chose to click. Like most standard website servers, we use log files to collect and store this anonymous user information. We analyze this information to examine trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. eZanga.com may present links in a format that enables us to understand whether they have been followed. We use this information to understand and improve the content of eZanga.com.
eZanga may also develop statistical user profiles of generic consumer needs and interests by collecting both internet browsing and online purchase data, along with phone user information. This improves our audience targeting and therefore our core products. Some eZanga services may use marketing technology to allow advertisers to supplement non-personally-identifying demographic information, such as age, gender, area code, or ZIP code, to the non-identifiable profile data.
Does eZanga share user information with others?
We may share aggregated general information about our site with our corporate partners or clients. Examples of this include the daily number of unique visitors or how many users clicked on a particular advertisement. Aggregated data does not contain any personally identifiable information that could be used to contact or identify you.
We may share personally identifying information to other companies or individuals in any of the following limited circumstances:

These companies may use technologies to measure the effectiveness of ads and emails and use information about your visits to eZanga.com so that we can provide a better experience to you. For this purpose, we may also provide these third-party service providers anonymous information about your site navigation. Some of those third parties may use this information to tailor advertising to your interests.
We may share certain information about you with carefully selected business partners, including those who may offer services that complement those provided by us or which we believe may be of interest to you.
