Privacy Policy
Data Protection
Any information you provide us with will only be disclosed in accordance with laws of your legal jurisdiction.
Required Information
To open an Ezyaccount you must tell us your name, email address, date of birth and postal address. For security, you must also submit your password and may be required to answer a security question. In order to deposit money into your Ezyaccount and make withdrawals you need to register your debit card or bank account details. We only collect the information that is required for us to process your transactions securely and protect you against fraud.
Transaction Information
In order to process a transaction, we need to know the amount of money sent or requested and the email address of the parties involved.
Disclosure of Information
We will NEVER disclose any of your personal information without your consent. Your debit card, bank account details or Ezyaccount account balance will NEVER be revealed to anyone you have paid or who has paid you. This makes Ezyaccount transactions more private and secure than sending a Cheque or using your debit card.
