Privacy Policy - EziBuy Australia
We have put in place the following policy to protect your personal information. By using our website and/or providing information to us, you consent to the collection, storage, use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this policy.
In this policy, "personal information" means information about an identifiable individual.
What personal information do we collect?
You may give us personal information about yourself, such as your name, address, email address, credit card details and telephone numbers, when, for example, you become an EziBuy member, request a catalogue or make a purchase from us. If you do not give this information, we may not be able to provide goods or services to you.
When you visit our website we may collect more personal information, such as the address of your Internet service provider, the name of the web page directing you, and your clicks and activity on our site.
Remarketing with Google Analytics and others
We use Remarketing through Google Analytics and other third party providers to advertise online by delivering EziBuy ad content to you which is specifically targeted to your interests based on your visits to our website. Third-party vendors, including Google and Bazaarvoice, show EziBuy ads on sites across the Internet. Please see the Cookies section below for further information.
EziBuy website visitors who wish to opt out of Google Analytics or Bazaarvoice for Display Advertisers and/or customized Display Network ads can do so by visiting Google's Ads Preferences Manager or Bazaarvoice's opt-out mechanisms (the NAI opt-out page or the DAA opt-out page). You can also download the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.
How do we use the personal information?
We may use your personal information to process your transactions, to administer your account, to conduct credit and other checks, for our own internal purposes (such as risk management, staff training and billing), to facilitate our online services (including to provide the services contemplated by our Website Acceptable Use Policy), to help us to develop our website to be more available and user friendly to our customers, and for any other use associated with such purposes or which you may authorise.
In addition, we may use your personal information to promote and market our products and services, or the products and services of others. However, we will not do this by email or text (except as part of an email which facilitates, completes or confirms a transaction with you) unless we have your express, inferred or deemed consent to do so. These emails and texts will always include an "unsubscribe" facility. (for further details on how to unsubscribe see below).
Some uses of your personal information may involve the transfer of that information outside Australia, to be held and used by our related companies and business partners.
Will we disclose your personal information to others?
We do not sell, trade or rent your personal information to others without your consent.
However, we do use other companies and individuals to perform services on our behalf, such as delivering packages, sending mail and emails, credit checking and processing payments. They will have access to your personal information needed to perform and provide these services, but we will not authorise them to use your personal information for other purposes.
We also disclose (including by transfer to another country) your personal information to our related companies and business partners, such as financial services or insurance companies, for them to offer products and services to you. This information may include scrambled credit card details, although these will only be used with your consent for any transactions with them. If you do not wish your personal information to be disclosed, call us on 1800 148 148 or email us at mail@ezibuy.com.au.
In addition, we may provide statistics with personal identifiers removed about our customers, readers, sales, traffic patterns and related site functions to reputable third parties. We may use service providers to assist us to aggregate and anonymise such information, so that it does not include any information from which an individual can be identified. We do not consider such aggregated and anonymised information to be personal information and its use is not subject to this policy.
We may also disclose your personal information where such disclosure is required by law.
