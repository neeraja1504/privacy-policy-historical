INTRODUCTION

E&E News is a news organization focusing on energy and the environment. Our five daily publications (collectively, our “Services”) deliver original and compelling journalism that keeps top decisionmakers in government, business, NGOs and academia informed and ahead of the curve. E&E’s success as an independently owned news organization -- established in 1998 – relies on producing timely and objective reporting that our subscribers from all sides of the issues value and trust.
We created this Privacy and Data Practices Policy (“Privacy Policy”) in order to demonstrate our commitment to you (“you” or “your”), our Subscribers, Registered Users, Visitors and Audience Members (all defined below), regarding your privacy with respect to information that we collect about you or that you submit to Us via the Services or through our internet website located at https://www.eenews.net/ (the “Website”).

This Privacy Policy does not apply to information of any kind that we collect by means (including offline means) or from sources other than those specified herein.
PERSONAL INFORMATION
As used in this Privacy Policy, “Personal Information” means any information or set of information about an identified or identifiable natural person, where an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified by all means reasonably likely to be used by any person to identify the natural person directly or indirectly. “Personal Information” does not include information that is not associated with an identified or identifiable individual or information that is reported in the aggregate (provided that such aggregated information is not identifiable to a natural person), and does not include information as to which identifying characteristics have been removed without means reasonably likely to be used by any person to re-identify the natural person directly or indirectly.

Where we collect or receive Personal Information about you directly from you, we will explain the purposes for which we collect and use such Personal Information, the types of third parties to which we disclose that information, and the choices and means, if any, we offer you for limiting the use and disclosure of Personal Information about you. This explanation will be provided as soon as practicable and, in any event, before we disclose your Personal Information or use such information for a purpose materially different than that for which it was originally collected or processed.

Opting Out of Marketing Communications

ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ONWARD TRANSFER
The Website is hosted and the Services are provided in the United States of America. In the performance of our Services and business operations, Personal Information we collect or receive may be stored or transferred internationally throughout our organization and to our service providers or agents, in accordance with applicable data privacy laws. Transfers to third parties are covered by the provisions in this Privacy Policy under Notice and Choice.
We will endeavor to obtain assurances that any such service provider or agent will provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by this Privacy Policy and will notify us if it makes a determination it can no longer meet this obligation.
We use model contractual clauses and other mechanisms approved by the European Union and Switzerland, respectively, for transfers of Personal Information from the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and Switzerland.
Where we know that any third party to whom we have provided Personal Information is using or disclosing Personal Information in a manner contrary to this Privacy Policy, we will take reasonable steps to prevent or stop the use or disclosure. With respect to such onward transfers to agents, and to the extent we are responsible for the event, we will remain liable should our agents process Personal Information in a manner inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.
DATA INTEGRITY AND PURPOSE LIMITATION
We endeavor to use Personal Information only in ways that are compatible with the purposes for which it was collected or subsequently authorized by the Individual. We will take reasonable steps designed to ensure that only Personal Information that is relevant to its intended use, accurate, complete, current, and otherwise reliable in relation to the purposes for which the information was obtained is used by us for as long as we retain possession of such information. Our personnel have a responsibility to assist us in maintaining accurate, complete and current Personal Information. We endeavor only to process Personal Information that is relevant to our Services, and for purposes compatible with those for which the Personal Information was collected; wherever possible, such Personal Information is non-identified.

In addition, upon your request, we will take reasonable steps to correct, amend, or delete your Personal Information that is found to be inaccurate, incomplete or processed in a manner non-compliant with this Privacy Policy or applicable law, except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to your privacy, where the rights of persons other than you would be violated or where doing so is otherwise consistent with applicable law. Unless prohibited by applicable law, we reserve the right to charge a reasonable fee to cover costs for providing copies of Personal Information that you request.
Please note that while any amendments, corrections or deletions will be reflected in active user databases (as updated with a reasonable period of time), we may retain all Personal Information for backups, archiving, prevention of fraud and abuse, analytics, and satisfaction of other legal obligations we reasonably believe applicable.
You authorize us to use and disclose any new or modified information that you provide in accordance with this Privacy Policy, and you agree that we are under no obligation to delete or modify information that you have previously chosen to provide us as to which you have not instructed us to take such action. Please remember, however, that if we have already disclosed some of your Personal Information to third parties, we cannot access that Personal Information any longer and cannot force the deletion or modification of any such information by the parties to whom we have made those disclosures.
We may retain your Personal Information to comply with laws, prevent fraud, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our contracts, and take other actions otherwise permitted by law.
RECOURSE, ENFORCEMENT AND LIABILITY
We encourage you to raise questions about our processing or disclosure of your Personal Information by contacting us, as set forth in the “Contact Us” section below.
