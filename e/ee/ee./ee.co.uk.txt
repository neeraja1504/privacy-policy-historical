to confirm that your orders have been received and to process them, to validate you as a registered customer when using our services and calling our customer services;

to send you certain communications (including by email and SMS) such as service announcements and administrative messages and other communications relating to our services (such as functionality changes to our website, changes to our terms and conditions and to remind you about your customer benefits). Please note that you will not be able to opt out of receiving these essential service communications;

to ensure security for you and our staff, and help maintain service quality (calls to our customer services may be monitored and/or recorded for authentication, security, quality and training purposes);
to check that your home or office or other location is covered by our network and to optimise your network coverage and our network. We will use your location information for network customer experience management and for reporting of network issues in particular areas. Read more about the types of location information we may collect about you:
for the management of traffic;
to trace nuisance or malicious calls;
to help the emergency services;

to segment our customer base and help us develop offers, products and services to provide you with the best customer experience;
to market and advertise our products and services, EE Group products and services and occasionally third party products and services that may be of interest to you including third party offers, promotions, advertisements, competitions or commercial communications by telephone (mobile and landline when available), post, electronic messaging (including SMS and MMS), email or online or via applications. You may be contacted by our Group companies for these purposes. For details of how to opt out of marketing communications, please see How to access and control your personal information;
to recommend packages for you based on your use of our products and services e.g. if you regularly exceed your voice or data plan, we may suggest you moving to a better tariff;
to contact you to invite you to form part of our consumer panel or research groups about our products and services or customer satisfaction surveys (you may be contacted by third parties on our behalf);
to provide you with personalised services and communications as well as targeted advertising from EE on our EE website and selected partner websites. This may involve the use of cookies and other similar technologies.  Please see the link about our Cookies Policy at the bottom of this section;
to enable third parties to tailor adverts which are more relevant and useful to you when you are browsing the internet or are using mobile applications. This may involve the use of cookies and other similar technologies. Personalisation may be based on various factors such as your age and gender, your device details or your inferred interests but we will not share any information with these third parties which directly identifies you. However, by interacting with or viewing an advert, you should be aware that the third party may make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the advert.  You can opt out of targeted advertising from third parties. For more information, please visit www.youronlinechoices.com/uk. However, please note that this will not opt you out of receiving adverts altogether – it simply means that the adverts will not be targeted to you.  We may use your location if you have told us that you are interested in location based offers and services.  Read more about the types of location information we may collect about you;
to create anonymous and aggregated reports about our customers, traffic and network usage patterns. We may use information about your mobile network usage and your location for analytics purposes but we will only retain this information in an anonymised form to ensure that you cannot be identified as an individual. Please see the link about EE Analytics at the bottom of this section.
3. Who We Share Your Personal Information With
We may share your personal information with:
the EE Group (this means EE Limited, its subsidiaries and any parent undertakings as defined in the Companies Act 2006);
other third parties where you have given your consent to the disclosure (either to us or the third party);
our service providers including for the provision, distribution, delivery and marketing of our products and services, for advertising and payment services purposes.
These service providers have to follow our express instructions in respect of the use of your personal information and they must comply with appropriate security measures to protect your personal information. We may transfer your personal information to countries outside of the European Economic Area (the EEA, i.e. the 28 European Union Member States, as well as Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein), which do not always provide the same level of data protection as the UK, for the purposes of providing you with our products and services. If we do make such a transfer, we will put a contract in place with our service providers including security obligations on them to ensure that your personal information is protected in accordance with UK standards:
credit reference agencies and fraud prevention agencies;
debt collection or debt tracing agencies;
insurance providers if you have purchased an insurance policy through us;
law enforcement agencies, regulators, courts and public authorities. This may include sharing your mobile number with the Environment Agency if you live in a flood risk area where a flood warning service is in operation (unless you have opted out of this service via the Environment Agency);
emergency services; and
our prospective or actual purchasers, sellers or partners and their advisers if we decide to sell, buy, merge or otherwise re-organise our business.
If you buy a product or service using Payforit (or other technology which allows you to buy products or services from third parties using your EE account), your contract for that service or product will be with the party selling the product or service (the “seller”) and not EE. In these circumstances, EE has agreed with the seller simply to charge the amount directly to your bill or prepay account. When choosing to pay by mobile, you are either entering your mobile number or agreeing that EE may pass your number onto the seller in order to complete the transaction. The seller will use your mobile number in accordance with its privacy policy and applicable terms and conditions.

5. How Long We Keep Your Personal Information
The periods for which we keep your information depend on the purpose for which your information was collected and the use to which it is put.  We will not keep your personal information for longer than necessary for our business purposes or for legal requirements.
Data relating to the destination, routing, timing or duration of your communications are kept for 12 months to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations (even if you stop using our services).
Some account information will be held for 6 years from the end of your contract with us.
We will keep your contact information for a reasonable period after your contract with us has finished in case you decide to use our services again and may contact you about our services during this time if you have not opted out of marketing.
