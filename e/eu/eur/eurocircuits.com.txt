While navigating Eurocircuits’ web site you may be directed to content or functionality that is hosted by a third-party supplier, not on eurocircuits.com. This is typically done to host special events, such as contests or to organize online payments. When information is collected on behalf of Eurocircuits exclusively, Eurocircuits’ privacy policy will be referenced on the site and will govern how your information is used. For other, non-Eurocircuits sites, the site owner’s privacy policy will be referenced. It is Eurocircuits’ practice to require such suppliers to handle information in a manner consistent with Eurocircuits’ privacy and security policies.
We will ask for your consent before we use or share your information for any purpose other than the reason you provided it or as otherwise provided by this policy.

When we transfer sensitive personal data (for example, credit card information) over the Internet, we protect it using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology. While we strive to protect your Personal Information, we cannot ensure the security of the information you transmit.
We recommend you to take every precaution in protecting your Personal Information when you are on the Internet. For example, change your passwords often, use a combination of letters and numbers when creating passwords, and make sure you use a secure browser.

to the Internet using a router.

Other Eurocircuits web pages, particularly those which require a login and password, require cookies and cannot be used when you have disabled cookies in your browser. In addition, Eurocircuits uses web beacons in conjunction with cookies to understand user behavior. Web beacons are simply a convenient way of gathering basic statistics and managing cookies, and do not give away any extra information from your computer. Turning off your browser’s cookies will prevent web beacons from tracking your specific activity.

Eurocircuits does not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have collected Personal Information on a child under the age of 13, we will delete that data from our systems. Eurocircuits encourages parents and guardians to go online with their children. Here are a few tips to help make a child’s online
experience safer:
__Teach children never to give Personal Information (such as name, address, phone number, school, etc.) unless supervised by a parent or responsible adult.
__Know the sites your children are visiting and which sites are appropriate.
__Look for website privacy policies. Know how your child’s information is treated.
