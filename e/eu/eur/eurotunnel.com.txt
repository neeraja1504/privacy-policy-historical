Where you give us consent:
We will send you direct marketing in relation to our products and services, or other products and services provided by us, our affiliates and carefully selected partners.
We place cookies and use similar technologies in accordance with our Cookies Policy and the information provided to you when those technologies are used.

How do we justify our legitimate interests?
We have carried out balancing tests for all the data processing we carry out on the basis of our legitimate interests, which we have described above. You can obtain information on our balancing tests by contacting us on the details below.
The provision of some information, such as the details you provide so we can send you marketing communications, is optional. However, in certain circumstances we will not be able to provide the services and/or products you have requested if we are not provided with all relevant personal data.
How long will Eurotunnel keep your personal data?
Where we process your personal data in connection with the provision of our services, we keep the data for 6 years after you travel with us (except for your IP address which we keep for 2 years).
Where we process your personal data for marketing purposes or with your consent, we process the data for 3 years after you travel with us or until you ask us to stop and for a short period after this (to allow us to implement your requests). We also keep a record of the fact that you have asked us not to send you direct marketing or to process your data indefinitely so that we can respect your request in future.
We maintain administrative and financial records and make backup archive tapes of our IT systems on a monthly basis for disaster recovery management, information security and business management purposes. We retain this data for 15 years.
Recordings of your telephone calls to our contact centre are kept for 7 years in accordance with the requirements of the Financial Conduct Authority.
Images provided by you (for example Instagram images and videos) for use on our social media feed are kept until you ask us to delete them.
CCTV images and recordings are retained for 30 days except where government authorities or law enforcement officials require footage to be preserved, in which case it is retained as long as is legally necessary.
Your IP address is retained in accordance with your cookie preferences.
How will Eurotunnel share your personal data?
We will share your personal data with other members of the Getlink Group to administer and manage group functions, including the provision of our services and products to you.
Your personal data will also be shared with trusted third parties, such as our professional advisers and auditors, insurers, investment management, banks and other organisations which advise us.
If you purchase motor breakdown roadside assistance or personal travel insurance from us we will share your personal information with the companies though which we provide those services.  We do this in accordance with the requirements of the Financial Conduct Authority.  If you agree to receive marketing communications from us, participate in lifestyle, preference or customer satisfaction surveys or enter a competition, we share your personal data with the companies who provide these services with us or on our behalf.
Your personal data will also be shared with government authorities and/or law enforcement officials if required for the purposes above, if mandated by law or if required for the legal protection of our legitimate interests in compliance with applicable laws.
In the event that Eurotunnel is sold or integrated with another business, your details will be disclosed to our advisers and any prospective purchaser’s adviser and will be passed to the new owners of the business.
Your personal data is processed within the European Economic Area ("EEA").  If we share your personal data with third party service providers outside the EEA we will identify the vendors and the non-EEA countries in which they are located here: None.
Where information is transferred outside the EEA, and where this is to a stakeholder or vendor in a country that is not subject to an adequacy decision by the EU Commission, data is adequately protected by EU Commission approved standard contractual clauses, an appropriate Privacy Shield certification or a vendor's Processor Binding Corporate Rules.
If you live outside of the EEA, we will need to transfer your personal data outside of the EEA to respond to any queries that you may have. Where this applies, we will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Notice.
