Posted: October 4, 2018
Effective: October 4, 2018
The American Association for the Advancement of Science ("AAAS") is firmly committed to protecting the privacy of its users. This privacy policy ("Policy") describes how AAAS collects, uses, and shares information, including personal information, when you visit the EurekAlert! website, www.eurekalert.org ("Site"). It also provides a means for you to "opt out" of providing certain personal information.
Information We Collect
The Site is divided into two areas:
A public area accessible to anyone with world wide web resources, and
A restricted area open to registered journalists and public information officers (PIOs).
Information Collected Automatically
When you visit the Site, the following information is collected automatically as part of the Site's operation:
Device information : We collect information about your device, such as the type of browser and operating system you're using and your device's IP address.
Usage information : We collect information such as the name of the website that referred you to us (the last website you visited before this one) and the date and time you access the Site and the duration of your visit.
This information is collected and used in the aggregate only and is not used to identify you personally. Such information enables us to personalize our content to users' needs and to help those organizations that post information to the Site to better understand the demographics of those seeing their materials.
Information You Provide
Personal information is any information that relates to an identified person or information which, together with other information, may identify a person. Below we describe the types of personal information that we collect, how that information is used, and the legal basis for the collection of such information.
Registration information : If you register for an account, we ask for your first and last name, telephone number, email address, and physical address. We also ask for information about your job in order to confirm that you are eligible to create an account on the Site.
Contact information : If you choose to contact us or make a purchase on the Site, we may ask for your name, telephone number, email address, and physical address.
Payment information : We ask for your payment card information if you choose to purchase products or services on the Site.
On some occasions we may ask you to provide personal information on online forms. Providing information on online forms is always voluntary, and you are free not to complete any online forms. If you choose not to complete the forms, however, some products and services may not be available to you.
How We Use Your Information
We use the information that we collect to do the following:
Administer your account;
Process your transactions or fulfill your requests;
Send you information about your relationship or transactions with us;
Process and respond to your inquiries;
Contact you with information that we believe will be of interest to you, such as special events and promotions, new products or services, or other information that may be of interest;
Generate and review reports and data about Site users;
Perform analytics and research aimed at improving the accuracy, effectiveness, usability, or popularity of the Site;
Improve the content and features of the Site or develop new content and features;
Enforce the legal terms that govern your use of the Site;
Administer and troubleshoot the Site; and
For the specific purpose for which you provide information which will be disclosed at the time you provide the information.
How We Share Your Information
We may disclose your personal information as follows:
With third-party service providers that provide certain services related to our Site;
With journal administrators if you create an account and request access to a journal so that you may be granted access to such journal;
With third parties in response to any subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process we receive; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law;
With third parties such as law enforcement, government agencies, courts, and/or other organizations when we believe in good faith that a disclosure is appropriate in order to investigate, prevent, or take action against possible violations of this Policy or the Site Terms & Conditions and/or to protect the rights and property of AAAS, our employees, users, or the public;
With third parties such as law enforcement, government agencies, courts, and/or other organizations when we believe in good faith that a disclosure is appropriate in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding possible illegal activities, suspected fraud, or situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person;
With third parties in connection with any proposed or actual merger, reorganization, transfer of control, a sale of some or all of our assets, or a financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our organization by another company; and
With any third parties if we have your consent to make such a disclosure.
We may also share certain information if we have reason to believe that an individual has violated our embargo policy by obtaining material via someone else's password-approved access. We would only do this in response to a specific request by the journal or research institution that submitted the embargoed document, or by the account holder whose password-approved access may have been compromised, in order to review the embargo violation incident. However, AAAS reserves the right to decline any of these requests if there is not sufficient evidence, in AAAS' sole judgment, to support the charge. If we agree to provide information related to an alleged embargo violation, we will disclose:
Whether or not the person viewed the document for which the embargo was broken;
If so, what time of day he or she viewed it;
Whether his or her request for the file, if made, was successfully fulfilled; and
Other information specifically related to the incident that, in AAAS' sole judgment, is appropriate or necessary to be disclosed.
If AAAS decides to fulfill such a request by a journal or an institution, the user in question will be notified.
Our Legal Bases for Processing and Sharing Your Information
