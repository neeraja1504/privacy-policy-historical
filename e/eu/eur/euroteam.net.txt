In the event of any conflict between the provisions of the references here above, they shall be given priority in the order as listed.
3. Event Specific Terms and Conditions.
Euroteam reserves the right to revise the General Terms and Conditions at any time, and to add to the Contract a prevailing set of Event Specific Terms and Conditions valid and binding for a specific Event. Such amendments will be advised of by posts onwww.euroteam.net, and may in particular be found at the bottom of www.euroteam.net/Terms. Purchaser is therefore advised to periodically check www.euroteam.net for updates. Such revisions and amendments will be given retroactive effect as to apply to all relevant Contracts entered into. When ordering Tickets for the relevant Event, Purchaser hereby expressly agrees to be bound by such Event Specific Terms and Conditions posted on www.euroteam.net/Terms prior to the date of the Event.
4. Delivery of Tickets.
Euroteam shall be obliged to deliver the Tickets in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Contract. Euroteam will be responsible to send and/or deliver the Tickets to the address given by Purchaser. Purchaser is obliged to inform Euroteam of any change in address with respect to where the Tickets may be delivered. However, Euroteam may, at its complete discretion, instruct Purchaser to pick up the Tickets at a pick-up location specified by Euroteam in or nearby the city of the Event. In case of Purchaser’s pick-up of the Tickets, any relevant delivery charge paid by Purchaser will be refunded. Delivery shall take place upon arrival of the Tickets to the address appointed by Purchaser, or when made available on the relevant location for pick-up as the case may be, whichever occurs first. There after, the risk for the Tickets (including but not limited to the risk of loss of-, damage to- and theft of the Tickets) shall be transferred to Purchaser.
Euroteam may at its sole discretion request that Purchaser after ordering the Tickets, provides Euroteam with a copy of any credit cards used for ordering of Tickets or a copy of Purchasers identification papers, such as Purchaser’s passport. Euroteam is entitled to retain any ordered Tickets until such satisfactory documentation is received.
Purchaser shall warrant and ensure reception of the Tickets, and if necessary contact and actively liaise with the Postal/Courier Company, and/or any other delivery person, to make sure that the Tickets are received by Purchaser. Euroteam shall not be responsible for any delivery failures due to incomplete contact and delivery information given by Purchaser, neither lack of satisfactory reception facilities or cooperation as stated above.
Euroteam will in each Contract indicate date and time of delivery or pick-up of the Tickets. Such dates are for guidance only, and Euroteam reserves the right to deliver the Tickets on the actual day of the relevant Event, within a reasonable time prior to its start on the same day, without becoming in breach of the Contract. If the Tickets are not delivered within such a reasonable time on the same day, the provisions of Clause 6 shall apply.
Purchaser is hereby informed of that Euroteam may not be in possession of Tickets ordered hereunder at time of entry into Contract. Subsequent to formation of the Contract, Euroteam will subject to the other provisions of the Contract obtain such Tickets in the second hand market.
5. Price and Payment.
Purchaser shall pay the Ticket price as stipulated in the Contract, and in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof. Invoices must be paid in its entirety within the due date(s) set forth in such invoice(s) or the Order Confirmation.
Pursuant to Norwegian law, Euroteam hereby discloses, and Purchaser hereby acknowledges, that the stated Ticket price in most cases contains a service charge or profit which has been added to the face value of, or to Euroteam`s price for, the Tickets. Typically, the price charged for a Ticket is substantially over face value. The amount charged over the face value of the Tickets represents Euroteam’s cost and mark up of obtaining the Tickets in the secondary market, and our fair compensation for the work and difficulty involved in obtaining Tickets for hard-to-get and sold-out Events.
Upon any breach of the provisions above in this Clause 5, Euroteam may, upon notice, terminate the Contract with immediate effect. Euroteam shall not incur any liability with respect to such termination, and reserves any right it may have at law or under contract for Purchasers’ default. Euroteam may in addition keep any partial payments made by Purchaser as compensation for costs incurred and/or loss of profit.
6. Warranty.
In case of failure by Euroteam to deliver the full quantity of Tickets, if the Tickets are not delivered within a reasonable time on the day of the Event, or upon other breach of this warranty, Euroteam will, as the sole liability for breach of this warranty, refund to Purchaser any deposits and/or prepayments made by Purchaser and received by Euroteam for undelivered Tickets ordered under this Contract. In addition Euroteam shall pay as compensation a sum up to 200 % of any such deposits and/or prepayments made by Purchaser and received by Euroteam for undelivered Tickets hereunder. Such compensation shall not, however, exceed EUR 200 per Contract or Customer.
7. Changes and Cancellation.
Upon its formation, the Contract shall be binding and Purchaser cannot cancel the Contract. Subject only to Clauses 6 and 7, all deposits and payments made are non refundable. However, should Purchaser want to cancel the Contract, Euroteam may, in its complete discretion, accept and may by refunding only 50 % of the deposit or prepayment made. Such cancellation must be requested in writing by Purchaser and confirmed in writing by Euroteam.
Double bookings may occur as a result of offline telephone booking and bookings during system maintenance. In case of such double bookings, Euroteam reserves the right to cancel the Contract for any reason within 48 hours after time of Purchaser’s submission of the Order. Without this affecting Euroteam’s cancellation right, notice of such cancellation due to double bookings will be sent to Purchaser by e-mail and/or by post within 48 hours thereafter if such addresses are made available to Euroteam. Any deposit paid and received will be refunded immediately, but Euroteam will not pay any extra compensation, and hereby waives any and all liability under contract or at law for such cancellations.
In case of cancellation of an entire Event, Euroteam reserves the right to cancel the Contract, and will, as the sole liability for such cancellation, refund relevant delivery charges paid and 90 % of the deposit or prepayment made and received. In case of deferment or cancellation of parts of an Event, Euroteam reserves the right to change or cancel the Contract accordingly, but waives any and all liability under contract or at law with respect to such change, deferment or part cancellation, and no refund or compensation will be made.
In case the start time of an Event is moved, and a new Event time is adjusted by less than 48 hours from the original Event time, the Contract shall remain valid and un-amended, and Purchaser shall pay the Contract price as stipulated in the Contract. If such start time of an Event is adjusted by more than 48 hours from the original Event time, Purchaser may without undue delay from he or she ought to gain knowledge of the adjustment claim a 90 % refund of the deposit or prepayment made and received. If no such claim is presented to Euroteam, the Contract shall remain binding and un-amended in accordance with the other provisions of the Contract for the new time set for the Event.
In case the Tickets purchased comprise extra services, such as hospitality package, hotel room, courier delivery, etc., Euroteam reserves the right to reasonably change the details of mentioned services in case any of the third party providers of such extra services change these services to Euroteam. Euroteam will warrant mentioned extra services towards Purchaser only to the extent that the third party providers effectively warrant the same towards Euroteam. Updated information regarding such extra services is available onwww.euroteam.net. Upon change or cancellation of parts of such extra services, Purchaser shall not be entitled to cancel or change the Contract, but the Contract shall remain valid and binding on the terms set out herein. However, upon such change or cancellation, Purchaser may be entitled to claim a reduction in the Contract price if Euroteam does not provide equivalent replacement extra services. Such reduction in the Contract price shall correspond to the difference in value between the extra services initially purchased, and the ones actually delivered.
Euroteam operates with up to four different Ticket categories for an Event. The variations in the Ticket category are based on the categories of the Event organizer, the face value of the Tickets, and the seating locations. Euroteam’s categories are not always identical to the categories which the organizer of the Event operates with, and Purchaser hereby acknowledges and accepts that Euroteam may deliver Tickets which reasonably deviate from the Ticket category of the organizer of the Event without becoming in breach of the Contract. Subject to the above in this paragraph, in the case of delivery of Tickets in a lower Euroteam category than what originally ordered due to reasons within Euroteam’s control, Purchaser shall be entitled to a partial refund as calculated by Euroteam based on Euroteam’s Ticket category prices. For example: Euroteams current prices for an event are 300 EUR for cat.1 and 200 EUR for cat.2. You order one ticket cat.1 but you receive one cat. 2 ticket. In this case you are entitled to a 100 EUR refund from Euroteam.
Purchaser shall be obliged to give information about supporting preferences when ordering Tickets. Euroteam will endeavor to deliver Tickets with seating/located in accordance with the preferred and specified supporter section but may not warrant that these specifications are met. The parties therefore agree that Euroteam will not become in breach of the Contract due to not meeting such specifications. When Tickets are purchased for groups (2 or more persons), Euroteam only warrants seating/location pair wise for Euroteam Ticket category nos. 1 and 2. For Tickets ordered in Euroteam Ticket category nos. 3 and 4 however, these may be with restricted view and not adjacent.
Euroteam might not be able to inform about changes in the Event program or content. Purchaser is therefore requested to check the official Event organizer or Event website for any changes in the Event program or content.
8. Complaints.
If the Purchaser has any complaints or desires to present a claim for refund regarding purchase of Tickets, such complaint or claim must be made in writing and received by Euroteam at the latest 9 weeks after the start date for the relevant Event. Complaints and claims must be sent in the format prescribed on  www.Euroteam.net/EN/Complaints. Purchaser hereby precludes any claim not properly received by Euroteam within this time limit and in the prescribed format. Euroteam will normally review a complaint or claim timely received within four (4) weeks after its receipt by Euroteam.
9. Force Majeure.
Euroteam shall not be liable for any delay in the performance or non-performance of the Contract due an occurrence beyond its control, provided that such occurrence could not have been foreseen by Euroteam at the time of entry into the Contract and it could not have been avoided or its consequences overcome.
10. Purchaser’s Breach of Contract.
If the Purchaser violates the terms of this Contract, Euroteam shall, as being the owner and operator of www.euroteam.net, have the right to, at its option, bar Purchaser from any future use of www.euroteam.net, terminate the Contract immediately and without notice, and/or take the appropriate legal action against Purchaser. Termination of the Contract due to the Purchaser’s breach of the Contract gives the Purchase no right to refunds of any payments made by Purchaser. Furthermore, Euroteam reserves any right and remedy it may have against Purchaser at law or under contract due to Purchaser’s default.
11. Indemnity.
Subject to the provisions of Clauses 6 and 7, Purchaser shall release, defend, indemnify and hold harmless Euroteam, its subsidiaries, suppliers, affiliates, officers, agents and other partners and employees from:
Any loss, damage, liability, claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred by Purchaser in relation to the Contract or use ofwww.euroteam.net (including also Purchaser’s use of www.euroteam.net to provide a link to another website), such as, but not limited to Purchaser’s own special, consequential and indirect losses.

Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary herein, Euroteam`s maximum liability to Purchaser related to performance or non-performance of the Contract, including but not limited to the warranty liability hereunder, shall be limited to 200 % of the total value of deposit and prepayment made to – and received by Euroteam under the Contract.
13. Governing Law – Dispute Resolution..
The relationship between Euroteam and Purchaser shall be governed and interpreted in accordance with Norwegian law, and the parties agree that the City Court of Oslo in Norway shall have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute between the parties, which has not been resolved amicably within a reasonable time from the dispute arose.
