To create a EUROPAGES account, you have to tell us your last name and email address and agree to our Terms and Conditions of Use and this Privacy Policy, which governs the way in which we process your personal data.
By providing us with personal data when you create or modify your account and your profile, you expressly and voluntarily agree to our Terms and Conditions of Use and freely consent to our processing of your personal data in compliance with the terms described in this Privacy Policy. Providing us with any information deemed ‘sensitive’ by applicable law is entirely voluntary on your part.
If you have any reservations about providing information to us or having such information displayed on our services or otherwise used in any manner permitted in this Privacy Policy and the Terms and Conditions of Use, you should not become a member and should cease to visit our websites.

1.5 Communications
When you sign up for an account or to use certain functions, you choose or agree by default to receive messages from other EUROPAGES users, companies and the EUROPAGES site itself.
Members can send requests for information to the companies listed on the site. If you choose to send a request for information using the contact forms on the EUROPAGES website, your personal data, including your email address and any other information you provide, will be visible to the company contacted.
In additional, these messages may be stored, processed or transferred by our servers.
We use them anonymously in the activity feed for our members available on the home page.
This means that part of these messages may appear on the home pages of the different language versions.
Requests for information made using the EUROPAGES system are available for consultation by the member initially addressed and by our customer service employees, who may communicate information on such requests to members or any other person. When required, we may view messages sent via our platform. We may also occasionally use third-party email servers to send and monitor the reception of messages containing requests for information and analyse the usage patterns provided by third-party monitoring systems.
If you represent a company listed on EUROPAGES, we may contact you, including by telephone or email, using the details that you provide us with, that you make publicly accessible or that we have recorded for your establishment.
