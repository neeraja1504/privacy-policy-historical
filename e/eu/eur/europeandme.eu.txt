Europe & Me e.V. is the legal association behind E&M. Our work focuses on magazine production, but also related activities such as workshops, events and participation in project initiatives with various partners across Europe.
Europe & Me e.V. is a network of people who speak up for an increasing European thinking within the societies of Europe.
We support the European dimension of most questions within society and culture. Whether it is a matter of economic and social policies, European codes of values, or the process of learning from a common history – we believe that it’s important to think about modern life from a European angle.
Those questions open up a new European horizon. We don’t put forward a particular view of Europe, but we hope to encourage people to ‘think European’.
