This information is used for billing purposes, and to contact the user in the event a submission cannot be processed.
Information Use
User Profiles: We retain the information collected through log files and via the information users provide during registration and site submission, in order to create profiles.  These profiles are stored data that we maintain on individual users detailing their characteristics. As a result, collected information is tied to users' personally identifiable information in order to improve our customer service and provide offers. User profiles are not shared with third parties.
Log Files: As with most website servers, EuroSeek uses log files. These files include IP (internet protocol) addresses, ISP (internet service provider) information, browser identification, platform identification, referring and/or exit pages, time/date stamps, and the number of clicks.

IP addresses, etc., are not linked to personally identifiable information.
