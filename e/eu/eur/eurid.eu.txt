Privacy Policy
At EURid, we attach great importance to the protection of your privacy. In our privacy policy, we wish to make clear what personal data we process about you, why and for how long we process it, and how you can exercise your rights to manage it.
EURid is responsible for processing your personal data.
We invite you to read our privacy policy and general terms and conditions carefully so you have a good understanding about how we protect your personal data.
Does this privacy policy apply to you?
This privacy policy applies to you if you have come into contact with us, either as an individual holder of a domain name registered under the .eu Top Level Domain or possible .eu variants in other scripts (hereinafter the “ Domain Name ”), as an individual who works for a party with whom we have a contractual relationship, or as a visitor to our premises or websites, or otherwise (via email, telephone, attending one of our events, etc).
Your personal data may be collected via the following methods: through the Domain Name registration processes via our network of accredited registrars, via e-mail, via telephone, via fax, by attendance at an event, by using cookies or other technologies to track visitors on our websites, through communication from suppliers or partners, via a testimonial, via access control tools or by completing a form on our websites, or via any other means. Occasionally, we may also collect your personal data if you have registered a domain name (other than a Domain Name) with another registry via a registrar who inputs your personal data into our registration system.
What personal data do we process about you?
Personal data is any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (i) that you voluntarily provide to us (e.g. through our online forms on our website, testimonials), (ii) that we collect from your visit(s) to our premises, events or website(s) or via your access and use of our products or services (e.g. via your login to my.eurid.eu).
In the context of our business activities and in order to provide you with good service and to improve our services where possible, we may process the following personal data about you: your name, your email, the organization you work for, your job title, your personal address, your language preference, your gender, your age, your unique identification alias in our system, your Domain Name, financial data including data related to your bank account or credit card information, or creditworthiness, judicial data in relation to Domain Names, your IP address; data about your login to and usage of my.eurid.eu, pictures and video footage.
Since it is not possible to register a Domain Name directly with us1, we collect your personal data from the company through which you registered your Domain Name. That company may be one of our accredited registrars2 or one of its resellers who collects your personal data on behalf of EURid.
For which purposes do we process your personal data?
We process your personal data for various purposes:
In order to be able to offer the best possible services for your Domain Name, we must collect some personal data in relation to your Domain Name. This also allows us to identify you and get in touch with you directly in relation to your Domain Name registration, if and when needed.
We are required to maintain a complete and accurate database of all registered Domain Names. The purpose of the WHOIS look-up facility (https://whois.eurid.eu/en/) is to provide accurate and up-to-date information about the technical and administrative contact persons administering the Domain Names3. This helps us in creating and maintaining a trusted and safe Internet environment.
We use your personal data to maintain and build long-term and sustainable relationships and to execute the contract we may have. We use your personal data to respond to your inquiries, to fulfill your requests, and/or to send you administrative information.
Your personal data may be used to comply with applicable regulations, to respond to requests or claims from public and government authorities, including public and government authorities outside your country of residence, or to protect our rights, privacy, safety or property, and/or our entities.
We may use your personal data to send you promotional messages, marketing, advertizing, and other information that may be of interest to you.
On what legal basis do we process your personal data?
We may process your personal data based on different legal grounds:
The processing may be necessary to comply with our legal obligations as a registry or as a data controller.
The processing may be necessary for the execution of your contract with us.
The processing is necessary for the protection of our legitimate interests, in particular: the economic, commercial and financial interests, business continuity, security and confidentiality of customer information and products and the security of digital and physical infrastructure.
In exceptional cases, our processing activities may be based on your consent.
With whom do we share your personal data?
