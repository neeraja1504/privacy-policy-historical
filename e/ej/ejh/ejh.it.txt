Introduction
In accordance with European Union guidelines ( General Data Protection Regulation  ( GDPR), users may decline to provide the information requested. They should be advised, however, that PAGEPress may be unable to deliver its services unless at least the information necessary for security and identification purposes is provided.
In order to offer the best possible service to users, we  tracks the patterns of usage of pages on our sites. This enables us to identify the most popular articles and services. Where users have provided details of their research areas of interest, this information can be correlated, helping PAGEPress to provide a useful service for scientists, offering them the most relevant information based on their areas of interest. User information will only be shared with third parties with the explicit consent of the user.
Publishing a scientific manuscript is inherently a public (as opposed to anonymous) process. The name and e-mail address of all authors of a manuscript published and/or submitted will be available to users of PAGEPress. These details are made available in this way purely to facilitate scientific communication. Collecting these e-mail addresses for commercial use is not allowed, nor will PAGEPress itself send unsolicited e-mail to authors, unless it directly concerns the paper they have published on any PAGEPress journals.
We will only use the personal data gathered over this website as set out in this policy. Below you will find information on how we use your personal data, for which purposes your personal data is used, with whom it is shared and what control and information rights you may have.

Our journals’ sites use cookies to help provide you with the best viewing experience: some aspects of our services published on our website do require the use of cookies, and the supply of information such as name, e-mail address etc. This is necessary for security reasons and also for us to be able to assure standards of scientific integrity.
