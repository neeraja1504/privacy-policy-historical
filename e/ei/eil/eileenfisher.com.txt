These cookies and other similar technologies may include first party cookies (i.e., those placed by the website being visited) and third party cookies (i.e., those placed by a website other than the one being visited), Local Shared Objects (commonly referred to as “LSOs,” "Flash Cookies", or “HTML 5 Cookies”) and tracking pixels (including clear gifs). Cookies can either expire at the end of a session ("Session Cookies") or be persistent and last through multiple sessions ("Persistent Cookies"). Session Cookies can be helpful for remembering items you put in your shopping cart as you browse a website, or for security reasons. Persistent Cookies are stored on your device in between sessions, which allows for your preferences or actions to be remembered and used on a website or across different websites. Persistent Cookies may be helpful in remembering your preferences and choices when using a website or to ensure advertising messages are more relevant to you.

If you disable or refuse cookies, some parts of our website may not function properly. Your web browser may let you choose your preference as to whether you want to allow websites to collect information over time about your online activities across different websites or online services. At this time, we do not respond to such "Do Not Track” or similar preferences you may have configured in your web browser, and we may continue to collect information in the manner described in this Policy.
Third Party Cookies: We partner with advertising companies to place our advertising on other websites on the Internet. These companies may use third party cookies which allow them to develop personalized advertising so that it relates to information that may be of interest to you.
Web Beacons: This is an electronic file on a web page that allows us to count and recognize users who have visited that page. Among other things, a web beacon can be used in HTML-formatted email to determine responses to our communications and measure their effectiveness - for instance, if you get an email from us and click on a link in that email to go to our website.

Another example would be if you place an order with us through one of our merchant suppliers, our merchant supplier may contact you if there is an issue with the order.
