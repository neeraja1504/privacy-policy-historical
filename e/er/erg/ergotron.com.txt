This may happen if other Ergotron entities or venture partners are overseas, if we outsource certain activities overseas or if transactions, information, services or products have an overseas connection.
Your Personal Information may also be disclosed to third-party service providers which may store your Personal Information in the U.S.A. and European Union, and such other countries in which those parties or their, or our, computer systems may be located from time to time, where it may be used for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.
Where required by applicable privacy and data protection laws, we take steps in order to ensure any overseas transfer of Personal Information is effected in compliance with the appropriate organizational and technical means (including e.g. EU Commission’s model clauses for data transfers or European Commission’s adequacy decisions). Where such parties are located overseas, you may have rights to enforce such parties’ compliance with applicable privacy and data protection laws.
