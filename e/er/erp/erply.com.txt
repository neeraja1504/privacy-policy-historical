Privacy Policy
We respect the privacy of your personal and corporate information. This Privacy Policy describes how ERPLY collects, uses and discloses information, and what choices you have with respect to the information. ERPLY Privacy Policy also reflects changes in the new data protection law (GDPR). Under “ERPLY” this Privacy Policy refers to ERPLY entity that acts as controller or processor of your information, as explained in more detail in the “Identifying the Data Controller and Processor” section below.
Applicability Of This Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy applies to ERPLY’s retail ERP software, including the associated ERPLY Point-Of-Sale solutions (collectively, the “Services” ), Erply.com and other ERPLY websites (collectively, the “Websites” ) and other interactions with ERPLY (e.g., customer inquiries, conferences, etc.). If you do not agree with the terms, do not access or use the Services, Websites or any other aspect of ERPLY’s business.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third party applications or software that integrate with the Services through the ERPLY platform ( “Third Party Services” ), or any other third party products, services or businesses. In addition, a separate agreement governs the delivery, access and use of the Services (the “Customer Agreement” ) or other content submitted through Services accounts (collectively, “Customer Data” ). The organization (e.g., your employer or another entity or person) that entered into the Customer Agreement ( “Customer” ) controls their instance of the Services (their “Workspace” ) and any associated Customer Data. If you have any questions about specific Workspace settings and privacy practices, please contact the Customer whose Workspace you use.
Information We Collect And Receive
ERPLY may collect and receive Customer Data, other information and data ( “Other Information” ) in a variety of ways. When you visit or use our Website or Services in any way, we collect and process different types of information about you:
Customer Data. Customers or individuals granted access to a Workspace by a Customer (“Authorized Users”) routinely submit Customer Data to ERPLY when using the Services. Such information can vary depending on your use of the Website or Services. Such information may include your customers or employees personal data such as:
Identity Data including first name, last name, gender, birthday, username or similar identifier, and titles.
Identification Data including loyalty card number and national ID code.
Contact Data including billing address, delivery address, email address, webpage, social media identification, fax, and telephone numbers. Such information can also include contact persons and representatives data.
Professional Data including your authorization level, job title, company information, workplace, and other management and sales related data and goals.
Financial Data including bank, bank account, additional payer person, deadlines, penalties, and credit details. Other financial information can include reward points, coupons, and gift cards.
Transaction Data including details about payments and sales documents to and from you and other details of products and services you have purchased from us.
Marketing and Communications Data including your preferences in receiving marketing from us and our third parties and your communication preferences with your Customers.
Custom information which the Authorized User can add to the person via attributes, extra parameters or attached files.
Other Information. ERPLY also collects, generates and/or receives Other Information:
Log Data may include the Internet Protocol (IP) address, the date and time the Services were used, User identification, and what processing was done. Our servers automatically collect information when you access or use our Websites or Services and record it.
Services Metadata may include logs about features, content, and links you interact with and what Third Party Services are used (if any). When an Authorized User interacts with the Services, metadata is generated that provides additional context about the way Authorized Users work.
Technical Data includes internet protocol (IP) address, time zone setting, and location, Services extension (“Plug-ins”) types and versions, and other technology you use to access for processing purposes of Services.
Profile Data includes account purchases or orders made by you, your preferences, feedback, communications and survey responses, and your login username and password.
Custom information which can vary depending on extra developed functionalities, active Plug-ins or other Customer self-made Plug-Ins and functionalities.
Cookie Information. ERPLY uses cookies and similar technologies in our Websites and Services that help us collect Other Information. The Websites and Services may also include cookies and similar tracking technologies of third parties, which may collect Other Information about you via the Websites and Services and across other websites and online services.
Third Party Services. The customer can choose to permit or restrict Third Party Services. Typically, Third Party Services are software that integrates with our Services, and Customer can permit its Authorized Users to enable and disable these integrations for their Workspace. Once enabled, the provider of a Third Party Service may share certain information with ERPLY. Authorized Users should check the privacy settings and notices in these Third Party Services to understand what data may be disclosed to ERPLY. When a Third Party Service is enabled, ERPLY is authorized to connect and access Other Information made available to ERPLY in accordance with our agreement with the Third Party Provider.
Third Party Data. ERPLY may receive data about organizations, industries, Website visitors, marketing campaigns and other matters related to our business from parent corporation(s), affiliates and subsidiaries, our partners or others that we use to make our own information better or more useful. This data may be combined with Other Information we collect and might include aggregate level data.
Additional Information Provided to ERPLY. We receive Other Information when submitted to our Websites or if you participate in a focus group, contest, activity or event, apply for a job, request support, interact with our social media accounts or otherwise communicate with ERPLY.
Generally, no one is under a statutory or contractual obligation to provide any Customer Data or Other Information (collectively, “Information”). However, certain Information is collected automatically and, if some Information, such as Workspace setup details, is not provided, we may be unable to provide the Services. Moreover, certain information provided by Customer to ERPLY can vary depending on the agreed-upon contractual obligations of both parties and hence this list of data being processed by ERPLY can differ. ERPLY is not obligated to know about the data which the Customer inserts into the ERPLY Services and Websites, and Customer is 100% owner of their data, hence Controller to their data and obligated to follow the current Data Protection Law.
Links to Other Websites
Our Websites and Services may, from time to time, contain links to third-party websites. If you follow a link to any of those third party websites, please note that those websites have their own privacy policies and we do not accept any responsibility or liability for those practices. Please check those policies before you submit any personal data to those websites.
Age Limitations
To the extent prohibited by applicable law, ERPLY does not allow the use of our Services and Websites by anyone younger than 16 years old. If you learn that anyone younger than 16 has unlawfully provided us with personal data, please contact us and we will take steps to delete such information. Insertion of Customer Data containing personal data of individuals younger than 16 years old into ERPLY is prohibited without parental or another guardian lawful permission.
