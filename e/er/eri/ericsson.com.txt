Privacy - Ericsson
Why does privacy matter to Ericsson?
Privacy is fundamental for building trust in the networked society. ICT has the potential to transform how we innovate, collaborate and socialize – but only if networks and services keep information secure and protect the privacy rights of all.
For example, analyzing and acting on the vast amounts of data generated by today’s communication networks can create lasting benefits for everyone. The most effective way to realize this potential is by combining the freedom to innovate and create positive impacts with strong privacy principles that ensure transparency, integrity and appropriate levels of data anonymization. The result is a win-win situation for all stakeholders.
The nature of Ericsson’s business gives us an additional responsibility to work effectively with privacy. More than 40 percent of the world’s mobile traffic passes through networks delivered by Ericsson, and we manage networks that together serve over 1 billion subscribers. We also handle personal information for a workforce of 116,281 people in over 180 countries.
What is Ericsson doing?
We align our business with all legal requirements for privacy. In addition, we have developed a series of clear Ericsson Privacy Principles that form the basis of a comprehensive global privacy program.
This program ensures that privacy is designed into Ericsson’s processes, tools, products and services. It proactively engages with key stakeholders and secures buy-in at every stage of the privacy value chain. The program supports our commitment to ensuring the integrity of all personal information for which we are responsible, and helps our customers to develop trusted relationships with consumers and businesses.
Crucially, respect for the right to privacy is included in our Code of Business Ethics, which defines the behaviors we expect from all Ericsson employees. Along with professionalism and perseverance, the concept of respect is one of Ericsson’s three core values and therefore forms part of the foundation of our company culture.
We recognize that securing privacy in a connected world requires a sustained cross-industry effort. New technologies bring new privacy implications, and continuous dialog between industry, governments, regulators and civil society is essential. Ericsson is committed to driving and participating in these multi-stakeholder discussions.
