Legal requirements. We may disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law in order to, for example, respond to a subpoena or request from law enforcement, a court or a government agency (including in response to public authorities to meet national security or law enforcement requirements), or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect or defend our rights, interests or property or that of third parties, (iii) prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Sites, (iv) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Sites or the public, or (v) protect against legal liability.
PRIVACY SHIELD. Where you are an EEA citizen, we may transfer your personal data outside the European Economic Area (EEA), including to EC’s offices and servers in the USA.
For this purpose, we are registered with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union [and Switzerland] to the United States. Additionally, we may also transfer personal data from the USA and EEA to our third-party hosting and IT service providers. For this purpose, we ensure that such parties have agreed EU-approved Standard Contractual Clauses with EC.
As detailed through this policy, EC adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles, namely Notice, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Choice, Security, Access, Recourse, Enforcement and Liability and Accountability for Onward Transfer. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.
INFORMATION SECURITY MEASURES. We have implemented appropriate organizational, technical, and administrative measures to protect Personal Data within our organization, including security controls to prevent unauthorized access to our systems. We also exercise care in facilitating the transmission of information between your device or computer and the third-party servers that operate and store information for the Site. Where necessary, we also enter into agreements with any third-party providers involved in hosting or storing personal data to ensure they meet similar security standards.
While we take reasonable steps to secure your Personal Data from loss, misuse, interference and unauthorized access, modification and disclosure, you should be aware no security procedures or protocols are ever guaranteed to be completely secure from intrusion or hacking, and there is therefore always some risk assumed by sharing Personal Data online. If you have reason to believe that your account has been compromised, please contact us at privacy@erincondren.com.
