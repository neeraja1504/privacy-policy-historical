We may receive information from third parties. For example, we may receive information about you from social networking websites, subject to their representation that they have a legal right to share such information with us.
When you provide information to third parties, even third parties you discover through the Services, your relationship with those third parties will be governed by their respective privacy policies and terms of service.

Without in any way limiting the above, below are some examples of how we share and disclose information:
Sponsors
We may engage third party sponsors to provide goods and/or services at the Festival, including, but not limited to, on-site activations, contests, sweepstakes and giveaways.  EZ reserves the right to share your Personal Information with sponsors that have on-site activations, contests, sweepstakes and/or giveaways. If your entry into any sponsored area, contest, sweepstakes, or giveaway at the Festival requires scanning your RFID wristband, you consent to sharing your Personal Information with that sponsor.  If you do not wish to have your Personal Information shared with a sponsor, do not scan your RFID wristband.
Users
Any information you choose to share on your profile page or in connection with the use of forums or message boards may be shared with EZ, other EZ users and third parties. It is your responsibility to maintain your anonymity and Personal Information, and we encourage you to think carefully about what Personal Information you disclose through these platforms.
Service Providers
We may employ third party companies and individuals and share your Personal Information and other data collected with those third party companies and individuals to facilitate or enhance our Services, to provide the Services on our behalf, to perform tasks (including, without limitation, maintenance services, database management, web analytics and improvement of our Services) or to assist us in analyzing how our Services are used.
Affiliate Service
When you access a website, or communicate with or use an application (mobile or otherwise) operated by any entity other than us (e.g., the iTunes App Store, a social networking site such as Facebook or Twitter, or one of our sponsors, venues or promoters) through our Services, the website or service is known as an Affiliate Service. We may, without your consent, share your Personal Information and other data collected about you with such Affiliate Services. Your use of the Affiliate Services is your choice, and you should be aware that our Affiliate Services may collect information about you. Accordingly, if you use an Affiliate Service, you should consult that Affiliate’s privacy policy before providing Personal Information. Some of our Affiliates may create “co-branded pages” or “powered by” pages for our Services. These might include pages that share our name and that of another entity. There may be a specific privacy policy on any such co-branded page. Any Personal Information that you provide when you sign up at any co-branded page may be collected by, or shared with, our third party Affiliate. Please see the Affiliate’s privacy policy to better understand what information is collected, how it is used and shared, and your choices regarding control.
Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement
We will disclose any information about you, without your consent, to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we in good faith believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including, but not limited to, subpoenas), to comply with applicable laws, to protect the property and rights of EZ, you or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to pose a risk of being, or is illegal, unethical or legally actionable.
Within our Company; Changes to our Company
We may share all or some of your Personal Information with any of our subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control to be used in a manner consistent with this Notice. Additionally, in the event we go through or undergo due dilligence in anticipation of a business transition such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your Personal Information may be among the assets transferred. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur and are permitted by this Notice, and that any entity that acquires such Personal Information by transfer may continue to process your Personal Information as set forth in this Notice.
Online Surveys/Sweepstakes and Contests. From time to time, we conduct online surveys and offer sweepstakes or contests on the Site (each, a “Promotion”), and we may collect Personal Information in connection with the same. By registering for a Promotion, you agree to allow EZ or third party services to collect your Personal Information and use that Personal Information, and any other data collected, to administer and analyze the Promotion. You should carefully review the rules, if any, of each Promotion in which you participate, as they may contain additional important information about the use of your Personal Information. To the extent that such rules conflict with this Notice, the Promotion rules will govern that particular Promotion.
Other Information and Ancillary Data Sets
Ancillary Data Sets are data sets derived from Personal Information or Other Information which do not contain any Personal Information.  Other Information and Ancillary Data Sets are EZ’s property, without restriction. ** **
Forums, Message Boards and Chats
We may make message boards, chat rooms, and other interactive forums available as Services. You should be aware that any information which you post to these interactive forums or otherwise choose to make publicly available, including your Personal Information, may be disclosed and available to all users who have access to that portion of the Service, and is no longer private and confidential.
You should be aware that any Personal Information you submit in the course of these public activities can be read, collected, or used by other users, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the Personal Information you choose to submit in these forums. If you post a video, image or photo for public view you should be aware that these may be viewed, collected, copied and/or used by other users without your consent.
By using these interactive forums, you agree that we are not responsible for any information that you disclose or communicate in such forums, and any disclosures you make are at your own risk. Please be thoughtful about what you post and make publicly available through the Services. We may maintain copies of any information you post indefinitely, or delete certain information in whole or in part if we determine, in our sole discretion, that such information constitutes an infringing or a prohibited posting as described in our Terms of Use, or for any or no reason. You are solely responsible for your interactions with others you interact with in our Services.
You understand and agree that we do not screen our users, nor do we inquire into the backgrounds or attempt to verify the statements of our users, except as provided for herein with respect to children less than thirteen (13) years of age. You agree to take reasonable precautions in all interactions with other users of our Services. You should not provide financial information (for example, your credit card information or bank account information) to other users of our Services.
EZ may use the information collected in connection with your profile page and use of the forums or message boards to update our databases or to contact you about any content you may have posted. Posting content that references any of EZ’s official accounts or Services on any other third party services or social media platforms may allow us to receive Personal Information about you from such third party services or social media platforms. In such cases, please refer to the privacy policy or Notice of the third party service or social media platforms for more information.
IF YOU ARE A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT UNDER THE AGE OF 18, DO NOT SHARE ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION ON ANY FORUM OR MESSAGE BOARD.  If you do post any Personal Information, you can remove it using Services functionality.  This removal may not be complete given the nature of the Internet.  Contact us at info@electriczoofestival.com for asistance.
Children’s Information
The Services are not directed to, or intended for, children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Information from individuals under 13 years of age. No one under the age of 13 may provide any Personal Information through our Services. For the avoidance of doubt, if you are under 13 years of age, you should not register or provide Personal Information through our Services. If we later obtain actual knowledge that a user is under 13 years of age, we will take steps to remove that user’s Personal Information from our systems. If you are the parent or guardian of a child whom you believe has disclosed Personal Information to us, please contact us at info@electriczoofestival.com so that we may delete and remove such child’s information from our systems.
We strongly recommend that minors 13 years of age or older ask their parents for permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet and we encourage parents to teach their children about safe Internet use practices.
Social Media and Online Engagement
We use a variety of new technologies and social media options to communicate and interact with our users, including popular social networking and media websites, open source software communities and more. To better engage the public in ongoing dialog, we use several third-party platforms including, but not limited to, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, SnapChat, Instagram, Disqus, Wufoo and Olapic. “Third-Party Websites and Applications” are web-based technologies that are not exclusively operated or controlled by us. When interacting with the EZ presence on those websites, you may reveal certain Personal Information to us or to third parties, which are subject to their own privacy policies.  If your use of any social media platform, plugin, API, or feature references EZ in any way, we reserve the right to share, repost, or otherwise collect such information as permitted by the terms of use governing the service on which EZ was referenced on.
Other Third Party Links
The Services may link to websites operated by third parties that we do not control, including the Third Party Websites and Applications described above. This includes any websites that you linked to from advertisements that appear on the Site. We do not monitor, control, or endorse the information collection or privacy practices of any third parties. We encourage you to become familiar with the privacy practices of each website you visit and to contact them if you have any questions about their respective privacy policies and practices. This Notice applies solely to information collected by us through our Services and does not apply to these third party websites. The ability to access information of third parties from our Services, or links to other websites or locations, is for your convenience only and does not signify our endorsement of such third parties, their products, services, websites, locations or their content.
Ad Networks and Third Party Cookies
We may have agreements with companies, sometimes called “Ad Networks” that advertise through our Services on behalf of third parties. These Ad Networks may place or recognize a “third party cookie,” on your browser. Ad Networks use cookies to understand the Web usage patterns of people who see advertisements, to control the sequence of advertisements you see, to provide you with the most relevant advertising, and to make sure you do not see the same ad too many times. Ad Networks may connect information about pages you visit through our Services with information about pages you visit on other sites and show you advertising based on this combined information. We do not control Ad Networks or what they do with the information they collect.
Network Advertising Initiative _  _
Many Ad Networks participate in the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and abide by NAI principles, which prohibit members from connecting Personal Information to information they collect through cookies without your explicit consent. If you wish to opt-out of participating in advertising programs conducted by NAI member Ad Networks, please go to the following NAI Opt-Out website and follow the instructions: www.networkadvertising.org/choices. After you opt-out, you will still see advertisements from NAI member Ad Networks, but the advertising will not be tailored to your web preferences and usage patterns.  We believe users should be informed about online advertising technologies and have the ability to choose whether they receive ads targeted to their interests.
