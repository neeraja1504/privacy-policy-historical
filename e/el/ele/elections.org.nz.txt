The Electoral Commission is currently using Google Analytics to help analyse how users use our sites.
This analytical tool uses 'cookies', which are text files placed on your computer, to collect standard internet log information and visitor behaviour information in an anonymous form. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including your computer's internet address or IP address) is transmitted to and stored by Google outside of New Zealand. The tracking data is stored in a database managed by Google. The tracking data is then used by Google to compile statistical reports on website activity for the Electoral Commission to evaluate site use. This allows us to:

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies by modifying the settings on your browser. Disabling cookies will not affect your ability to use the Electoral Commission's websites.
Email
Your email address will be collected if you consent to updating your enrolment details electronically with the Electoral Commission. This is collected for electoral purposes and we will not disclose your email address to third parties. The email address you supply, however, may be used to communicate with you regarding updates to your enrolment or our online services.
While we have in place a variety of security measures it is important to remember that email is not secure.  We cannot guarantee the privacy or confidentiality of any information that is sent over the Internet by email.  In accessing and using the Elections website, you accept that electronic mail passing over the Internet may not be free from interception or interference by third parties.
What happens to the information I supply by enrolling?
When you enrol, we will publish your name, the address where you reside, and your occupation in the roll of your electorate. The roll is a list of voters which any member of the public can look at and is used on election day for voting. We may give this information to scientific or health researchers, political candidates, members of Parliament or political parties. We can also tell them your age group, postal address and whether you are of Maori descent. The information is also used to make up lists of people who might be called to serve on a jury.
Is there any way to stop the information being published?
Yes. If you think you, or your family's personal safety could be at risk because information about you is published in the roll, you can ask to have details put on the unpublished roll. This cannot be looked at by members of the public. However, before we put your details in an unpublished roll, you will need to show us that you or your family's safety could be put at risk. Find out more about the unpublished roll.
Access to information
You have the right to ask for access to information held about you by the Registrar of Electors. You may also ask for this information to be corrected.
Checking the information
We may carry out information matching with details from a number of government agencies (under authorised information matching programmes) to ensure that the electoral roll is complete and correct.
If you have an enquiry or concern about our privacy policy, please contact: webmaster@elections.org.nz
