**BEHAVIORAL ADVERTISING  **
Our Websites use Cookies to determine whether a user has previously visited our Site to streamline the registration process.  Although we don’t use Cookies for other purposes, we and our third-party marketing partners and Related Parties reserve the right to use Cookies to track users’ online behavior after they leave a Website, and to collect Information that enables the tailoring of targeted offers and advertisements (to find out more about Cookies, please visit www.cookiecentral.com). We may share this and other Information with our third-party marketing partners, who may compensate us, and Related Parties.  We are not responsible for the Information collected by our third-party marketing partners and Related Parties, for their use of this Information or for the privacy practices of other websites that are linked to our Websites.
Most computers are initially set up to accept Cookies, but you can reset your Internet browser to refuse all Cookies or to indicate when a Cookie is being sent.  To disable and reject certain Cookies, follow the instructions associated with the Internet browser you’re using.  Even where you reject a Cookie, you may still use the Website but your ability to use certain features offerings may be impaired.  We may retain Cookie data indefinitely.
WELLNESS INFORMATION
Our surveys may ask health-related questions which we may share with our third-party marketing partners who advertise health-related products and services on our Websites or who otherwise promote health-related products or services. We will use this health information only with your consent and to display offers for health-related products and services or to provide Information to these providers so they can contact you.  You may always request modification or suppression of your information by contacting us here. You may also opt-out from future communications from a third-party by contacting them directly.  A third party’s use of Information is subject to their privacy policy and we have no control or responsibility over their use.
Users may opt-out from the collection of online viewing data for behavioral advertising purposes by companies who have elected to participate in one of the behavioral advertising opt-out mechanisms such as the Digital Adverting Alliance’s opt-out program located at http://www.aboutads.info/choices.  As is the case with most websites, we have currently elected to not participate in any of these programs or alter our behavior when a user to one of our Websites has activated the “do-not-track” setting on their browser (see, “Browser “Do Not Track” Signals,” described below).

We ask individual users to identify themselves and the Information requested to be accessed, corrected or deleted (suppressed) before processing such requests, and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning Information residing on backup tapes).Please be advised that deleting (suppressing) your Information may terminate your access to some of our offerings.  If you wish to continue using the full complement of our services, you may not be able to delete (suppress) all of the Information that we have on file for you.
YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS
The California “Shine the Light” law permits users who are California residents to request information regarding our disclosure of their Information to third parties including the categories of Information shared and a list of the names and addresses of third parties with whom the Information was shared.  If you are a California resident and would like a copy of this notice, please submit a request by contacting us here.  In your request, please specify that you want "Your RewardZoneUSA LLC California Privacy Rights Notice."  Please allow thirty (30) days for a response.
BROWSER “DO NOT TRACK” SIGNALS
Most browsers contain a “do-not-track” setting.  In general, when a “do-not-track” setting is active, the user’s browser notifies other websites that the user does not want their personal information and online behavior to be tracked and used, for example, for behavioral advertising.  As required by the Shine the Light law, we are required to inform you that, as is the case with most websites, we do not honor or alter our behavior when a user to one of our Websites has activated the “do-not-track” setting on his/her browser.
CHANGES TO THIS POLICY
We reserve the right to revise and update this Policy at any time.  If we make material changes to this Policy, we will post notice on our Website.  Any such revisions will be effective thirty (30) days after posting to the Website, and will apply to all Information collected by us both before and following the effective date.  If we expand the way we use PII, we will notify users by: (a) sending the modified policy to our users via email; and/or (b) by any other reasonable means acceptable under applicable state and federal law.  You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your PII in this different manner and we will only use your PII in this way where you opt-in to such use.  Users should periodically visit this Policy to review our current policies on our collection and use of Information.
