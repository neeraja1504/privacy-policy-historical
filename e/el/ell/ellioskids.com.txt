6. Gathering Information with Cookies
Cookies are used minimally on the Website. “Cookies” are small data files that are sent to your browser and then are placed on an individual visitor’s computer hard drive by a web server. Currently, with respect to the Website the 'Session ID' is the only thing stored in a cookie on a visitor’s computer. The purpose of this is to identify the user to the server while the visitor is browsing the Website. This function is not permanent; it only is valid while the visitor is on the Website. It will expire if the user jumps to another site and does come back in a short period of time, approximately 30 minutes. No information about the visitor, the visitor’s computer, or the visitor’s environment is saved by the Website in any way. If you do not want to accept cookies, you will often be able to prevent them from operating by changing your Internet browser settings. The “help” portion of the toolbar on most browsers will provide you with further information in this respect.
