THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT
Ellie Mae collects information from Website visitors and users of our products and services in a variety of manners, and also obtains information from third parties (including our customers’ borrowers and from service providers) in the course of providing our Services to customers. This information includes:
Information You Provide in Sales Inquiries. When you request information through the Website, we ask you to provide your name, title, company, address, email and telephone number. If you choose to contact us through the contact information available through the“Contact Us”link on the Website, we will collect your email address or your telephone number, the ClientID associated with your account, if any, and other identifying information you may provide.
Registration Information. When you register to use one of Ellie Mae’s products or services, we may collect certain information from you, including your name, email address, and other information that we use to contact you or provide services to you.
Usage Information. Like most online services, we collect standard technical, information when you use our Services, including, but not limited to unique device identifiers, internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser types, internet service providers (ISPs), the number and duration of page visits and the number of clicks.
Cookies and Other Technologies. We collect certain information through the use of “cookies” (also called “HTTP cookies” or “browser cookies”) and other tracking technologies. Cookies are small files that your browser places on your computer. We may use session cookies, persistent cookies, and other tracking technologies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor usage by our users and web traffic routing on our services, and to improve and personalize our Services. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting cookies from the websites you visit. Google provides some additional privacy options relating to Google analytics, described at www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/. We may also use web beacons, which are transparent graphic images on a webpage or within the body of one of our marketing emails, to allow us to measure visitor actions and assess the effectiveness of our Services or email marketing campaigns. For example, we use web beacons in our email marketing to track instances where a user clicks through a link in the email.
Borrower Information. In the course of delivering our hosted products and services—including Encompass, Encompass Product & Pricing Service, CenterWise, WebCenter, TPO WebCenter, Mavent/Encompass Compliance Service, the Ellie Mae Network, Consumer Direct, Encompass Document Management, and Encompass CRM—we receive information about our customers’ borrowers (which may include personal information), which is provided by our customers. In some instances we collect information directly from our customers’ borrowers, such as when we provide our WebCenter, Consumer Direct, Encompass CRM or Encompass Product & Pricing Services to our customers. We process this information on the behalf of our customers. Our customers are responsible for providing notice and obtaining appropriate consents to collect data from their borrowers and to provide it to us as their service provider.
Transactional Information. Ellie Mae may also create transactional records of each of the transactions or other events occurring through our Services. This transactional information is generally collected for the purpose of loan document creation, origination, management, and distribution, to enable Ellie Mae to provide its Services, to enable the services provided by third parties (including determinations of qualification for loans or the interest rates to be applied to loans), and to enable Ellie Mae to comply with various legal obligations.
Messaging Services and Other Communications. Ellie Mae enables users of certain Services to communicate with each other through those Services using messaging services like chat or email. We collect and process this information to enable our customers to communicate and collaborate.
Information from Appraisal Center, Title Center and Loan Center Users. If you are a service provider that wishes to transact with other Ellie Mae customers, you may use segments of our Services designed for service providers, such as Appraisal Center, Title Center, or Loan Center. When you register or log in at one of these service center homepages, we collect and process some information in addition to what is described in this Privacy Policy. At each of these product or service homepages, you may log in or register to view requests for your services sent by Encompass users. When you log in or register, we collect your login ID and password to ascertain your identity and display the proper orders to you. Either when you register or during the course of your subscription to our Services, we may also collect credit card information you input or share for billing purposes. If you choose to create a marketing page for others to view within Encompass, we will store the information you provide for that page on our servers to enable Encompass users to access and view your page.
Information from the Ellie Mae Network. Within the “Services” menu of Encompass, you are able to order various services from our partners, such as credit reports, appraisals and title services through the Ellie Mae Network (formerly the ePASS® system). These services include offerings from both partners who have signed up with Ellie Mae directly and business contacts of yours that you have chosen to import into Encompass. If you select a provider and place an order, we may collect (and share with the provider) the relevant information about the loan, property, borrower or credit report directly into the order dialog (the “Input Data”). The order form containing Input Data will automatically be populated with your company’s name, address, phone number and the name of the user acting as the contact for the order (“Company Information”). You may also input a unique account or user ID, username and/or password for some service providers with whom you have registered (“Login Information”). We share your Input Data, Company Information, and Login information with the provider. If you opt to pay for the service with a credit card, we will collect and share your payment information with the provider. If you click on a provider’s product or service, we may share that information with the provider in order to help them provide you with relevant offers and information, and so that we may assess the effectiveness of our internal marketing campaigns. You can opt-out of this sharing of your information through Encompass Settings. If you select a service provider who is not directly connected to Encompass, you will be directed to log into or otherwise access that provider’s third party site to complete your order. In this circumstance, the privacy policy and terms of service presented on the third party website will apply to your transactions, and Ellie Mae has no control over or responsibility for the information sent or other communications between you and the third party provider.
