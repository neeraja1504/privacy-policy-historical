DATA COLLECTION POLICY
Collection of Information
Aggregate Data: You may visit web pages within the Elliott Wave Network of websites referenced above without giving us any personally identifiable information (PII) about yourself. We do collect aggregate (non-PII) data such as browser type, connection speed, previously viewed products on our site, click paths, etc. about users using cookies (See the "Tracking Cookies" section below). Any data we obtain automatically using these tracking technologies is used to enhance the website experience such as exposing visitors to other relevant services that we feel could be complementary. We also use this data for analytic trend studies. You will be notified when your personally identifiable information is collected by any third party that is not our agent/service provider, so you can make an informed choice as to whether or not to share your information with that party. We do not link aggregate user data with personally identifiable information.
Personally Identifiable Information: In order to deliver services you've requested and personalize your experience with the Elliott Wave Network of websites referenced above further, we may ask for you to give personally identifiable information (PII ) such as your name, postal address, email address, phone number, interests or preferences, IP address, credit card number, etc. We are committed to protecting all of the personally identifiable information that we collect and thus this information is kept strictly confidential and is not distributed to third parties who are not service providers or as described in this privacy statement without your consent.
We store the information that we collect through cookies and clear gif images to create a "profile" of your preferences. We then tie your personally identifiable information (such as your name, email address, and interests or preferences), and your purchasing history, to information in your customer profile, in order to provide tailored promotions and marketing offers and to enhance your website experience.
We may request personally identifiable information when you:
Sign up for one of our free content programs such as Club EWI, Free Email Newsletters, or our Affiliate Program

In order to comply with the Federal CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, we may provide a list of email addresses of customers who have opted-out of EWI's email lists to other companies that send email on our behalf (Email Service Providers). This suppression list is used solely for the purpose of preventing an unsubscribed EWI customer from receiving EWI-related emails from another company. We require all companies that send to their email lists on our behalf to sign an agreement prohibiting the suppression list from being used for any other purpose than not sending you our email. We conform to all state and federal laws regarding this issue.
