How do we protect information about children?

All such information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons and contractors who have special access rights to such systems. All contractors have agreed to keep this information confidential.
How can parents review their child's personal information and prevent its use or disclosure?
A parent or guardian who permits personal information to be collected about their child may also submit a signed written request to review or modify the information about their child. We will delete personal information about a child upon receipt of a written request from the parent or guardian who initially submitted such information. In the event of such a request, we will retain only information necessary for record keeping and customer service for past transactions.
