Security of Personal Data
Ellucian is committed to safeguarding the Personal Data that it receives. While Ellucian cannot guarantee the security of Personal Data, Ellucian has implemented reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect Personal Data in Ellucian’s possession from loss, misappropriation and unauthorized access, disclosure and destruction.
Ellucian utilizes a combination of online and offline security technologies, procedures and organizational measures to help safeguard Personal Data. For example, facility security is designed to prevent unauthorized access to Ellucian computers. Electronic security measures — including, for example, network access controls, passwords and access logging — provide protection from hacking and other unauthorized access. Ellucian also protects Personal Data through the use of firewalls, role-based restrictions and, where appropriate, encryption technology. Ellucian limits access to Personal Data to employees, subcontractors, and third-party agents that have a specific business reason for accessing such Personal Data. Individuals who have been granted access to Personal Data will be made aware of their responsibilities to protect such information and will be provided training and instruction on how to do so.
If Ellucian learns of an unauthorized disclosure of Personal Data that is within Ellucian’s possession or control, Ellucian will perform all actions required by applicable laws, including taking prompt measures to remedy the unauthorized disclosure and providing required notices.
Ellucian hires other companies to provide certain services on our behalf; for example, to process event registrations. Ellucian will provide these companies only with the information they need to deliver the services, and they are contractually prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.
Because Ellucian is a global company, Personal Data may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Ellucian and its affiliates and agents maintain facilities or personnel.
Ellucian’s products and services are not intended for children under the age of 13. Ellucian does not knowingly collect any information from children. If we learn that we have collected or received Personal Data from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information.
Under certain circumstances, we may be required to disclose your Personal Data in response to valid requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Statement and the Privacy Shield, the Privacy Shield shall govern.
Ellucian will only process EEA or Swiss Data in ways that are compatible with the purpose for which Ellucian collected the EEA or Swiss Data, or for purposes that the individual or entity providing the EEA or Swiss Data later authorizes. Before we use your EEA or Swiss Data for a purpose that is materially different than the purpose for which it was collected or that you later authorized, we will provide you with the opportunity to opt out.

We may request specific information from you to confirm your identity. In some circumstances we may charge a reasonable fee for access to your information.
