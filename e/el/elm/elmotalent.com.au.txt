DATA PRIVACY & PROTECTION POLICY
POLICY
This Data Privacy & Protection Policy applies to ELMO Software Limited’s Cloud HR & Payroll applications and platform
(collectively, the “Services”), elmosoftware.com.au and other ELMO websites (collectively, the “Websites”) and other
interactions (e.g., customer service inquiries, user conferences, etc.) you may have with ELMO Software Limited and its
subsidiaries.
This Data Privacy & Protection Policy does not apply to any third party applications or software that integrate with the
Services through the ELMO Software Limited platform (“Third Party Services”), or any other third party products, services
or businesses. In addition, a separate agreement governs delivery, access and use of the Services (the “Software as a
Service Agreement”), including the processing of any messages, files or other content submitted through Services
accounts (collectively, “Customer Data”).
The organisation (e.g., your employer or another entity or person) that entered into the Software as a Service Agreement
(“Customer”) controls their instance of the Services and any associated Customer Data. If you have any questions about
specific settings and privacy practices, please contact the Customer who has provided you with access to the ELMO
INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND RECEIVE
ELMO Software may collect and receive Customer Data and other information and data (“Other Information”) in a variety
of ways:
    Customer Data. Customers or individuals granted access to ELMO Cloud HR and Payroll software services
(“Services”) by a Customer (“Authorised User”) routinely submit Customer Data to ELMO Software Limited when
using the Services.
    Other Information. ELMO Software Limited also collects, generates and/or receives Other Information:
I.    Usage Information.
 Services Metadata. When an Authorised User interacts with the Services, metadata is
generated that provides additional context about the way Authorised Users work. For example,
ELMO Software logs the features, content and links you interact with, and activity logs for all
actions (e.g. assignment, modification, edit, copy, delete) taken by Authorised users when
interacting with the Services
 Log data. As with most websites and technology services delivered over the Internet, our
servers automatically collect information when you access or use our Websites or Services and
record it in log files. This log data may include the Internet Protocol (IP) address, the address of
the web page visited before using the Website or Services, browser type and settings, the date
and time the Services were used, information about browser configuration and plugins,
language preferences and cookie data.
 Device information. ELMO Software Limited collects information about devices accessing the
Services, including type of device, what operating system is used, device settings, application
IDs, unique device identifiers and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this Other
Information often depends on the type of device used and its settings.
 Location information. We receive information from you, your Customer and other third-parties
that helps us approximate your location. We may, for example, use a business address
submitted by your employer, or an IP address received from your browser or device to
determine approximate location.
II.    Cookie Information. ELMO Software Limited uses cookies and similar technologies in our Websites and
Services that help us collect Other Information. The Websites and Services may also include cookies and
similar tracking technologies of third parties, which may collect Other Information about you via the
Websites and Services and across other websites and online services.
III.    Third Party Data. ELMO Software Limited may receive data about organisations, industries, Website
visitors, marketing campaigns and other matters related to our business from parent corporation(s),
affiliates and subsidiaries, our partners or others that we use to make our own information better or
more useful. This data may be combined with Other Information we collect and might include aggregate
level data, such as which IP addresses correspond to zip codes or countries. Or it might be more specific:
for example, how well an online marketing or email campaign performed.

Generally, no one is under a statutory or contractual obligation to provide any Customer Data or Other Information
(collectively, “Information”). However, certain Information is collected automatically and, if some Information, such as

Websites and business. More specifically, ELMO Software Limited uses Other Information:

models, identify organisational trends and insights, to customise a Services experience or create new features or
improvements or develop new products.

messages and other types of communications. We may also contact you to inform you about changes in our
Services, our Services offerings, and important Services-related notices, such as security and fraud notices. These
communications are considered part of the Services and you may not opt out of them. In addition, we sometimes
send emails about new product features, promotional communications or other news about ELMO Software
Limited. These are marketing messages so you can control whether you receive them.

you for invoicing, account management and similar reasons and we use account data to administer accounts and
keep track of billing and payments.
   To investigate and help prevent security issues and abuse.

natural person, ELMO Software Limited may use it for any business purpose. To the extent Information is associated with
an identified or identifiable natural person and is protected as personal data under applicable data protection law, it is
referred to in this Data Privacy & Protection Policy as “Personal Data.”
