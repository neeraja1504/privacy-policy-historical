We may share your Personal Data with any of our corporate affiliates or subsidiaries, if any, for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy.
Agents, Consultants and Third Party Service Providers:
Elfster, like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples of such functions include mailing information, maintaining databases and processing payments. When we employ another entity to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function, and we ensure that they are obligated to keep such information confidential.
Legal Requirements:
Elfster may disclose your Personal Data or other information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of Elfster, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Site, the Services or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability.
Your Choices:
You can visit the Site without providing any Personal Data. If you choose not to provide any Personal Data, you may not be able to use certain Services.
Children and Minors:
Elfster does not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any Personal Data through the Services. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Data on the Site or through the Services without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Data to Elfster through the Site or the Services, please contact us, and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.
Links to Other Web Sites:
The Site may have links to third-party websites not operated or controlled by Elfster, which may have privacy policies that differ from our own. We are not responsible for the practices of such sites, nor does any such link imply that Elfster endorses or has reviewed the third party site subject to such link.  The policies and procedures we described here do not apply to the Third Party Sites. We suggest contacting those sites directly for information on their privacy policies.
Integrating Social Networking Services:
One of the special features of our Site and Service is that you may log in via various social networking services like Facebook or Twitter (“Social Networking Services”). By directly integrating these services, we make your online experiences richer and more personalized. To take advantage of this feature, we will ask you to log into or grant us permission to access certain of your information via the relevant Social Networking Service. When you add a Social Networking Services account to the Service or log into the Service using your Social Networking Services account, we will collect relevant information necessary to enable the Service to access that Social Networking Service and your data contained within that Social Networking Service. As part of such integration, the Social Networking Service will provide us with access to certain information that you have provided to the Social Networking Service, and we will use, store and disclose such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. However, please remember that the manner in which Social Networking Services use, store and disclose your information is governed by the policies of each such Social Networking Service, and Elfster shall have no liability or responsibility for the privacy practices or other actions of any Social Networking Services that may be enabled within our Site or our Services.
You may also have the option of posting your Site or Services activities to Social Networking Services when you access content through the Site or the Services (for example, you may post to Facebook that you performed an activity on the Service); you acknowledge that if you choose to use this feature, your friends, followers and subscribers on any Social Networking Services you have enabled will be able to view such activity.
Data Security:
Elfster takes reasonable steps to protect the Personal Data and other information that you provide to us via the Site and the Services from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error free. Therefore, you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us via email. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any Personal Data to Elfster via the Internet.
