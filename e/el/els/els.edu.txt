ELS Educational Services Privacy Policy - ELS
At Berlitz, we respect our customers and understand that you are concerned about privacy. Therefore, Berlitz Languages, Inc. and its affiliates (collectively, ”Berlitz”) have posted this Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) to let you know what kind of information we collect, how it is handled, and with whom it may be shared.
As we continue to develop our websites, including, without limitation, any website or URL of ours that we have linked to this Policy (collectively “websites”), and take advantage of technologies to improve the services we offer, this Policy will likely change. We encourage you to refer to this Policy on an ongoing basis, so that you understand our current Policy.
If you are a past or present employee of Berlitz who is based in the European Union or European Economic Area, please see the section below on “Information Received from the European Union or European Economic Area.”
What Information Do We Collect?
Personal Information
We collect various types of “personal information” depending upon how you use our websites, such as:
When you order from us, we collect your name, address, email address, phone number, and credit card number with expiration date.
When you order from us, we may retain a record of your account and purchase information.
When you enter a sweepstakes or contest online, we usually collect your name, address, email address, and phone number. We also may ask you for additional information, such as your age, interests, product preferences, or zip code.
When you submit an inquiry, we need your name, email address and zip code to respond.
If you do choose to give us personal information through our websites, we will collect and retain that information, and you consent to the transfer and storage of that information on our servers. We will retain your personal information as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or not prohibited by law.
Non-Personal Information
When you use our websites, we may also collect "non-personal information," which is information that, by itself, cannot be used to identify or contact you, such as demographic information (such as your age, gender, income, education, profession, zip code, etc.) or technical information (such as your IP address, the type of browser you are using). Non-personal information may also include information that you provide us through your use of our websites, such as the terms you enter into the search functions of our websites.
Cookies and Similar Technologies
When you visit or interact with our websites or services, we or our authorized service providers may use cookies, clear gifs, log files, flash cookies and similar technologies for the functioning of our services, to help us improve our performance, or to give you extra functionalities, all with the goal of providing a better experience.
The common types of tracking technologies (collectively “cookies and similar technologies”) used by Berlitz include:
Cookies: A small piece of information sent by a website that is saved in the memory of your computer's browser or device. It holds information a site may need to interact with you and personalize your experience. At Berlitz, we use two kinds of cookies: session cookies and persistent cookies.
Session cookies exist only for as long as you stay on Berlitz’ websites or your browser remains open. Once you exit your browser or leave Berlitz’ websites, they go away. We use session cookies to maintain information we need to have in order for you to shop at our websites. For example, the Session ID cookie that we ask your browser to hold retains the ID for your shopping bag. Without the Session ID cookie, you can't add merchandise to your bag and carry it to Checkout.
Persistent cookies last from visit to visit. They are stored in your browser’s cache or device until you choose to delete them. We may use persistent cookies to give you a more personalized shopping experience and to help you navigate our site more efficiently.
Cookies can be used by a website to recognize you. But that does not necessarily mean any personal information is stored in the cookies. At Berlitz, we store no personal information about you in the cookies. Anything you choose to tell us about yourself (such as your address and email address) is stored on our secured servers. Please visit www.allaboutcookies.org for more information about cookies and how to disable them.
Web beacons: Small graphic images (also known as "pixel tags" or "clear GIFs") that may be included on our websites, services, applications, or tools, that typically work in conjunction with cookies to identify our users and user behavior.
Similar technologies: Technologies that store information in your browser or device utilizing local shared objects or local storage, such as flash cookies, HTML 5 cookies, and other web application software methods. These technologies can operate across all of your browsers, and in some instances may not be fully managed by your browser and may require management directly through your installed applications or device. We do not use these technologies for storing information to target advertising to you on or off our websites.
Use of Cookies and Similar Technologies by Authorized Third-Party Service Providers
We may work with third-party companies, commonly known as service providers, who are authorized to place cookies and similar technologies on our websites with our permission. These service providers help us to provide you with a better, faster, and safer experience.
These service providers may use cookies and similar technologies to help us deliver our own content and advertising, and compile anonymous site metrics and analytics. We do not authorize any of these service providers to collect any of your personal information on our websites for their own purposes. Third-party cookies and similar technologies are covered by the third parties' privacy policies.
Do Not Track
Berlitz currently does not respond to Do Not Track signals in browsers. While we collect personal information from you as described earlier in this Policy, we do not collect personal information from you to monitor your online activities across third-party websites or online services (also known as behavioral advertising or interest-based advertising).
Third parties that have content embedded on Berlitz’ websites (such as buttons, widgets, and other embedded features or content) may set cookies on a user’s browser and/or obtain information about the fact that you visited our websites from a certain IP address. We do not authorize third parties to collect any other personal information from Berlitz’ websites unless you provide it to them directly.
How Do We Use Your Information?

If you choose to provide personal information to us, we may use your information in a number of ways, including the following:

To enhance your online experience. For example, we may use it to recognize you and welcome you to our websites.
To send you offers and information about our websites, or products, services, and events offered by us or one of our Affiliates, including for marketing and promotional purposes (as permitted by law).

How Do We Share Your Information?
Affiliated Parties
Except as specifically set forth in this Policy, we do not share your personal information with any non-affiliated third party without your permission. We may disclose aggregate information, such as demographic information, and our statistical analyses to third parties, including advertisers or other business partners. This aggregate information does not include your personal information. We may, however, share your personal information with certain entities that control us, are controlled by us, or are under common control with us (our "Affiliates"), and websites operated by our Affiliates, so that they and we can offer you products and services that may be of interest to you. This includes the transfer of your personal information to Berlitz’ parent company located in the United States.  We require that our Affiliates agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.  As of March 28, 2018, these Affiliates include the following entities:

Service Providers and Third Parties
We may team with a marketing agency or another website to conduct a sweepstakes or other event. In this case, each of the participating third parties may collect or receive personal information from you if you provide information directly to them. Therefore, you should refer to their privacy policies to understand how they handle your information and what kinds of choices you have.
Berlitz may also share your personal information with outside companies that perform services for Berlitz. For example, we may retain an outside company to manage a database containing certain customer information or to create and distribute an email offering. When we work with an outside party, we require that these parties agree to process your personal information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Policy. We will take appropriate steps designed to ensure your information will be used solely to provide the services requested by us, and not for other purposes.
Other Disclosures
Additionally, Berlitz may share your personal information when it is necessary to comply with law or to protect our interests or property. This may include sharing your personal information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or in order to investigate or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, Terms of Use violations, or as otherwise required by law.
Is My Information Secure?
Berlitz is committed to doing its best to maintain the security of information collected on our websites. To try to prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have implemented physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect.
There is always some risk in transmitting information electronically. As we deem appropriate, we use security measures consistent with industry standards. However, we cannot guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that information you supply won't be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet.
Access and Corrections

It is not technologically possible to change or delete each and every instance of the information we hold on you from our systems, and data may remain in non-erasable or aggregate form. We may retain data for a period in our backup or temporary systems. We may also retain some information for longer periods as required by law, contract, or auditing requirements.
What About Children's Privacy?
It currently is our policy not to knowingly collect personal information from any person under the age of 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with personal information without their consent, he or she should contact us at rita.pauls@berlitz.de.

Upon receipt of a fully completed removal request, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to remove content posted by you from our websites. Any such request does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of your posted content.

Additionally, while Berlitz will remove the content you posted from our websites, it may continue to be stored on our servers (although it will not be visible to other users of our websites).

Non-U.S. Residents
If you are located outside the U.S., please note that you may be transferring your personal information to a country that does not have the same data protection laws as your home country.  For personal information received from the European Union, European Economic Area, or Switzerland, Berlitz (including its Affiliates listed in the “Affiliated Parties” section above) is committed to handling your personal information in accordance with this Policy and the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield (or the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield, as the case may be), as administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce.

Berlitz’ accountability for personal information that it receives under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to a third party is described in the Privacy Shield Principles.

If you have any questions or comments about this Policy, please select your country and use the Contact form. Complaints will be resolved internally in accordance with Berlitz’ complaints procedures. If you live in the European Union, European Economic Area, or Switzerland and efforts to resolve the matter internally are unsatisfactory, the complaint may be submitted to the American Arbitration Association (http://www.adr.org), which has been selected as the independent recourse mechanism to resolve complaints and disputes relating to treatment of data originating in the European Union, European Economic Area, or Switzerland under this Policy. Berlitz is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
If you are a past or present employee of Berlitz in the European Union, European Economic Area, or Switzerland, Berlitz has also chosen to cooperate with and comply with the advice of EU data protection authorities (DPAs) in relation to such unresolved complaints (as further described in the Privacy Shield Principles).
