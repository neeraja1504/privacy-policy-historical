What This Privacy Policy Covers
This privacy policy relates to use of the Elgg.org web site at http://elgg.org/
This privacy policy covers how Elgg.org (hereafter named 'we') will treat personal information that we collect. Personal information is your information and includes identifiers like your name, address, email address, phone number.
We will not send you any junk emails. Furthermore we will not send you any information unless you have specifically requested we do so. An exception to this rule will be the initial email validation when you create a new account.
Children under 13 are not permitted to use the Elgg.org service, and so this privacy policy makes no provision for children's use of the site.
Changes to this Privacy Policy
Elgg.org may update this policy at any time for any reason. If there are any significant changes to how we handle personal information we will send a notice to the primary email address specified in your Elgg.org account or by placing a prominent notice on our site.
