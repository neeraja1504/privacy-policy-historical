Privacy Policy - EliteTrader.com
Information About You
We collect several types of information on our Site. We collect "Personal Information", which generally speaking is information that can be used to identify you individually, such as your name and address. We also collect "Non-personal Information", which is information about you that does not itself identify you individually. Examples of Non-personal Information include age range and gender. We also collect "Aggregate Information", which is information about use of our site, such as pages visited on our Site. The information we collect depends on what services you use on our Site. The following is a more detailed explanation of these types of information as well as when and how we collect and use it.

Registration and Transactional Data. When you register on our Site, we may collect and store information related to your account including user name and user password. When you make purchases from our Site, we may collect purchasing information such as product orders, shipping address(es), and credit card information.
Surveys
From time-to-time we may post surveys on our Site. The surveys may request demographic information (such as age range, gender, areas of interest, and familiarity with Elite Trader content, products and services) and customer feedback. Participation in these requests is completely voluntary and with each request you will have the choice of whether or not to disclose information. Such survey information will be used to improve the overall experience on EliteTrader.com.
Customer Service Correspondence
We may collect information that identifies you personally when you submit comments, questions or suggestions to our Customer Service department.
Interactivity

Any information you post in such forums is public information and Elite Trader cannot control what uses third parties may make of personal information you share in such forums.
Private Messaging
Your account will allow you to access our "Private Messaging" system. Although this system allows you to contact other members directly without your messages being publicly viewable by all site visitors, your private messages are openly accessible to Administrators of our site. Your private messages may be accessed at any time for the purposes of site administration, legal inquiries, or investigating your account for violations of our member conduct rules.

Use of Your Personal and Non-Personal Information Except as disclosed in this policy, we do not sell information that identifies our guests personally or makes it possible for other parties to contact them directly without our guests' consent. We may use, sell, disclose, or otherwise dispose of Personal Information we collect in the following circumstances:

Company Sale. Information collected through our Site is considered a trade secret of Elite Trader. As the owner of such information, we may disclose or sell such information as an asset of the company in conjunction with the sale to a third party of our company or a portion of our assets.
Aggregate Information
We collect Aggregate Information about you and your use of our Site whenever you visit us online. For instance, we may collect various forms of "click stream" information such as entry and exit points for our Site (i.e., referring URLs or domains), site traffic statistics, page views, impressions, and operating system and browser type. In addition, when users request pages on our Site, our servers may log their IP addresses. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web.
We also use third-party software that tracks traffic directed to EliteTrader.com from affiliate Web sites and the purchases that result from this traffic. This information is aggregated and is not tied to an individual purchase.
This Aggregate Information generally will not personally identify you or be correlated to you individually for external purposes. We may collect, compile, store, publish, promote, report, sell, or otherwise disclose or use any and all Aggregate Information, provided that, such information does not personally identify you. When we share such information with other companies, it is not traceable to any particular user, and will not be used to contact you. If we do correlate any Aggregate Information to you, such information will be treated like any other personal identifying information under this policy.
