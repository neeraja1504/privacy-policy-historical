Privacy Policy
Last Modified: May 21 st, 2018
Effective: May 25 th, 2018
This is the Privacy Policy for EliteDataScience.com (“Site” or “Website”), which is owned and operated by Challenger Media LLC (“Company” or “We” or “Us”). This policy also pertains to all of content, products, and courses (“Services”) on the site.
We are serious about protecting your online privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our views and practices concerning privacy, and how they may pertain to you as a user of our website.
First, we always follow these fundamental principles:
We try to keep the data we collect to a minimum. This philosophy is a win-win: it protects our users’ privacy and it simplifies our business processes. This has been our design principle from the beginning, and it will continue to guide our practices.
We try to keep the personal information we collect to a minimum. For example, to analyze our site and content’s performance, we rely on anonymous or aggregate data.
We try to make it as easy as possible to opt out of our email communications. There is an “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of each email. Again, this philosophy is a win-win: we only spend resources to communicate with users who agree to receive them.
We do not actively collect or store any sensitive information about you. We are NOT in the data collection business; we are in the business of creating world-class content and courses.
We never sell, lease, or otherwise share your information with anyone else, except for legal compliance purposes or when necessary for our business operations.
