elitepronet.com works with subcontractors, general contractors, homeowners and supplier. In order to make our
website more useful to our users, we collect personal information in a variety of ways, as outlined in this Privacy Policy. We
have designed this Privacy Policy, and our underlying procedures, to best protect users' private information while making
our website as useful and user friendly as possible. We endeavor to protect our users' private information to the greatest
extent possible, but we cannot promise, and users should not expect, that personal information or private communications
will always remain private. REGISTRATION OF SUBCONTRACTORS, GENERAL CONTRACTORS, HOMEOWNERS AND SUPPLIERS
In order to submit a project request or enroll as a subcontractor, a user must register with our website, including creating a
unique username and password. During the registration process, a user must provide contact information. We then use
this information to contact the user about services on our website for which they have expressed an interest. By submitting
a project request or enrolling as a subcontractor, a user expressly consents to being contacted by us by phone, email
address or mail. INFORMATION COLLECTED WHEN SUBMITTING PROJECTS
A project request includes the completion of a Submit Project Form and a Personal Profile Form. The Personal Profile Form
is used to register the user to our website and is only required during the first instance of a project request. At the Submit
Project Form we collect information that describes the scope of the project. We will also collect information relevant to the
project such as contact name, address, bid due date, email address, and relevant information about the project. INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM SUBCONTRACTORS
Subcontractors enroll in our service online and complete a Registration Form and agree to a Service Agreement. During the
registration we collect the following information: first and last name, company name, address, phone number, email
address, membership affiliations, trades, billing address, username, password, credit card number, expiration date. HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT:
The information collected is used to provide project information to qualified subcontractors within our network.
Enhancement of Marketing Profile
We may purchase third party marketing data and add it to our user database to target our advertising and provide pertinent
offers to our users. We use this information to enhance the profile of individual users, and it is tied to users' personally
identifiable information. This information is not collected directly from users, but from third party sources. User Profiles
We use users' personally identifiable information to facilitate their use of our services. We create a personalized profile for
each of our users by storing information we collect through a variety of mechanisms, which are explained below. This
profile includes information on our users' viewing preferences, activities on our website and interactions with
elitepronet.com. By analyzing our users' activities on our website and use of our services, we can improve our
services and our website.  DATA COLLECTION
Cookies:
A cookie is a very small file stored on the user's hard drive that identifies the user to our website and assists us in data
collection. We use both session cookies, which terminate when the user's browser is closed, and persistent cookies,
which must be manually deleted.
Session cookies allow our system to remember information about the user only during that internet browser session.
Persistent cookies allow our system to remember our users, meaning that they will not be required to log in every time that
they visit our website. Users may reject these cookies, or manually delete them. We do, however, offer several features only
available through the use of a cookie; users who have rejected our cookies may not be able to access these features.  Log Files:
We employ log files, which track certain information about your internet connection, including internet protocol addresses
and internet service provider type. These log files are not linked to personally identifiable information of any user. By tracking
this information, we are better able to analyze our users' needs and improve our services and website. INFORMATION ELITEPRONET SHARES Except as detailed in this Privacy Policy, EliteProNet does not share your information with third parties. The
information we collect is to facilitate our users' use of our website and services.
Aggregate Information: EliteProNet collects aggregate information on our users' use of our website, which we may share with third parties.
This information does not contain personally identifiable information. Rather, this information is an anonymous summary of
activities on our website. Legal Requirements:
Though we strive to preserve users' privacy, we cannot ensure that users' private communications and other personal
information will always remain confidential. For example, we may disclose personal information when required by law or
when we believe parties are misusing or attempting to misuse our websites or services. Security:
Users should also know that there is always a risk that third parties may unlawfully access private communications and
information. While we use several online and offline security tools, policies and procedures, we cannot guarantee security
of the information we collect or that unauthorized access will not occur. Third Parties:
Users of our website are always notified when their information is being collected for marketing purposes by any outside
parties, except our affiliates or service professionals. Sale, Merger or Acquisition:
In the event that EliteProNet goes through a merger, acquisition or asset sale, users' personal information will
likely be part of the assets transferred. COMMUNICATIONS FROM ELITEPRONET Opt-Out
Users may always "opt-out" of having their information used for most purposes. For example, users who no longer wish to
receive our newsletter and promotional communications may opt-out of receiving those communications by replying to the
e-mail or e-mailing us at support@elitespronet.com.
Notifications for Subcontractors Subcontractors in our network, or in our trial program, will receive regular communications from us regarding bid requests
we have received, or directly from our users. We may use any contact information we have for our service professionals to
provide such communications. Subcontractors may designate which method of communication they prefer on our website
or by contacting Customer Service at support@elitepronet.com. Promotional Communications
We send all new members an e-mail to verify usernames and passwords. Existing users will occasionally receive
information on our services, products and special deals as well. We offer all users the opportunity to opt-out of these
communications. Newsletter
We may provide our users with a newsletter about our services. If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for
contact information such as name and e-mail address. We also offer users the opportunity to opt-out of these types of
communications. Announcements
We may occasionally need to send out service-related announcements. Users may not opt-out of these communications,
though they may deactivate their account entirely. MANAGING PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION
Registered users can self-manage their personally identifiable information by means of logging into their secure and
password-protected "Dashboards." Changes made are immediately reflected throughout our system.
CONTACTING ELITEPRONET Changes in Personal Information
Users should e-mail Customer Support at support@elitepronet.com if their personal information changes or they
no longer desire our services. Contact Information
