SERVICE PROVIDERS.  We may share personal and anonymous information with agents, subsidiaries, affiliates, partners and other third parties that perform functions on our behalf, such as hosting, billing, content management tools, analytics, customer service, fraud protection, etc.  These entities have access to the Personal Information needed to perform their functions and are obligated to maintain the confidentiality and security of that Personal Information.  The Service Providers are restricted from using, selling, distributing or altering this data in any way other than to provide the requested services.

WHAT STEPS DO WE TAKE TO KEEP PERSONAL INFORMATION SECURE
The security of your Personal Information is important to us.  Personal Information collected by the Site is stored in operating environments that are not available to the public.  Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we disclose your Personal Information to you. In certain telephone and in person transactions we may ask for your full Social Security number, account number or other information to verify your identity before conducting the transactions you have requested.  Note that Elavon will never initiate a request via email for your sensitive information (e.g., Social Security number, personal ID, password, PIN or account number).  If you receive an email asking for your sensitive information, you should be suspicious of the request and promptly contact us to report the suspicious activity.   Please understand, however, that while we try our best to safeguard your Personal Information once we receive it, no transmission of data over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  We review our security procedures to consider appropriate technology and methods to secure information.
WHAT ARE YOUR OBLIGATIONS IN USING THE SITE
When using the Site, you promise to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself and your business, and (b) maintain and promptly update the registration information to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or Elavon has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, Elavon has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Site (or any portion thereof).  You are entirely responsible for the security and confidentiality of your password and account. Furthermore, you are entirely responsible for any and all activities that occur under your account.

We attempt to protect the Personal Information of all users of the Site and we attempt to comply with local data protection and consumer rights laws to the extent they may apply to the Elavon services, but the Site is targeted to United States of America citizens and our policies are directed at compliance with those laws.  If you are uncertain whether this Privacy Policy conflicts with the applicable local privacy laws where you are located, you should not submit your Personal Information to Elavon.
