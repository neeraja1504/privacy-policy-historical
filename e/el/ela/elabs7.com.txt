Our Web site includes Widgets, which are interactive mini-programs that run on our site to provide specific services from another company ( e.g. displaying the news, opinions, music, etc ).   Personal Information, such as your email address, may be collected through the Widget.  Cookies may also be set by the Widget to enable it to function properly.  Information collected by this Widget is governed by the privacy policy of the company that created it, which you can access by scrolling over the Widget.
