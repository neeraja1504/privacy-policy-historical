Effective Measure - Privacy Policy
From South Africa? View our Privacy Policy for South Africa.
Your trust and confidence is important to us.
Effective Measure conducts its business under the following privacy principles:
Effective Measure Acts as an Agent for our Clients
Effective Measure acts as an Agent for each of our Clients, in that we provide our Services solely for the benefit of the Client. Each of our Clients uses Effective Measure to understand more about the visitors to its websites; in this way, our Clients can provide online advertisers with third party independent statistics that help demonstrate their site audience. This data may include search engine referral, affiliate referrals, traffic driven by banner ads or other online promotions, how visitors navigate around the site, the most popular websites or sections.
We also collect certain technical information, such as the browser version and operating system. We aggregate all of the usage data from our Clients’ websites into a Benchmarking solution that demonstrates their metrics to advertisers and other interested parties. We do, however, reserve a limited right to disclose any data we collect if required by law or valid order of a court or other governmental authority.
We only collect anonymous usage data from safe websites which are registered on our system. These websites participate in Effective Measure by placing a small piece of tracking code on each of their webpages. To see more information on this, please visit the following link .
Our Clients’ Use of Effective Measure
We ask each of our Clients to abide by all applicable laws, rules and regulations, as we promise our Clients that we will do ourselves. We also recommend that each Client obtain all necessary consents from visitors to its web site(s), post an online privacy policy that provides each visitor with notice of its data collection and use practices (including the Client’s use of Effective Measure), and provide a link to the Effective Measure privacy policy.
Use of Cookies and Other Data Collection Methods
In providing Effective Measure to our Clients, it is Effective Measure’s policy to use cookies and Rich Internet Applications (RIA) only for more accurate traffic analysis. The combination of information does not include personal data such as name, age, phone number, e-mail address or mailing address. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies.
If you would prefer, you can set your browser to reject cookies.
In two specific cases, 1) When a visitor opts in to complete a demographic survey or 2) when they elect to Opt Out of measurement, Effective Measure will utilise a Local Shared Object (a “Flash cookie”) to help identify the users preference and ensure compliance with Opt Outs and privacy wishes. You can clear out or completely disable your local shared object by visiting this page.
Effective Measure’s Clients use JavaScript tracking code provided by Effective Measure to track information about their web site visitors’ activity. This code contacts Effective Measure’s servers and receives a response.
From time to time we may also administer random “interactive pop-up” surveys to some users of our Clients’ Web sites while they are visiting those web sites. These surveys request additional demographic, non-personally identifiable information. Your participation in a survey is always voluntary, and you therefore have a choice as to whether or not to provide the requested survey information. We use the information collected in the survey, in conjunction with information gathered through our cookies and code, in order to provide our Clients with an even more detailed understanding of their Internet audience.
Effective Measure will in some occasions make available to third parties such as research and or marketing companies anonymised cookie information.
Links to Other Web Sites
Our web site contains links to information on other web sites. We do not have any control over these other web sites, and therefore we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information that you provide while visiting those sites. This Privacy Policy does not govern those sites, and if you have questions about how a site uses your information, consult that site’s privacy statement.
Security
We use reasonable organisational, technical and administrative measures to protect personal information under our control. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or data storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us in accordance with the “Contact Us” section on Effective Measure site.
Opting Out
As a visitor to any of our Clients’ sites, you can deactivate our Clients’ abilities to analyse your web browsing behaviour, which will universally deactivate this ability on all Client sites (including the Effective Measure web sites) currently using our Services. To opt out of receiving tracking cookies for all sites using Effective Measure, you will need to accept a cookie indicating your choice to do so.
We will try to comply with your request(s) as soon as reasonably practicable. Please note that if you opt-out as described above, we will not be able to remove your personal information from the databases of our affiliates with which we have already shared it. Please also note that if you do opt-out of receiving marketing-related messages from us, we may still send you important administrative messages as part of your ongoing use of our products or Services.
Please visit our opt out page for more information.

To do this, we may pass your information to them for that purpose only, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.
We sometimes hire vendor companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including packaging, mailing and delivering items, sending postal mail, providing technical support, and processing event registrations. In addition, we may use third party information or technology in our products and disclose Client information to such third parties solely for the purposes of fulfilment, support, or audit by such third parties.
