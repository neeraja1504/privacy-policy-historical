Use of Persistent Cookies
Like many Web sites, this site uses "persistent cookie" technology. A persistent cookie is a small text file that this site places on your computer so that it can remember you when you show up again later. Office of Management and Budget guidance classifies these cookies as a Tier 2 Web customization and measurement technology.
We use persistent cookies in two ways, both of which enhance your experience while also protecting your privacy:
To remember you when you come back to the site so we don't invite you to take our customer satisfaction survey every time you visit. Our customer satisfaction survey uses a persistent cookie to ensure we won't invite you to take another survey within 30 days of having completed one.
To get aggregate metrics on site usage to understand how people are using the site and how we can make it better. We use Web metrics services to track activity on this site. Government agencies only ever receive traffic statistics anonymously and in the aggregate.
Most Internet browsers automatically accept persistent cookies. EFTPS.gov and EFTPS.com have persistent cookies enabled by default, so that we can gather information that will allow us to improve our service. These cookies are provided by ForeSee Results, Inc. and Google Inc. but are delivered by EFTPS®.
Although we think using persistent cookies creates a much better experience for you, this site will also work without them. If you don't want to accept cookies, you can edit your browser's options to stop accepting persistent cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the Websites you visit. To learn about how to do this, visit: http://www.usa.gov/optout_instructions.shtml.
Site Security

Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, no other attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage habits at this site. Raw data logs are scheduled for regular destruction in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration guidelines. Unauthorized attempts to upload information or change information on this service are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act.
