Do we Use Cookies and Why?
eForCity uses cookies in order for us to customize certain Web pages to help identify you and your shopping cart. Cookies are small files sent and stored onto a user’s computer by our web browser. If you disabled the cookies for our website, we will be unable to recognize your browser and identify your shopping cart.
We use your IP address to help administer our Web site and diagnose any problems with our server. Your IP address may also be used by a third part anonymously to gather broad demographic information for research purposes. Personally identifiable information will not be linked to IP addresses.
Your Information Security
We take website security seriously, and have engaged WebSafe Shield to help us provide it. WebSafe Shield provides a service similar to McAfee Secure's daily scanning service, and we are notified as security vulnerabilities are descovered. WebSafe Shield is a leading and trusted security service that offers additional services ranging from PCI Compliance to Application Penetration Testing.
eForCity uses the Security for merchants from Yahoo! Services. Yahoo! uses SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption while transmitting certain kinds of information, such as financial services information or payment information. An icon resembling a padlock is displayed at the bottom of most browser windows during SSL transactions that involve credit cards and other forms of payment. Credit card numbers are SSL encrypted whenever Yahoo! requests it for payment or verification purposes. Customer information will be stored securely on our servers. Once customers choose to store or enter a credit card number on Yahoo!, it will not be displayed in its entirety when customers retrieve or edit it in the future. Instead of the entire number, customers will only see asterisks and either the first four digits or the last four digits of the number.
For information about Yahoo store Security see Security at Yahoo!.

eForCity does not sell, trade, or transfer any of our customer’s personally identifiable information to outside parties. Personal information will not be used beyond what is necessary to assist your purchases and services you have requested. If, at any point, trusted third parties are needed to assist our web site or in servicing you, they must agree to keep this information confidential. eForCity also reserves the right to release your personally identifiable information when required by law enforcement or in order to protect our or other’s rights, safety, or property.
