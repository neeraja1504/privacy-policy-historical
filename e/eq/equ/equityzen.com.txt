We also use information you provide to validate that information, comply with legal requirements, provide customer support and communicate with you, and operate and maintain the Services.  For example, we use the banking information you provide to send you funds when they are due to you, from selling securities on the Site or when proceeds are due to you from investments made through the Site.

To operate the Services:  We share information about you as needed with our own service providers, including financial institutions, fund administrators, accountants, auditors, lawyers, payment providers, information technology staff, advisors and our affiliates. We only share information to the extent it is required to fulfill our obligations to you and to regulators, and to operate the Site and the Services.

We do not--and do not plan to--rent, sell, or share information about you with other people or with non-affiliated companies.
For safety and security:  We use information about you and your Service use to verify your identity, accounts and activity, to monitor suspicious or fraudulent activity, and to identify violations of Service policies.

Legal bases for processing (for EEA users):  If you are an individual residing in the European Economic Area (EEA), we collect and process information about you only where we have legal bases for doing so under applicable EU laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation.  The legal bases depend on the Services you use and how you use them. This means we collect and use your information only where:
We need it to provide you the Services, including to operate the Services, perform a contract with you, take necessary steps prior to performing a contract or at your request, provide customer support, and to protect the safety and security of the Services;
It satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as for research and development, to market and promote the Services, to personalize services you receive, and to protect our legal rights and interests;
You give us consent to do so for a specific purpose; or
We need to process your data to comply with a legal requirement.
If you have consented to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you may change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place.  Where we are using your information because we or a third party (e.g. your employer) have a legitimate interest to do so, you may object to that use though, in some cases, this may mean no longer using the Services. To do so, please email us at support@equityzen.com.

We manage a private company equity marketplace, and we want it to work well for you.  This means sharing information through the Services and with certain third parties.  We share information we collect about you in the ways discussed below, including in connection with possible business transfers, but we are not in the business of selling information about you to advertisers or other third parties.

For example, we may provide certain aspects of your information to our financial institutions, payment processors, fund administrators, accountants, auditors, lawyers, payment providers, third-party hosting service, email and technology providers, information technology staff, advisors, affiliates, marketing and analytics partners, or third-party verification services. If you elect to open an EquityZen Investor Account, we share information with our third-party banking services provider, SynapseFI, and with Evolve Bank & Trust, member FDIC.
