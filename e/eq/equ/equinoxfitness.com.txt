You can adjust how your Internet browser (like Chrome or Safari) responds to cookies (e.g., to warn you every time a cookie is sent, or to turn off all cookies). See your browser's Help menu for these instructions. By disabling your cookies, please understand you will not have access to some of the features that enhance your user experience on the Digital Properties.
