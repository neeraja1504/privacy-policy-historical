Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies
Some of our web pages utilize "cookies" and other tracking technologies. A cookie is a small data file that certain websites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID, which the site uses to track the pages you've visited, but the only Personal Data a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie cannot read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Some parts of Equinix’s web site use cookies to track user traffic patterns. We do this to determine the usefulness of Equinix’s information to our users and to see how effective our navigational structure is in helping users reach that information. Equinix does not correlate this information with Personal Data about individual users, nor does it share this information or sell it to any third party.
