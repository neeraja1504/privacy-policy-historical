Your name
Your contact details
Your bank or credit card details
How you would like us to contact you
We don’t collect date of birth information when buying a train ticket but we recognise that young people use our services and are legally able to provide consent after the age of 13 years. If you are using our travel services and are aged between 13 and 16 years of age we recommend that you read our terms and conditions. We will let you know when you make a booking if there is any further information that we may need to be able to provide products or services you have asked for. We will also tell you which information is optional.
If you purchase a Railcard from Railcards.EastMidlandsTrains.co.uk, you will be asked for your date of birth, this is to validate your age for the Railcard you are selecting.
If you need help with things like getting on and off a train, you may choose to give us confidential information about your disability and the assistance you require. All UK train companies use a system called Passenger Assist to book help on stations and on trains for all services. This makes sure that if you book help in advance, our staff on stations and on the trains know that you are travelling, where you are seated on the train, any connections you have to make and the help you need.
When you visit our website or register to use our on-train wi-fi services, we may collect the following information automatically:
Technical information, including the IP address used to connect your computer to the Internet, your login information, the browser you’re using, time zone setting, browser plug-in types and versions, the operating system and platform you are using;

While we mainly use the personal information that you provide to us yourself, we may sometimes use other public sources of information about our customers and enquirers where you have given your permission for your data to be shared. We do this to help us understand more about our customers and to ensure that our public messages are relevant and to make sure that the marketing information we send you, with your consent, is also relevant.  We take great care in sourcing this information but if you prefer us not to use your data in this way then please let us know by contacting DSAR@eastmidlandstrains.co.uk

For example, we have an interest in making sure our marketing is relevant for you, so we may process your information to send you marketing that is tailored to your interests. It can also apply to processing that is in your interests as well.
When we process your personal information for our legitimate interests, we make sure to consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative), and your rights under data protection laws. Our legitimate business interests do not automatically override your interests - we will not use your Personal Data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law).
Whenever we process data for these purposes we will ensure that we always keep your Personal Data rights in high regard and take account of these rights. You have the right to object to this processing. If you wish to do so, please let us know by contacting DSAR@eastmidlandstrains.co.uk. Please bear in mind that if you object, this may affect our ability to carry out the tasks for your benefit. ****
How we use your personal information

We also have a legal obligation under data protection legislation to keep the personal information we collect accurate and up to date.
