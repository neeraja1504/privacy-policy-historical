Privacy Policy | East Bay Express
The East Bay Express respects your privacy. We will not sell or share any of your personal information to a third party unless you say it's okay. We will gather personally identifiable information about you only when you provide it voluntarily for specific purposes such as posting an ad or signing up for an e-mail newsletter.
Personally Identifiable Information
We track how our visitors use this site so that we can see what readers like and don't like. We also analyze and aggregate information about use patterns and share the aggregated data with our advertisers (for example, we keep track of how many users see and click on particular advertisements). We may also collect personal information about you via registration for contests, surveys, and newsletters, which may include contests, surveys, and newsletters for certain third parties. We will not, however, release your name, e-mail address, or any other personal information to anyone else outside the East Bay Express unless we have your consent, we are under a legal order to do so, or there is an emergency involving danger to a person or property. This means that we will not provide our advertisers or anyone else outside the East Bay Express with any information specific to you unless we have your consent.
If you choose to provide your personally identifiable information for the purposes of a third-party contest, survey, or newsletter, your consent shall be deemed to be given for the release of your personally identifiable information with regard to that third party only, in addition to the East Bay Express. The only East Bay Express employees or consultants allowed access to personal information about you are those who need to have access. Any employee or consultant who violates our privacy and security policies is subject to disciplinary action, including possible termination or prosecution.
We occasionally have third-party agents, subsidiaries, affiliates, and joint ventures that perform functions on our behalf, such as credit-card processing, shipping or stocking orders, providing customer service, etc. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, and are contractually obligated to maintain the confidentiality and security of the data. They are restricted from using or altering this data in anyway other than to provide the requested services to the web site.
Please remember that any information you share in public areas such as message boards becomes public, and therefore this privacy policy does not apply to any information you choose to make public. Please be careful about what you disclose and do not post any personal information that you expect to keep private.
