Your Privacy Rights
Last Updated: 3/28/2013
This website is owned and operated by EasyFinance.com. We want you to understand what information we gather about you; how we use it and the safeguards we have in place to protect it.  This Privacy Policy applies to information collected through this website and otherwise.   This Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with information that we collect through this website owned and controlled by us which display or link to this Privacy Policy (the “Site”).  By using our Sites, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.
Who We Are and What We Do
EasyFinance.com (“EasyFinance”) operates a prospective customer database ("Service") by which it compiles, sorts and sells contact information to businesses on behalf of individual consumers who have shown an interest in applying for a business' products or services and has affirmatively asked to be contacted by a representative of a product or service business. EasyFinance.com utilizes third party vendors, third party affiliates, and a variety of media advertisements to promote the Site to consumers interested in completing an online application at our Site or to supplement our database by purchasing their database of consumers who have completed applications on websites other than EasyFinance's and have affirmatively requested receipt of information about product or service offerings similar to those offered on EasyFinance's Site.
EasyFinance also promotes its product and service offerings via e-mail or telephone to consumers who requested that they be contacted either through our online application opt-in process via our Site or through an Opt-In process on one of our many vendor or affiliate sites (List Members). List Members will then receive email or telephone contacts only for so long as they wish to continue to receive such contacts.
List Members can get off our telephone and e-mail contact lists at any time, no questions asked. You can remove yourself from further contact from EasyFinance by clicking on the OPT-Out link contained in each e-mail, or by sending in your OPT-Out request via e-mail to office@easyfinance.com.
If you choose to remove yourself from our contact list, if applicable, we will also forward your name and contact information to the specific vendor or affiliate marketer who provided your informational request to us so that they can include your name on their do-not-contact list too. Please bear in mind that if your information was purchased commercially from a third party vendor, EasyFinance may not be the only data EasyFinance your contact information was sold to. Additionally, our third party vendor or affiliate may have purchased your contact information from someone else and thus you may continue to receive contacts.html from those companies as well. EasyFinance is not responsible for stopping all unwanted contacts.html from sources beyond our immediate control.
