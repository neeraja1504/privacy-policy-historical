Your name, email address and other information you choose to provide on the website will be forwarded to the University, College or their representatives when you submit an application for University or College admissions via our website.
We may use your email address to send you website-related notices (including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail). We may also use your contact information to send you marketing messages. If you don’t want to receive these messages, you can opt out by following the instructions in the message. If you correspond with us by email, we may retain the content of your email messages, your email address and our responses.
If you choose to use our invitation website to invite a friend to the website, we will ask you for that person’s email address and automatically send an email invitation. EASYUNI stores this information to send this email, to register your friend if your invitation is accepted, and to track the success of our invitation website.

EASYUNI can, but has no obligation, to monitor your Content you post on the website. We can remove any information you post for any reason or no reason.
Cookies : When you use the website, we may send one or more “cookies” – a small data file – to your computer to uniquely identify your browser and let EASYUNI help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site. A cookie may convey anonymous information about how you browse the website to us. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser so that it can be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the website. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser’s directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the website may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.
Log Files : When you use the website, our servers automatically record certain information sent by your web browser. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the website, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, mobile carrier, and other such information.
Clear Gifs Information : When you use the website, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to track the online usage patterns. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients. The information is used to enable more accurate reporting and make EASYUNI better for our users.
Geo-Location Information : When you use the website by or through a mobile device, we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store “location data,” which may include GPS coordinates (e.g. latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding the location of your mobile device. Location data may convey information about how you browse the website to us. Location data does not collect or share any personally identifiable information about you. Location data may be used in conjunction with personally identifiable information. Some features of the website, particularly location-based websites, may not function properly if use or availability of location data is impaired or disabled.
Device Identifiers : When you access the website by or through a mobile device, we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store one or more “device identifiers.” Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device and are used to enhance the website. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by us. A device identifier may convey information about how you use the website to us. A device identifier does not collect or share any personally identifiable information about you. A device identifier may be used in conjunction with personally identifiable information. A device identifier may remain persistently on your device, to help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the website. Some features of the website may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers are impaired or disabled. EASYUNI may access, collect and/or store device identifiers upon enabling EASYUNI’s websites.
Third Party Tools : EASYUNI uses third party analytics tools, such as Google Analytics, to help understand use of the website. Many of these tools collect the information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, including cookies and your IP address. These analytics tools also receive this information and their use of it is governed by their privacy policy.

We may also store personal information in locations outside the direct control of EASYUNI (for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers).
Business Transfers : As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings. Customers, email, and visitor information is generally one of the transferred business assets in these types of transactions. We may also transfer or assign such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or dissolution.
Third Party websites : We may share your information with a third party application with your consent, for example when you choose to access our websites through such an application.

How We Protect Your Information
The security of your information is important to us. In the event that personal information is compromised as a result of a breach of security, EASYUNI will promptly notify those persons whose personal information has been compromised, in accordance with the notification procedures set forth in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise required by applicable law.

If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at privacy@easyuni.com.
