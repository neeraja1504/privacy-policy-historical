You will know we have changed the Policy when you see a new updated date at the top of this Policy. ESE will not notify the Services' users of any such changes by e-mail or other personal contact. We encourage you to check the date of this Policy whenever you visit the Services so that you will know when you need to review the Policy for modifications.
III. INFORMATION COLLECTION
ESE may collect and store any information you voluntarily submit or upload through the Website or Services, whether through your request for more information, registration, purchase, or otherwise. Such information may include name, email address, billing and payment information, contact information, personal preferences, or any other information submitted by any user through the Services.
ESE collects information about how you found ESE, including determining the identity of an individual that referred you to ESE through a hyperlink associated with that individual.

ESE may use third-party companies, agents, or contractors to perform services on our behalf. For example, ESE may partner with other companies to personalize our web pages, process credit card transactions, collect debts, analyze or enhance the data collected by the Services (including user's interaction with the Services), or otherwise assist ESE in better serving the Services' users.

These companies are not permitted to use your personal information except for the purpose of providing the services we request of them.
ESE may partner with third-party companies, agents, or contractors in order to offer users joint promotions, advertisements, programs and marketing campaigns in which we believe our users may be interested.
