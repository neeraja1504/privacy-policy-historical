Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.

Cookies: Information and Policy
King & McGaw's websites use cookies. Cookies are pieces of code that allow small amounts of information to be passed from your internet browser to our web server. King & McGaw use our own cookies, as well as those from third parties, serving several purposes. They allow us to remember whether you are logged in to the site, to remember what items you had in your shopping basket, to serve you with content tailored specifically for you and to help us learn about how you like to use our website and where we can make it better.
King & McGaw will never disclose your personal details to any third parties. All data passed by cookies is anonymous and will never contain your name, address, telephone number, email address, IP address or payment details.
You can learn more about cookies, how we use them, how to manage them and about our third party partnerships below.
What is a cookie?
Cookies are small text files that are created by your browser and placed on your computer or browsing device, at the request of websites that you visit. Cookies allow websites to recognise your computer or web browser. They can help to analyse which products or parts of a website you looked at, and how long for.
Websites may also use web beacons or 'tags' to do a similar job. Like cookies, web beacons are used to collect non-personal information about the way you browse websites. An example of this could be remembering what products you placed in your shopping basket last time you visited.
A web beacon is a transparent graphic image that is placed on a website or in an email and is used to see when that web page or email has been displayed.
Third party cookies and web beacons can also be used to help present you with appropriate offers and advertising as you browse other sites on the internet.
Note:
Cookies and web beacons are not able to retrieve any information from your computer that you have not already given to a website.
Cookies and web beacons are not able to be used to put malware or viruses on your computer.
Cookies and web beacons are not able to be used to control the functionality or settings of your computer or web browsing device.
Why does King & McGaw use cookies?
Cookies allow us to present you with relevant products and services that are based on the way that you want to use our website, providing you with an enhanced browsing and shopping experience.
For example, cookies allow us to remember what products you placed in your shopping basket, whether you were logged in or not, and what language you were using to read the site last time you visited.
Cookies and web beacons allow us to work alongside our web analytics partner to see how our customers like to use our websites and which pages or special functions they prefer. This helps us to continually improve our service.
Third party cookies and web beacons are also used with our marketing partners to present you with appropriate offers and advertising as you browse other sites on the internet, based on the products you looked at while on our site.
Note:
King & McGaw's cookies and those of our third party partners will never be used to collect any personal data. This includes your name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card information or any other payment details.
Turning off and deleting cookies
Most web browsers will provide the option to disallow cookies and web beacons. How you do this depends on the web browser you're using. Instructions for disallowing cookies can usually be found in the browser's 'Help' menu.
Cookies can also be deleted using your internet browser. However, unless they are disallowed they will be re-applied the next time you visit a website.
Note:
In common with most other transactional websites, refusing cookies via your web browser will mean that you are unable to make a transactional purchase on King & McGaw's websites. You will also find that the functionality of many other websites and services will be affected.
Disallowing cookies will prevent web beacons from tracking your specific activity online. However, web beacons may still record anonymous data from your IP address.
For more detailed information about cookies and web beacons please visit www.allaboutcookies.org.
Where exactly do King & McGaw use cookies?
Cookies are used by all King & McGaw transactional websites.
There are two types of cookie that may be used during your visit to an King & McGaw website:
1. Session cookies
Session cookies are deleted after each 'session'. For example, when you are browsing an King & McGaw website, it will remember you for the duration of your visit, but the cookie will be removed from your computer as soon as you close down your internet browser.
Without a session cookie, every time you open a new web page the web server where that page is stored will treat you like a completely new visitor and items placed in your shopping basket will disappear by the time you reach the checkout.
2. Persistent cookies
Persistent cookies remember you for a set period of time (unless you delete them).
On your first visit to an King & McGaw site, you will be presented the site in a default manner. Over time, the version of the site you see may change, as persistent cookies remember items you have viewed, preference changes you have made, or whether you logged into or out of your account while browsing.
Here is a list of the different types of cookies used by King & McGaw:
Cookie purpose | Cookie type | Summary
---|---|---
Transaction | Session cookie | Used to maintain your transaction with King & McGaw and minimise the need to transfer your information across the internet.
Navigation | Last viewed product | Used to help you return to the last viewed product, for instance after adding an item to the cart.
King & McGaw third party marketing partner cookies
