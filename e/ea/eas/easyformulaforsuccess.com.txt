This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of individuals or companies that EasyFormulaForSuccess.com does not own or control or to individuals or other business entities that EasyFormulaForSuccess.com does not employ and manage. Although EasyFormulaForSuccess.com requires EasyFormulaForSuccess.com Affiliates and Publishers to adhere to Good Business Practices as a condition of their doing business with EasyFormulaForSuccess.com, EasyFormulaForSuccess.com does not own or control such Affiliates and Publishers, and as such, EasyFormulaForSuccess.com is not responsible for the information use and/or information gathering practices of any Affiliate or Publisher. Affiliates and Publishers are not employees or agents of EasyFormulaForSuccess.com, and the Internet User should understand that Affiliates and Publishers may collect personal information from or about Internet Users in manners and/or for purposes that are not consistent with the EasyFormulaForSuccess.com Privacy Policy. The collection, use, and disclosure of information by Affiliates and Publishers are subject to their own respective privacy policies, which may materially differ both in form and substance from the EasyFormulaForSuccess.com Privacy Policy.

Additionally, EasyFormulaForSuccess.com displays targeted advertisements based on personal information. Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click on targeted ads meet their targeting criteria - for example, women ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area. EasyFormulaForSuccess.com does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad, you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad. EasyFormulaForSuccess.com advertisers include financial service providers (such as banks, insurance agents, stock brokers and mortgage lenders) and non-financial companies (such as stores, airlines, and software companies).
