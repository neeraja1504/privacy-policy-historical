EasyVista Data & Privacy Policy
EasyVista is a recognized software provider specialized in helping organizations simplify IT Service Management by making it easy to deliver and easy to use for today’s enterprise. EasyVista respects individual privacy of its customers, employees, business partners, visitors and others (Persons Concerned). EasyVista is vigilant to comply with the laws of the countries in which it does business regarding Personal Information that is collected, used, stored, processed and disclosed.
This Privacy Policy ("Policy") applies to:
Data collected on EasyVista web-sites for sales and marketing purposes.
Data collected for the delivery of the EasyVista software and associated services such as hosting services, consulting, support and training.
Data collected for accounting, human resources management and other administrative purposes.
Regarding consent, EasyVista offers Persons Concerned, a choice to opt-out of uses and disclosures of their data that are incompatible with the purposes for which that data was originally collected or subsequently authorized.
When acting as data processor for a customer, EasyVista is not responsible for the obligations of the data controller to obtain from Persons Concerned the appropriate consent to transfer and process their data to EasyVista. As a data processor, EasyVista will not sell, rent, or trade with third parties for their marketing purposes any personal data collected.
In the event that sensitive personal information (pertaining to your racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, information related to an individual's health or sexual preference, as well as biometric identifiers, such as finger and voiceprints, and information as to commission or alleged commission of a criminal offense or any related proceedings) to be used for a new purpose or transferred to the control of a third party not acting on behalf of EasyVista, the data subject's explicit consent will be obtained prior to the new use or transfer of the data, unless such new use or transfer is: (1) in the vital interests of the data subject or another person; (2) necessary for the establishment of EasyVista's legal claims of defenses; (3) required to provide medical care or diagnosis; (4) necessary to carry out EasyVista's obligations in the field of employment law; or (5) related to data that are manifestly made public by the data subject. In these cases, data subjects are given notice of such use.
EasyVista takes reasonable and appropriate physical, technical, and organizational measures to protect personal data in its possession from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Even with all these safeguards in place, no method of transmission over the Internet is totally secure and EasyVista does not guarantee the security of personal information transmitted via the Internet.
EasyVista will use personal data only in ways that are compatible with and relevant for the purposes for which it was collected or subsequently authorized. EasyVista takes reasonable and appropriate physical, technical, and organizational measures to ensure that personal data is relevant to its intended use, and that it is accurate, complete, reliable, and current. EasyVista will retain the personal data for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data was collected or for which it is to be further processed.
Data’s subject may contact EasyVista to access their personal data at privacy@easyvista.com. Upon request, EasyVista will grant reasonable access to personal data. EasyVista will also take reasonable measures to permit data’s subject to access, rectify, erase, restrict processing or delete information that is demonstrated to be inaccurate or incomplete, except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to data’s subject privacy. Furthermore, EasyVista will, upon request of a data’s subject, provide personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format.
