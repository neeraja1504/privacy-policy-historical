Some information is collected through Cookies as described below.
Cookies
An Internet user's browser normally places Cookies that contain small amounts of data on the Internet user's computer after a visit to any Website. Cookies assist easyAd in tracking Internet users' activities beginning from a Member's Website or e-mail.

The Cookies tell easyAd nothing about the Internet user personally.
Cookies are used
when an advertiser's banner image or other text is loaded on a Webpage for viewing by an Internet user, and
when the banner or other text is clicked by an Internet user.
The function of these Cookies is to provide easyAd with information solely for the purpose of paying a Member's commissions when an Internet user clicks on a link or makes a purchase on an advertiser's Website.
This website uses etracker technology (www.etracker.com) to collect visitor behavior data. This data is collected anonymously to be used for marketing and optimization purposes.
