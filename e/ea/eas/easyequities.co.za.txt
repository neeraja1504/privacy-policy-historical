subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping
addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Easy Equities Website, the information you previously provided can
be retrieved, so you can easily use the Easy Equities features that you customized.
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually
modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully
experience the interactive features of the Easy Equities services or Websites you visit.
