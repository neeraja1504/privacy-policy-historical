This Privacy Policy applies to information that may be collected by or on behalf of Easy Spirit, such as in an Easy Spirit store, online at easyspirit.com, and through customer service representatives. Our Privacy Policy tells you the types of information we collect, how we use this information, and when we share it with third parties or our affiliated brands and affiliated companies.
The information on this website and our Privacy Policy are subject to change from time to time. We will post at the top of this Privacy Policy the date that modifications were last made, which should alert you to any changes since your last visit to the website. Any material changes to our Privacy Policy and practices will be reflected on this page. Please read and refer to this Privacy Policy from time to time so that you are aware of our current privacy practices. Your continued use of the website after the posted effective date constitutes your agreement to the then revised Privacy Policy. By doing business with Easy Spirit and by accessing and using our website or by providing personal information online or at one of the Easy Spirit store locations, you consent to the collection and use of this information by Easy Spirit as described in this Privacy Policy.

Easy Spirit may collect and store two types of information: “personal information” and “automatic information.”
Personal information
tells us who you are such as your name, gender, billing address, shipping address, email address, telephone number, date of birth or age, any personal preferences you choose to provide, transaction details such as style, size, price, discount, date, store, your credit card number and expiration date used for transactions, and any assigned password used to protect your privacy.
Automatic information
is information that we may collect automatically whenever you interact with this website, such as your IP address, the type of computer you use, the web browser you use, the web page that linked you to our site, and the way you navigated our website and the products you viewed. An IP address is a number assigned to your computer when you connect to the Internet. Each time you visit this website, our web server may automatically recognize and collect this information. Automatic information also includes information generated by the use of “cookies” and “web beacons”. You may click here to find out more about the use of cookies and web beacons.
We may associate automatic information with your personal information. In the event of such association, such automatic information will be considered personal information.
.
Easy Spirit collects data that you provide to us in the following ways: (i) on easyspirit.com; (ii) through transactions, email registrations, participation in sweepstakes, contests, quizzes and surveys, or online memberships; (iii) by communicating with the sales associates in Easy Spirit stores and outlets; (iv) through phone, mail and fax interactions or paper registrations that you submit to Easy Spirit; and (v) from information collected about you by our affiliated brands or certain other brands and shared with Easy Spirit. For information about Easy Spirit’s affiliated brands and other brands with whom we may share information, please click here.
Easy Spirit also collects data that we obtain from third parties. We occasionally obtain email addresses of active Easy Spirit store customers who requested emails regarding fashion on other websites. Easy Spirit also may obtain publicly accessible customer demographics and information about you from commercially available databases and sources.
Easy Spirit also collects automatic information through the use of cookies or pixel tags (also known as web beacons).
.
A “cookie” is a small text file that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Among other things, cookies provide a means for us to keep track of your online patterns and preferences. By understanding which areas of the site you visit, cookies allow us to present information, products and services that are of personal interest and make our website more efficient. Some of the ways we may use cookies include enabling your log-in, identifying your shopping carts, tracking where you travel on our websites and what you look at and purchase, and for marketing testing and product recommendations.
Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies but allow you to change your browser so that it will not automatically accept cookies. Various browsers have different ways to inform you when a cookie has been sent to you, limit the kinds of cookies that can be placed on your computer and let you delete cookies. Please refer to your browser instructions or help screen to learn more about these functions. Additionally, if you have a Flash player installed on your computer, flash cookies may be stored. Flash cookies are different from browser cookies and the cookie management tools provided by your browser will not necessarily remove Flash cookies. The latest versions of many browsers let you control or delete Flash cookies through the browser’s settings. If you use an older version of one of these browsers, upgrade to the most recent version, and set it to update automatically. However, if you delete or remove cookies, it is possible that some portions of the site may not function as intended.
“Web beacons” also known as pixel tags, clear GIFs or single-pixel GIFs, or similar technologies are small image files that we may place on web pages and within web-based email newsletters that we send. Working in conjunction with cookies, web beacons allow us to accurately count the number of unique users who have visited a specific page and the number of times those pages are displayed. We can also use web beacons to let us know how many people opened a web-based email newsletter or message.
Easy Spirit also uses third party internet analytics firms, such as Adobe Analytics and others, to place cookies and pixel tags on your computer or browser when you visit our website. These third parties collect automatic information to track and analyze usage and volume statistical information regarding your visits to our website, such as what you browsed and purchased, what web page linked you to our site and what traffic is driven by banner ads and e-mails. To learn more about Adobe Analytics and how to opt out, please visit http://www.adobe.com/privacy/analytics.html#1.
We may also collect geolocation data based on your then current location, including that of any mobile devices you may have used to access our website, to provide location-based services.

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be unconditionally guaranteed to be secure. Therefore, any information you transmit to us is sent at your own risk.
However, when you place an order online, we use encryption technology, such as Secure Socket Layer technology ("SSL"), to protect your personal information during data transport. SSL encrypts your order information, including your name, address, and credit card number, before it is transmitted to us to avoid the decoding of your information by anyone other than Easy Spirit.
In addition, when you create an online account on easyspirit.com, you must select a personal password. As a member of Easy Spirit’s website, you will be able to view, among other things, your account profile, contact preferences, order history and address book. We store this type of information so that you do not have to reenter it each time you make a purchase or visit the website. Should you decide to become a member of Easy Spirit’s website, you will be asked to provide an accurate email address and create a password. In order to help protect your personal information, you should be careful about maintaining the secrecy of your password and any username associated with your account.
.
Easy Spirit maintains a database of customer information collected by Easy Spirit. The database is maintained and operated by third party service providers and also houses customer information collected by certain other brands. In addition to Easy Spirit, these brands include Nine West, Bandolino, Anne Klein and Kasper. When you establish or update your customer profile information with Easy Spirit, whether through a purchase, registration or email sign-up at the Easy Spirit website, at an Easy Spirit store, or through a customer service representative, or in other communications you may have with Easy Spirit, your name and address on the database will be shared with and updated for any of the brands on the shared database for which you have established a customer profile.
All of the information that Easy Spirit collects may be shared with the Nine West, Bandolino, Anne Klein and Kasper brands and with other affiliated brands of Nine West Holdings, Inc., including Enzo Angiolini, Joan & David, Pappagallo, lonna & lilly, Napier, Judith Jack, Gloria Vanderbilt, L.e.i. and Energie, among others.

We may also disclose personal information when we reasonably believe that the law requires it. We might sell or buy subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, personally identifiable information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing privacy policy unless subsequent consent otherwise has been obtained from you. Also, in the event that assets of Easy Spirit are sold, personal information collected through this website or other means may be one of the transferred assets. Accordingly, we reserve the right to assign our rights and duties under this Privacy Policy to any third party at any time without notice to you, and such assignment rights shall include the ability to make an assignment in connection with any sale, merger, acquisition, divestiture or liquidation of all or part of our business or assets related to the website, all or substantially all of our other business or assets, or as part of any reorganization or restructuring of our business or assets.
