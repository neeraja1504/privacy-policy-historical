Privacy Policy
Notice
Earth Mama® has written this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. We use your Personal Information to help you quickly find goods, services or information on the site. We track all users who visit this site and use that data to analyze for trends and statistics. The data we collect is archived and only used for informational purposes within Earth Mama and is never sold, rented, leased, or given to any other company. Our site uses an order form, a gift registry, and a birth plan for customers to request information, products, and services. We collect visitor's contact information such as their names, email addresses, and billing and shipping addresses. This information is used to send orders, information about our company, the birth plan, and to facilitate Earth Mama Angel Baby's ability to market our product.
We use non-persistent cookies on our site to control shopping carts. These cookies are temporary and will be removed when you close your browser window. You can completely restrict the use of cookies on your computer by turning "cookies off" on your computer's browser. However, if you choose to do this, you will not be able to order products from Earth Mama's shopping cart.
Any information that we collect is never sold, rented, traded or leased to third parties.
This site contains links to other sites. Earth Mama is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of other web sites.

Our site provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us at the point where we request information. On any page that requires you to submit personally identifiable information, you have the option at that point to deny permission for future contact. Users may revoke consent for future contact with Earth Mama at any time by sending an email message to mayihelpyoumama@earthmama.com. If you revoke your consent, all information we have regarding you will be erased within one week. We sometimes are required by court orders or other laws to divulge information about you to law enforcement authorities, to government agencies or to the court.

Users may also change or modify the information previously provided by sending an email to mayihelpyoumama@earthmama.com.
Security
The security of the information that you provide to us is very important to us. Hence, we have taken several measures to protect your information. All transactions involving sensitive information, such as your credit/debit card number, are conducted using an SSL (Secure Socket Layer protocol) connection. This connection provides increased security to the information that is transmitted to our website. We will only use your credit/debit number for the processing of your payment. Other sensitive information that we may collect will not be disclosed to third parties unless we are required to do so by law.

We will post any substantive changes in this privacy policy at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect. Any information collected under this current policy will remain bound by the terms of this privacy policy.
