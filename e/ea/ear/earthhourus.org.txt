I. WHAT INFORMATION MAY BE COLLECTED
WWF collects two kinds of information: personal information that you choose to supply us, and non-personal information, such as your IP address.
A. Personally Identifiable Information
Newsletters, Online Postcards, Donations and Other WWF Information
If you subscribe to a WWF e-newsletter, request additional information about WWF, submit a donation online, or participate in any of the other services on the WWF web site that require personal information, we may request your name, mailing address, telephone number, email address, birth year, and eligibility to vote, in order to respond to your inquiries. If you send a friend an online postcard, we may request your name and email address as well as the name and email address of the friend to whom you wish to send the postcard. WWF may collect and store the information you choose to provide us to send you information about WWF and WWF partners and third parties from time to time. If you make a donation to WWF and elect to pay online, WWF will collect the necessary financial information. WWF collects and stores some information the user chooses to provide, including name, address and email address, to send users information about WWF and WWF partners and third parties from time to time. WWF will not disclose financial information except as necessary to fulfill users' donation requests. WWF collects such financial information in a secure manner and discards such financial information after processing.
Sweepstakes, Contests and Promotions
From time to time, we may request information from you via online polls, surveys, sweepstakes or contests. Participation in these survey, sweepstakes or contests is completely voluntary; you have a choice whether or not to disclose information required to enter. Information requested may include personal contact information such as your name, shipping and email addresses. Contact information will be used to notify winners, award prizes and contact users with further information about WWF products and services, as well as the products and services of WWF partners and third parties. Survey information will be used for the purposes of monitoring or improving use and satisfaction of the WWF web site.
Conservation Action Network
WWF's Conservation Action Network (CAN) collects and uses personally identifiable information in connection with grassroots outreach and advocacy efforts. In order to use CAN's tools to send emails, faxes, or letters to decision makers, we require a user to provide a name, mailing address, and email address. Participation in CAN is entirely voluntary. Information collected is used for the promotion of WWF and CAN legislative goals, grassroots outreach and policy advocacy.

IP Addresses and Environmental Variables
WWF may also collect information through IP addresses or environmental variables. An "IP address" is a number used by computers on the network to identify your computer so that data can be transmitted to you. "Environmental variables" include, among other things, the domain from which you access the Internet, the time you accessed our web site, type of web browser and operating system or platform used, the Internet address of the web site you left to visit WWF, the names of the pages you visit while at our web site, and the Internet address of the web site you then visit.

This information may be aggregated in an anonymous manner.
II. HOW INFORMATION MAY BE USED
We may share personally and non-personally identifiable information with third parties that help manage our web site and databases and with our partners and affiliates. We will not, however, share personally identifiable information obtained from activists when they subscribe to CAN or to send a message to a decision maker using CAN, with the following two exceptions: (1) when you take action, you will be identified on the action itself as the sender - for example, in the fax or email sent to the decision-maker; (2) we may share personally identifiable information with third parties that help manage our web site and databases, who are subject to a confidentiality agreement.
