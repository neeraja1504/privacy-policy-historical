EarthShare values and respects its donors’ right to privacy. It affirms that its fund-raising practices protect against unauthorized use of its contributor lists, and permits no general telephone solicitation of the public.
EarthShare utilizes donors’ personal information such as names, mailing addresses and email addresses only for purposes of donor acknowledgement and/or when an individual voluntarily provides this information and opts to join our mailing list. EarthShare does not share donors’ personal or contact information with any third party organizations for purposes of solicitation.
For purposes of individual donor acknowledgement, EarthShare releases donor names, contact information and donation amounts to those EarthShare member charities that are designated by our donors, and only with the written consent of our donors. EarthShare strives to ensure that all donors who request acknowledgment receive appropriate acknowledgment in an orderly, timely and effective manner from the managing federation (either an EarthShare affiliate or chapter, or the national office) and the recipient member charity (for designated gifts).
