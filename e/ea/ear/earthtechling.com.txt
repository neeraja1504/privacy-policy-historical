Cookies
A cookie is a data file that certain websites write to your computer’s hard drive when you visit such sites.

We use this data on an anonymous basis and we do not correlate this information with personal data of any user. Business partners of EarthTechling and vendors providing hosting and other services for EarthTechling, as well as advertisers who contract directly with a third-party service to serve their advertisements, may set their own cookies which may collect similar anonymous information.

To Target Content
To develop content targeted to your interests, we use aggregated user information to determine which areas of our Website users prefer based upon traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but instead how well each page or content area performs overall.
To Provide Interactive Communications From EarthTechling
To enhance your experience we may provide you with interactive communications, such as electronic newsletters, to the e-mail address that you provide to us. Such interactive communications are provided only to those users who have expressly provided us with their permission to receive them as part of their user profile.
From time to time we may provide e-mails highlighting new features, promotions or contests on the Website to those users who have expressly provided us with their permission to send such communications as part of their user profile.
Sharing of Information
We respect the privacy of our users and shall not disclose or distribute our user list to any third party, nor shall we permit anyone else to do so.
Aggregate, Anonymous Information With Advertisers

In order to attract and retain advertisers we use the aggregated, anonymous information that we gather to describe our services to business associates and to assist our advertisers and sponsors to better understand our audience. We do not disclose personally identifying information about our users to these parties.
As Necessary to Provide Services to You
We may hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as handling the processing and delivery of newsletter mailings, or performing statistical analysis of our services. We will only provide those companies the personal information they need to deliver the service. These companies are subject to agreements that require them to maintain the confidentiality of your information and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.
As Required By Law
EarthTechling may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on EarthTechling or to protect and defend the rights or property of EarthTechling.
Security
Your information is stored on EarthTechling’s servers located in the United States. We use procedural and technical safeguards to protect your personal information against loss or theft as well as unauthorized access and disclosure to protect your privacy, including encryption, “firewalls” and Secure Socket Layers. We treat data as an asset that must be protected against loss and unauthorized access. We employ many different security techniques to protect such data from unauthorized access by users inside and outside the company. However, “perfect security” does not exist on the Internet.
