Privacy Policy | Earthjustice
We consider it a privilege when you choose to support Earthjustice. At Earthjustice, your privacy and security are critically important to us.
Our fundamental privacy principles are transparency and fairness. In keeping with these principles, Earthjustice (“Earthjustice,” “we,” “our” or “us”) wants you to understand what kinds of information we collect about you, why we collect it and how we use or disclose it. We also want to make sure you know your rights regarding our collection, use and disclosure of that information.
We’ve tried to write this policy in a way that’s easy to understand, but some of it is technical. If you have any questions or concerns about this policy, please contact us.
This policy applies solely to information collected by earthjustice.org (the “Site”), and is effective February 15, 2019. If you use our Site on or after February 15, 2019, you agree to the new policy.
The Kinds Of Information We Collect About You
Earthjustice has implemented administrative and technical security measures to safeguard any personally identifying information we collect online against unauthorized access, destruction, or alteration.
Information we collect from you is stored on secure servers and is not publicly accessible, unless you chose to have Earthjustice disclose your personally identifiable information, for example, when you use our advocacy service to contact decision-makers. We use encrypted connections when processing financial and advocacy transactions through our website.
