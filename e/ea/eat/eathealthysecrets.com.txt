1. Collection of Information.
1.1 Survey Information.
Eat Healthy Secrets collects information from individuals by various methods, including, but not limited to, when an individual voluntarily completes a Eat Healthy Secrets survey, order form, or a registration pages either online or offline, or by means of online or offline surveys, order forms, or registration pages operated by third parties (collectively, a "Survey"). (As used herein, "online" means using the Internet, including the Websites, and related technologies, and "offline" means by methods other than online, including in person, in the postal mail, using telephones and cell phones, and other similar means.) In the Surveys, Eat Healthy Secrets or a third party (a "Third Party") may ask an individual to provide various information to Eat Healthy Secrets , which may include his or her name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, personal and online interests, and such other information as may be requested from time to time (together, "Survey Information"). Eat Healthy Secrets may also collect information concerning an individual from another source and uses that information in combination with information provided from this web site. Completing the Surveys is completely voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to provide Survey Information to Eat Healthy Secrets or Third Party, but an individual may receive incentives from Eat Healthy Secrets or a Third Party in exchange for providing Survey Information to Eat Healthy Secrets.
1.3 Other Information.
Other occasions when Eat Healthy Secrets obtains information from individuals include (1) when an individual is making a claim for a prize or seeking to redeem an incentive offered by Eat Healthy Secrets or by a third party, (2) when an individual requests assistance through Eat Healthy Secrets's customer service department, and (3) when an individual voluntarily subscribes to a Eat Healthy Secrets service or newsletter (together, "Other Information").
1.4 Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology.
Eat Healthy Secrets currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about an individual with information about the individual in our database. Additionally, Eat Healthy Secrets may use other new and evolving sources of information in the future (together, "Technology Information").
(a) Cookies.
A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individual's computer that allows Eat Healthy Secrets to identify the individual with his or her corresponding data that resides in Eat Healthy Secrets database. You may read more about cookies at http://cookiecentral.com. Individuals who use the Websites need to accept cookies in order to use all of the features and functionality of the Websites.
(b) Web Beacons.
A web beacon is programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page (by using an programming function -- see http://truste.org for more information), but can also be used to transfer an individual's unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows Eat Healthy Secrets to track certain web sites an individual visits online. Web beacons are used to determine products or services an individual may be interested in, and to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes. For example, Eat Healthy Secrets might place, with the consent of a third party website, a web beacon on the third party's website where fishing products are sold. When Bill, an individual listed in Eat Healthy Secrets's database, visits the fishing website, Eat Healthy Secrets receives notice by means of the web beacon that Bill visited the fishing site, and Eat Healthy Secrets would then update Bill's profile with the information that Bill is interested in fishing. Eat Healthy Secrets may thereafter present offers of fishing related products and services to Bill. In addition to using web beacons on web pages, Eat Healthy Secrets also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in Eat Healthy Secrets's database.
(c) New Technology.
