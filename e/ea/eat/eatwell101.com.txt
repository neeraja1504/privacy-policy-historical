Editorial Policy
Eatwell 101’s recommendations are selected by our editorial staff and trusted contributors.
Most important, our taste is not for sale. Brands and establishments cannot pay to be recommended by Eatwell 101. Our sponsors and advertisers are featured in obvious positions on our website and emails, because we believe your trust is essential to our success.
If you’re a business owner or publicist or just an ardent fan of a local establishment, a brand or a website, you can suggest it to our editors. See our Contact page for information by clicking here.
Tip/Advertorial Email
Occasionally we’ll send you a Partner Tip email from one of our advertisers. These advertorial features are clearly marked as such by the email’s subject line and a note at the top of the article itself. The content of these Partner Tips is paid for by our sponsors, and does not reflect the opinions of the Eatwell 101 editorial staff.
Privacy Policy
Eatwell101.com is committed to maintaining the privacy and protection of your personal information. This privacy policy tells you about the information we collect on our website and how we use that information. By using the Eatwell101.com website, you are consenting to the information collection and use practices described in this privacy policy, which may be modified from time to time by us.
Children Under 13:
We care about protecting the privacy of children. We won’t knowingly allow anyone under 13 to provide us any personally identifying information. Children should always get permission from their parents before sending any information about themselves (such as their names, email addresses, and phone numbers) over the Internet, to us or to anyone else. If you’re under 13, please do not provide us with any personally identifying information (such as your name, your email address or your phone number).
COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act):
When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States’ consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children’s privacy and safety online.
WE DO NOT SPECIFICALLY MARKET TO CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 13 YEARS OLD.
