Privacy
I take your privacy very seriously. If you have any questions on my privacy policy that are not addressed below, please contact Dick Eastman. Telephone numbers, email address, FAX numbers, and more are available at http://blog.eogn.com/eastmans_online_genealogy//contact-us.html
E-mail Address
When you subscribe, your e-mail address is added to the list of subscribers and is only used to send your issues and occasional notices of offers from business partners. Also, about once a year or so, I may send a special notice.
I hate spam so I do not send spam. I will not add your name to anyone's e-mail list without your permission. I will not sell, rent, or otherwise share your e-mail address with anyone else.
You can remove your address from my e-mailing list by following the instructions at the end of every e-mail message I send. Removing your address only takes a second or two and you can do that at any time.
Personal Information
I will never ask you for personal information – your credit card number, for example – except when you place an order. At that time, I will provide a secure (SSL, encrypted) connection and require you to submit only the information needed to complete and fulfill your order.
A few seconds later, my automated system immediately erases your credit card number. For security reasons, I will never store credit card numbers. Nobody can "hack" into any of my computers to steal your credit card number simply because that information does not exist in my computers.
I will not sell or rent your personal information to anyone, nor share it in any other way, unless required to by a law enforcement agency that takes the proper steps to require it. In other words, I only supply personal information to the authorities after receiving a court order to do so.
