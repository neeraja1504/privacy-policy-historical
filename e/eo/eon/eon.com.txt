Data Privacy Statement - E.ON
Privacy Policy: I acknowledge the data protection policy. I agree that the cookies as mentioned in the data protection policy in section C are set for marketing purposes. I have read the details regarding cookies, in particular with regard to the duration of storage of the data and the content of the consent in the data protection policy. I can revoke the consent at any time. How this can be done, is written in the  Privacy Policy.
We, E.ON SE, Brüsseler Platz 1, 45131 Essen, as the data controller for the website eon.com pursuant to Art. 4 No. 7 EU GDPR (hereinafter “we”), are pleased to provide you with information through this data protection statement as to whether and to what extent your personal data is processed when visiting the website at this domain. In addition, we also hereby provide you information on your rights and identify relevant contacts. This information applies to the domain specified above as well as to other websites that we host online, if these are explicitly referenced in this statement.
Personal data includes all information that identifies you individually, e.g. name, address, email address, IP address, data about website use.
A. Processing of personal data from informational use based on legitimate interests, Art. 6(1) lit. f) GDPR
In case of purely informational use of our website, which means when you do not register, log in or otherwise transmit any additional information to us, we initially collect and process only the personal data that your browser and your internet provider transmit to our server. This involves data that is needed for technical reasons in order to display the website and to ensure the security and stability of our site.
Specifically, this is the shortened and thus anonymous IP address (the reduction excludes person-specific identifiers and thus, a personal relationship), the website, the site you last visited (referrer), the websites belonging to E.ON SE that you visited, the names of the retrieved files, the date and time of the retrieval, the operating system and version of browser installed on your PC. We also store the aforementioned data in log files. This occurs in order to ensure that the website functions properly. In addition, we use the data to improve our online presence and to ensure its security. However, none of the aforementioned data is stored together with other personal information. Log files are stored for a maximum of 7 days.
Technical data (shortened and hence anonymised IP address; date; time of the request; content of the request, i.e. specific site and files you might have accessed; access status/http status code);
Time zone difference to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT); amount of data transferred respectively; website from which the request originated;
Operating system/browser data (operating system, GUI, browser, language and version of the browser software.)
In order for the website to operate properly and to fulfil our own obligations, we forward your data to our service providers and in turn receive data from them. This is also applicable if you contact us in the ways specified by us (emails, forms, newsletters, chat inquiries, contests) or use other offers on our website.
B. Use of cookies based on legitimate interests, Article 6(1) letter a) GDPR
In addition to the data previously specified, when you visit our website, so-called “cookies” are saved to your computer. Cookies are small text files that are saved to a browser on your computer and are used by the entity that placed them there (i.e. us) to obtain certain information. Cookies cannot run programmes or place viruses on your computer. They serve generally to make the website more effective and user friendly.
When you visit our website for the first time or if no cookie is detected on your device, you will be notified of our use of cookies. In addition, we obtain your consent for storing certain cookies. You will find further explanations under C. When issuing the initial Cookie Notice and obtaining your consent, we refer to this Privacy Policy.
We use both transient and persistent cookies; the scope and functionality of each is described below:
1. Transient Cookies
Transient cookies are automatically deleted when you close your browser. This includes in particular session cookies. These store a so-called session ID, through which different requests of your browser can be assigned to the common session and make your surfing experience on our website a more pleasant one for you. Session cookies can be used to recognise your computer when you return to our website. Session cookies are automatically deleted when you close your browser.
2. Persistent Cookies
Persistent cookies are automatically deleted after a specified period, which can differ from one cookie to another. You can delete the cookies at any time using the security settings in your browser.
At no time will personal data be stored in a cookie.

Important:
You may configure your browser however you like so that it, for example, refuses to accept third-party cookies or any cookies. You should be aware, however, that such refusal may potentially prevent you from accessing all the website’s features or the site may not display at all.
C. Use of cookies based on your consent, Article 6(1) letter a) GDPR
If you have given us your consent by clicking on the "Accept" button in the cookie query, the following is applicable: In addition to the aforementioned use of cookies to operate our website, you have consented to the use of the following cookies for the purpose of personalised advertising:
1.     Cookie & Retargeting
The cookie allows us to collect and store anonymous information, such as: Device type, operating system, browser version, geographic location, URLs where our ad appears, or information about ad interactions (such as number of clicks or views) along with a time stamp of interaction. With retargeting, a device type can be detected that allows us to show ads that are potentially more relevant.

2.     Mouseflow
This website uses Mouseflow, a web analytics tool of Mouseflow ApS, Flaesketorvet 68, 1711 Copenhagen, Denmark, to collect randomly selected individual visits (using an anonymous IP address only). The mouse movements, mouse clicks and keyboard interactions are logged at random, along with the intention of individual visits to this site as so-called session replays to reproduce and evaluate the so-called heat maps and determine potential improvements for this site. The Mouseflow cookie will be deleted after 90 days. The data collected by Mouseflow are non-personal and will not be disclosed to third parties and will be stored for a period of 3 months.

3.     Google Analytics and Optimize
This website uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service from Google Inc. (“Google“). Google Analytics employs cookies that are saved to your computer and enable analysis of your use of the website. The information generated by the cookie on your use of this website is in general transmitted to a server in the US and stored there. Through IP anonymisation on this website, however, your IP address is first truncated by Google within the member countries to the European Union or in other signatories of the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional circumstances is the full IP address transferred to a Google server in the US and truncated there.
Use of IP address
Computers and devices connected to the Internet are assigned a unique number called an IP address. Because these numbers are typically assigned in country-based blocks, an IP address can often be used to identify the country (state or city) that connects to the Internet using a particular computer. Google Analytics captures the IP addresses of website visitors. This allows website owners to analyse which parts of the world their visitors come from. This method is known as geo-targeting by IP addresses.
The actual IP address information will not be shared with Google Analytics customers by Google Analytics. In addition, the IP masking method is used: Website owners who use Google Analytics can set it to use only part of the data for geo-targeting instead of the entire IP address. Website owners generally have access to the IP addresses of their website visitors, regardless of the use of Google Analytics.
The data collected through Google Analytics will be stored for a period of 50 months.
We use Google Analytics to analyze use of and to periodically make improvements to our website. Using the statistics acquired thereby, we are able to improve our website and make it more attractive to you as a user. Additionally we use the data  collected by Google Analytics in the Google tool Optimize. Together  with an additional cookie Optimize allows us to test different versions of a website and the response of users to these different versions. This enables us for example to test on which place within the website a certain information is most attractive. The additional cookie (…gaexp) is used to determine whether you are included in a test and the end of the test.
The data collected by this additional cookie will be stored for the length of the experiment, typically 90 days.
For those exceptional circumstances in which personal data is transmitted to the US, Google has agreed to be subject to the EU-US Privacy Shield
https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework. The legal basis for the use of Google Analytics is Art. 6(1) p. 1 lit. f GDPR.

4.     Google Tag Manager
This site uses Google Tag Manager. The Google tag Manager is a solution of Google Inc. and with this, the company can manage site tags over an interface. Google Tag Manager is a cookie-free domain that does not collect personally identifiable information. Google Tag Manager triggers other tags, which may collect data. We would like to explicitly point out that Google Tag Manager does not access this data. If the user has been deactivated at the domain or cookie level, the settings will remain the same for all tracking tags implemented using Google Tag Manager.
Objection to the Tracking
The permission to collect and store data may be revoked at any time with effect for the future. The website remains completely accessible after opposition. Clicking on the “Opt-Out of Tracking" button completely stops tracking. In order for the objection to persist for future visits, your browser must accept persistent cookies.

1.      Use of Social Media Plug-ins
(a)  We currently make use of the following social media plug-ins: Facebook, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Google+, Pinterest, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Xing. We use the so-called two-click approach. That means, when you visit our site, no personal data is initially transmitted to the plug-in provider. You can identify the plug-in provider by the first letter or logo on the label on the box. We provide you the opportunity to communicate directly with the plug-in provider using the button. Only when you activate the marked field by clicking on it will the plug-in provider be informed that you have accessed our online services on the website. According to Facebook, the IP address is anonymised on Facebook immediately after collection. Therefore, by activating the plug-in, your personal data is transmitted to the respective plug-in provider and stored there (for US providers: in the US). As the plug-in provider acquires the data primarily via cookies, we recommend you delete all cookies using the security settings on your browser before clicking on the greyed-out box.
(b)  We have no influence over either data collection or data processing operations, nor are we familiar with the full scope of data collection, the purposes of collection or retention periods. We also have no information on deletion of the collected data by the plug-in provider.
(c)  The plug-in provider stores data collected about you as a user profile and uses it for the purpose of advertising, market research and/or appropriate design of its website. This utilisation occurs in particular (including for users who are not logged in) in presenting appropriate advertising and to inform other social network users of your activities on our website. You are entitled to object to the creation of this user profile; to do so you must contact the respective plug-in provider. Using the plug-in we offer you the opportunity to interact with the social network and other users so that we can improve our site and design it so as to make it more attractive to you. The legal basis for the use of plug-ins is Art. 6(1) p. 1 lit. f GDPR.
(d)  Data transfer occurs independently of whether or not you have an account with the plug-in provider and are logged in. When you are logged into the plug-in provider, the data collected from us is assigned directly to your account with the plug-in provider. When you press the activated button and, for example, link to the website, the plug-in provider also stores this information and shares it publicly with your contacts. We recommend that you regularly log out after using a social network, particularly before activating the button in order to avoid this sort of association to your profile with the plug-in provider.
(e)  You can find additional information on the purpose and scope of data collection and its processing by the plug-in provider in the following data protection statements by these providers. There you will also find additional information regarding your rights and configuration options for safeguarding your personal privacy.
