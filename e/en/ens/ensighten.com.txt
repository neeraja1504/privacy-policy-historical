Ensighten Privacy Policy
Last Updated February 26th, 2019
PART I. GENERAL INFORMATION
Our commitment to privacy
Your privacy is important to us and maintaining your trust is our priority. To ensure that your privacy is protected and your privacy choices are respected, we have set out in this Privacy Policy an explanation of our online information practices as well as the decisions you may make regarding how your information is collected and used when viewing our websites and their sub-domains (the “ Websites “). We also describe in this Privacy Policy how we collect and use information in the course of providing tag management and data intelligence services (the “ Services “) to our customers.
Our principles
Ensighten adheres to industry best practice privacy principles with respect to our data collection practices. This includes data collection on our own Websites, including the Website that you are now visiting, as well as the websites that customers use to access the data we collect on the their behalf pursuant to their instructions when providing Services to them.
The key privacy principles that guide our use of data are:
Notice – Ensighten is committed to making information about our data collection practices readily available to you so that you can make informed decisions about your activities on our Websites (see the “What We Collect and How We Use It” section below). We encourage our customers to do the same when we collect data in the course of providing Services to them too.
Choice – Ensighten provides you with the opportunity to elect not to participate in certain data collection activities through our Websites (see the “ What We Collect And How We Use It” and “Unsubscribe from Our Mailing List” sections below).
Access – We provide all visitors to our Websites with the opportunity to access, review, modify, and delete any personal information that has previously been provided or collected (see the “Update and Access Your Information” section below).
PART II. WHAT WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT
Information we automatically collect when you use the Websites
We have designed the portions of the Websites which do not require password access so that visitors can navigate and view content without having to provide any directly identifying personal contact details to us, such as their name, address, e-mail or telephone number.
However, when you visit this Website, we collect certain information related to your device, such as your device’s IP address, referring website, what pages your device visited, and the time that your device visited our Website.
We will use this information:
to administer our Websites and for internal operations, including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research, statistical and survey purposes;
to improve our Websites to ensure that content is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your computer; and
as part of our efforts to keep our Websites safe and secure.
Information you give to us when using the Websites
We may also collect any personal information that you choose to send to us or provide to us on our online forms (such as our “Resume Submission” or “Request for Information” forms).
We will use this information for purposes made clear to you at the time you submit your information – for example, to fulfill your request for support, to provide you with information you have requested about our products and services, or to consider your application for employment.
We and our third party marketing partners may also use the information you send to us for our marketing purposes, if this is in accordance with your marketing preferences. However, you will always be able to opt-out of our marketing at any time (see the “ Unsubscribe from Our Mailing List ” section below).
What we collect from customers of Ensighten Services
If you are an Ensighten customer, then when your users access their data via our secure web interface, we collect certain device-related information about the way they use our Services, such as their IP address, the type of browser they are using, and the numbers and durations of site visits. We also collect user ID, username, and password.
We use the information that we collect to deliver and improve our Services, to relay administrative information, and to verify login information.
What we collect for customers when they use our Services
When you use websites owned or controlled by our customers that are using Ensighten Services, you may also be providing certain additional types of information to our customers other than those described above, such as tracking tags and cookies, or any data that our customers choose to collect, store and use.
By default, the Ensighten Services do not collect, store or use any directly-identifying information, such as names or addresses. In fact, we recommend and encourage our customers not to collect, store or use any such directly-identifying personal information in connection with our Services.
However, our Services will collect certain information about your device. In this context, we collect only the device-related information that our customers instruct us to collect as necessary to provide Services to them. In general, this will typically include certain network-related information, the device’s hardware model, operating system version, and browser type and version. We use this information to help our customers understand the general locale of their visitors, to provide analytics information to our customers about how visitors interact with their digital properties and to monitor, maintain, and improve our Services. We encourage our customers to disclose the use of our Services in their own privacy statements.
In all cases, whether and what personal information is collected, stored or used will ultimately depend upon the individual privacy practices of the customer website you visit. You should always check the individual privacy policy of each website you visit before providing any information. If you have any questions about how our customers collect, store or use your information, you should contact them directly.
Disclosure of information to third parties
As we continue to develop our business, we may sell certain parts of our business or our assets. In such transactions, visitor information is likely to be one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the event that Ensighten, Inc. or substantially all of its assets is acquired, our visitor information may be an asset that is reviewed and transferred by or to a third party. This means that if a third party buys Ensighten, Inc., a corporate group member or its assets, then we may disclose information to that third party in connection with the sale. We will make clear to the relevant third party purchaser that it should only use personal information it receives from us for the purposes for which it was originally obtained.
We may also disclose information where we believe necessary in order to protect the vital interests of any person, or exercise, establish or defend our legal rights. We may also request your consent to share your personal information with some third parties and, in this circumstance, we will only share your personal information with parties for whom you have consented.
Finally, we may forward to our service providers the information we collect about you, but only for the limited purpose of them providing a service to us, such as fulfilling on our behalf a request for information about Ensighten.
Part III. Your Privacy Rights

Security
