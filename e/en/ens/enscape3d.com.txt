Privacy - Enscape™
Data protection
We appreciate your visit to our website and your interest in our company and our products. In doing so, we respect your privacy and ensure the protection of your personal information by processing your personal information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy and the applicable privacy laws.
You can visit our websites without telling us who you are. In order to display our web pages, you are only obliged to provide the data transmitted to our server (see “Logfiles”) by your browser. Other personal information about you will only be stored if you voluntarily enter it on the website, or use the appropriate features, e.g. for entries via our contact or application forms.
Contact and other online forms
You may enter your personal information on our website to contact us or to order a trial version of our software. Only data, indicated with an asterisk, is data that is considered to be obligatory and that you are required to provide. Any additional data submitted may be helpful in processing your request, but it is not mandatory (optional). With your consent, these data will only be used and stored for the purpose of processing your message (Art. 6 Abs. 1 S. 1 lit. a DSGVO) or for carrying out your order/request (Art. 6 Abs. 1 S. 1 lit. b DSGVO).
When ordering a trial version, we also process personal data for marketing purposes within the framework of Art. 6 Abs. 1 S. 1 lit. f DSGVO. You may object to advertising use at any time with future effect.
Orders, customer account
To place an order, you must register as a customer. For registration, the data provided with an asterisk must be entered as mandatory information. We process this data for the purpose of carrying out your order and for the necessary communication with you, as well as to guarantee support (Art. 6 Abs. 1 S. 1 lit. b DSGVO). The specification of further data may be helpful for the processing of your order, but it is not compulsory (voluntary information, Art. 6 Abs. 1 S. 1 lit. a DSGVO). You can have your user account deleted by sending an e-mail to us under the contact details listed under “Responsible”. We carry out the deletion after termination of any existing contractual relationship, taking into account any existing statutory retention requirements. We also process your personal data for marketing purposes within the framework of Art. 6 Abs. 1 S. 1 lit. f DSGVO. You may object to advertising use at any time with future effect.
Webinars
You have the opportunity to participate in webinars or to book a webinar via our platform. For this, registration is required and the mandatory information, indicated with an asterisk, that is provided and is for the purpose of carrying out the event, is collected and processed; any further data provided outside the mandatory information required will be considered advantageous, but not mandatory (voluntary information). The legal basis for data processing is Art. 6 Abs. 1 S. 1 lit. b und a DSGVO. The event will be carried out via a technical platform of a technical service provider, which processes the personal data on our behalf. We use this data solely for the purpose of conducting the webinar (and any related billing purposes).
Forum
Our forum can be read without requiring registration. If you would like to actively participate in the forum, you must register yourself by entering your e-mail address, a password of your own choice, and your own username. There is no constraint placed in choosing a username, and the use of a pseudonymous is possible. You can complete your profile by volunteering further information or by providing a photo of yourself. These data (except for the e-mail address) will, with your consent, be publicly displayed in the forum for all other visitors (Art. 6 Abs. 1 S. 1 lit. a DSGVO).
When you sign up for a forum account, we’ll store all the information associated with your account, such as your public posts, likes, private messages, etc. that are required to run the forum, up until the time your account is deleted. The legal basis is Art. 6 Abs. 1 S. 1 lit. f DSGVO.
If you delete your account, your account will no longer be available and no profile will be visible to other users, but your public statements, in particular, contributions to the forum, will continue to be visible to all readers, but will be marked in the forum with ??? instead. All other data will be deleted.
Online application
By using the online application service you are leaving the Enscape website. Data processing, under the data protection law, is then no longer under the responsibility of Enscape GmbH, but under the responsibility of Personio GmbH. We can therefore not influence the type and scope of the data processing undertaken. You can apply to us in writing, as well as directly through our website. It is compulsory to provide information for data fields that are marked with an asterisk. The provision of further personal data may be helpful in processing your application, but is not mandatory (voluntary information). The legal basis for data processing is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b DSGVO (Initiation of Employment). You have the option of sending us your application document, such as a CV, certificates of qualifications, etc. confidentially by post. Alternatively, you can also send these documents directly over the Internet via the website’s online application, submitting the files in question which will be encrypted (TLS). Your information provided during the application process is processed by Personio on behalf of Enscape. Personio GmbH stores data exclusively on ISO-certified servers in Germany. Further measures to ensure compliance with data protection law are regulated under a contract for processing orders (Art. 28 GDPR). Any use for other purposes, or the passing on to any third parties (except the obligated after the DSGVO Dienstleister) does not take place, unless expressly agreed to by you (consent). Application documents are stored for the duration of employment with due observance of legal retention periods. In the event of cancellation, we will delete application documents no later than six months after the cancellation, or we will send the non-electronic documents back to you.
