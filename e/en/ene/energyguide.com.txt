Co-Branded and Private Label Partners

We use the IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to allocate load. IP addresses are also used in aggregate form for traffic analysis. When a person visits the site, a cookie is created on the user's machine that stores that visitor's user ID. The cookie persists on the user's machine for one year at which point it expires. A second cookie is also created to hold session information. It expires as soon as the session terminates (after twenty minutes).
