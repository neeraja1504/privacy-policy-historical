3.2 - USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION WHICH IS NECESSARY FOR OUR LEGITIMATE INTERESTS
Sometimes, our use of your personal information is for purposes which are ancillary to the provision of the Services, or which are desirable in order to make them operate more effectively. In those circumstances, we believe we have a legitimate interest in handling your data, and do not believe that this storage and use of your data will be of particular concern to you.
We use your personal information for our legitimate interests in the following ways:

to keep our Services secure;
to customise the Services which are available to you;

4 - WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION IS SHARED WITH OR ACCESSED BY THIRD PARTIES?
Enjin will share your personal information with various third parties (including our affiliate companies in other countries) as follows:
We use third parties to help us manage your information and the Services, such as our IT service providers, cloud service providers and customer service software and support ticketing providers. These are companies who are authorised to process data on our behalf only as necessary to provide the relevant services to us and cannot use it for their own independent purposes;
We share your data with our third party payment providers where you have asked us to complete any purchases using our Services. These third-party payment providers may also ask us to share your data with them to confirm the nature of any payment transaction and to verify your identity and payment details;

Any third parties with whom we share your personal information are limited (by law and by contract) in their ability to use your personal information for any purpose other than to provide services for us. We will always take reasonable steps to ensure that any third parties with whom we share your personal information are subject to privacy and security obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy and applicable laws.
We will also disclose your personal information to third parties:
where it is in our legitimate interests to do so to run, grow and develop our business, such as:
if we sell or buy any business or assets, we may disclose your personal information to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets;
if substantially all of our or any of our affiliates' assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal information held by us will be one of the transferred assets;

We may also disclose and use anonymised, aggregated reporting and statistics about users of our website or our goods and services for the purpose of internal reporting or reporting to our group or other third parties, and for our marketing and promotion purposes. None of these anonymised, aggregated reports or statistics will enable our users to be personally identified.
Save as expressly detailed above, we will never share, sell or rent any of your personal information to any third party without notifying you and, where necessary, obtaining your consent. If you have given your consent for us to use your personal information in a particular way, but later change your mind, you should contact us and we will stop doing so.
5 - THIRD PARTY ADVERTISING COMPANIES
We want to make sure that our advertising and marketing is relevant and interesting to you and our other users.
To achieve this, we use third-party advertising and technology companies to serve ads and/or provide aggregated data to assist in serving ads when you visit or use our Services. This includes third party technology companies which collect data about you in order to build a profile of your preferences based on your activities when you visit or use our Services. We also use these companies to automatically collect data from you when you use our Services in order to help us identify the ads that are served to you and what you do after seeing those ads. In addition, we share data with providers of web analytics tools, such as Google Analytics, which we use to analyse your use of the Services.
These third party advertising companies collect, store and use data by integrating cookies and other tracking software on our Services. The relevant data collected by these third parties includes a unique device ID, geo-location details and your assigned Enjin ID. Data which you provide to Enjin when using our Services may also be captured by these third parties.
In some cases these third parties will also use the data that they collect for their own purposes, for example they may aggregate your data with other data they hold and use this to inform advertising related services provided to other clients.
