Your obligations
It's important that you take reasonable care when answering any questions we ask by ensuring that all information provided is accurate and complete. If you carelessly provide false or misleading information to us, or to an insurer, it could adversely affect your policy and any claim. If you deliberately or recklessly provide false or misleading information the insurer will be entitled to treat your policy as if it never existed, decline all claims and take further legal action against you.
You must tell us about any change in your circumstances as soon as possible as this could affect your insurance cover.
How we use your information
Endsleigh and our selected third parties collect and use your information to meet our legal obligations, and for these legitimate business purposes :
quote for, provide or administer insurance or related products and services
process payments or refunds or arrange premium finance loans
record or process insurance claims
communicate with you about products you own or services you use
detect or prevent fraud and other crimes
verify your identity when you contact us or use our services

We keep the amount of information collected and the extent of any processing to the minimum to meet these legitimate business purposes.
Dealing with others acting on your behalf
We normally need your consent before we permit other people you trust to act on your behalf.
Sensitive personal information
Data protection legislation permits us to collect and use sensitive personal information (e.g. criminal convictions, health records, union membership and the time youâ€™ve been resident in the UK) without requiring your consent.
Keeping you informed
We will obtain your consent before contacting you by email, text, phone or post about products, discounts, rewards or competitions we think will interest you.
If you change your mind at any time and wish to withdraw your consent to this contact, you can either click the unsubscribe link in our emails or contact us.
Please note: We do not share your information for marketing purposes with anyone outside of the Endsleigh group of companies.
Credit checks for insurance quotations
When you ask us for an insurance quotation, we will ask a credit reference agency to provide your credit score, which you too can obtain from any credit reference agency. The information we receive as a result is based on public data including the edited electoral roll, county court judgements, Scottish decrees and bankruptcy registers. This quotation search is recorded by the credit reference agency but does not affect your credit score. You can find out further information about how the Credit Agencies collect and use personal data at www.callcredit.co.uk/crain.
When you ask us for an insurance quotation we will carry out anti-fraud checks to validate your application. We will search third party fraud prevention and detection databases, and if we suspect fraud, Endsleigh or insurers can decline to offer you insurance.
If you proceed to buy an insurance policy from Endsleigh, please be aware that these searches are conducted again when your policy is due for renewal. If you choose to pay by monthly Direct Debit, your details will be sent to a premium finance provider, or your insurer as appropriate, who will assess your application and may carry out additional credit and anti-fraud checks which could affect your credit score.
Higher education and professional association checks
Endsleigh maintains relationships with education related organisations and institutions, unions, professional bodies, charities and other employers. Endsleigh uses the personal information you provide, together with data from these organisations to refine the insurance quotes we provide.
Fraudulent claim detection and prevention
Insurers pass information to the Claims and Underwriting Exchange Register, run by Motor Insurers' Bureau (MIB) and the Motor Insurance Anti-Fraud and Theft Register, run by the Association of British Insurers (ABI). The aim is to help us check information provided and also to prevent fraudulent claims. When we deal with your request for insurance, we may search these registers.
Under the conditions of your insurance policy, you must tell us about any incident (such as an accident or theft) which may or may not give rise to a claim. When you tell us about an incident, we will pass information relating to it to the registers.
In order to prevent and detect fraud, we may at any time:
Share information about you with other organisations including the police
Conduct searches about you using publicly available databases
Undertake credit searches
Check and/or share your details with fraud prevention and detection agencies.
If false or inaccurate information is provided and fraud is identified, details will be passed to fraud prevention agencies. Law enforcement agencies may access and use this information.
Endsleigh and the insurer or other organisations may access and use this information to prevent fraud and money laundering, for example when:
Checking details on applications for credit and credit related or other facilities
Managing credit and credit related accounts or facilities
Recovering debt and tracing beneficiaries
Checking details on proposal and claims for all types of insurance
Checking details of job applicants and employees
The information recorded by fraud prevention agencies may be stored in other countries and used by the Insurer and other organisations from these countries.
Please contact us by email to policy.validation@endsleigh.co.uk if you want to receive details of the relevant fraud prevention agencies.
Motor Insurance Database
Information relating to your motor insurance policy will be added to the Motor Insurance Database (MID) managed by the Motor Insurerâ€™s Bureau (MIB). MID and the data stored on it may be used by certain statutory or authorised bodies including the police, the DVLA, the DVANI, the Insurance Fraud Bureau and other bodies permitted by law for purposes not limited to but including:
A) Electronic licensing
B) Continuous insurance enforcement
C) Law enforcement (prevention, detection, apprehension and or prosecution of offenders)
D) The provision of government services and or other services aimed at reducing the level and incidence of uninsured driving.
If you are involved in a road traffic accident (either in the UK, EEA or certain other territories), insurers and or the MIB may search the MID to obtain relevant information. Persons (including his or her appointed representatives) pursuing a claim in respect of a road traffic accident (including citizens of other countries) may also obtain relevant information which is held on the MID.
It is vital that the MID holds your correct registration number. If it is incorrectly shown on the MID you are at risk of having your vehicle seized by the police. You can check that your correct registration number details are shown on the MID at www.askmid.com. You can find out more about this from your insurer, or at www.mib.org.uk.
Who we share your information with
When necessary we will share your personal information with:
other companies in the Endsleigh group of companies, or companies affiliated to us
associated companies including insurance companies, premium finance providers and our other suppliers and service providers (for the purpose of the service they provide to us)
