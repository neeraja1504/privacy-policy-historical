www.loopd.com - Legal - Privacy Policy
The privacy practices of this statement apply to our services available under the domain and sub-domains of www.sponsorhouse.com and domains and subdomains that may be utilizing the services or modules of SponsorHouse.com. Please note that this Policy applies only to sites maintained by SponsorHouse.com and not to websites maintained by other companies or organizations to which we link. In addition, this Policy applies only to information collected by SponsorHouse online, not offline. By visiting our websites you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree please do not use or access our services.
SponsorHouse is committed to providing a safe and secure website for people of all ages. We are dedicated to safeguarding all personal information collected online. Because children may visit this website, we employ special measures to help children protect their privacy while online. We do not ask children to disclose more personal information than is necessary for them to participate in a particular activity, and we take steps to prevent children from posting contact information.  We urge children to check with their parents before entering information on any website and we urge parents to discuss with their kids restrictions regarding the online release of personal information to anyone they don’t know.
For purposes of this Privacy Policy (“Policy” or “Privacy Policy”), the terms “we,” “us,” “our” and
Loopd.com and “SponsorHouse.com” refer to SponsorHouse, Inc. d.b.a Loop’d Network, a Delaware corporation, and “you” and “your” refers to you, as a user of the SponsorHouse.com service. The Privacy Policy below governs your SponsorHouse.com account and any information you provide on this site.
A.  Overview:In order to operate the SponsorHouse.com service and to provide our services, including, but not limited to, matching Participants (more fully described below) with sponsors, sponsors with Participants, Participants with friends, fans, promoters, and businesses we must ask you to provide some information about yourself. SponsorHouse.com is committed to protecting the privacy of our users. We want to provide a safe, secure user experience. We will use our best efforts to ensure that the information you submit to us remains private, and is used only in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy applies to all information collected or submitted on the SponsorHouse.com website. We will not sell or rent your nonpublic personal information to third parties except as set forth in Part E below. As described in more detail in Part E below, there are limited circumstances in which some of your nonpublic personal information will be shared with third parties, so it is important for you to review this Privacy Policy. “Participants” shall include, but not be limited to, athletes, drivers, gamers, musicians, models, actors, entertainers and celebrities.
By using the SponsorHouse.com service, you expressly consent to our collection and use and disclosure of your personal information in the manner described in this Privacy Policy. If you object to your nonpublic personal information being transferred or used as described in this Privacy Policy, please do not register for the SponsorHouse.com service. This Policy may be revised over time as new features are added to the SponsorHouse.com service or as we incorporate suggestions from our account holders. Any material changes will be effective immediately. The amended Privacy Policy will always be posted on our website.
B.  What information of yours we collect:
CHILDREN UNDER 13
: Generally, we limit our collection of information from children to what is known as non-personally identifiable information (screen names, gender, state). This information is collected so kids can participate in activities (chat with athletes and celebrities, post messages) without giving unnecessary personal information. From time to time, however, we may request limited personally identifiable information (kid's email address and/or email address of parent or third party), as explained below, in order to conduct or offer other online activities (matching Participants with sponsors, sponsors with Participants, Participants with friends, fans, promoters, and businesses). SponsorHouse does not condition a kid’s participation in any of our online activities on the disclosure of more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. As explained below, we also collect from parents additional types of information (credit card and billing information) when they purchase memberships or products and offerings at our website.
We collect nonpublic personal information about you from the following sources:
* Information we may receive when you sign up to use our service, communicate with other users, communicate with us, enter into a contest, apply for or offer sponsorship, rate or rank photos and content, or purchase or sell a product or service through a SponsorHouse.com, such as your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, credit card number, type of computer and similar information.
* Information we may receive from forms and surveys on our site that we request you to complete in an effort to deliver to you the best possible site experience, such as information on your interests, your gender, your age, your likes and dislikes regarding the site and its content and other similar information.
In addition, we may receive information about you from other sources (such as service providers or third party sites linked to our site) for tracking and advertising purposes.
When a child under thirteen participates in an activity that requires the collection, retention, and use of personal information, we will also ask for a parent's e-mail address so that we can notify the parent that we have received personal information from their child. We also may ask for parental verification by accepting and verifying a valid credit card number. We do not knowingly collect names and e-mail addresses from children under thirteen without notifying the parent via e-mail and giving the parent the option to remove their child's e-mail address and other information from our database.
C.  How your information is used: We may use nonpublic personal information we collect about you in the following ways:
To provide the services you are requesting, route your order or inquiry entered on SponsorHouse.com to the applicable sponsor or website, respond to your requests, customize your experience on the SponsorHouse.com website and contact you regarding your account.
In the aggregate, to help us determine what is most beneficial for our users, and how we can continually create a better overall experience for you.
To measure and improve our customer service, and to investigate potential fraud and violations of this Policy or any other agreement we have with you. We may, over time, delete correspondence records with you if permitted by law.
We use a software technology called “cookies.” Cookies are small text files that we place in visitors’ computer browsers to store their preferences. Cookies themselves do not contain any personally identifiable information. We do use session cookies to ensure that visitors under the age of 13 provide a parental email address to assist with our compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. We do use cookies to determine how many visitors we have and how often they visit various sections of our site. Once you log out or close your browser, session cookies expire and no longer have any effect.
To notify you if you are a winner and to award you prizes that you may have won. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.
In the case of children using our website and services, we use parents' e-mail addresses to notify them when we have received personal information such as e-mail addresses from their children and to give parents the option to remove their child's name from our lists. Parents have the option to agree to the collection and use of their child's information without consenting to the disclosure of the information to third parties.
If you give us specific permission, we may use your nonpublic personal information to:
Make you aware of additional products and services that may be of interest to you or to contact you regarding site changes.   You can choose whether to receive some, all or none of these communications.
Post your resume and profile in our searchable database as you request, thereby making it available to search queries by other users of our site.
