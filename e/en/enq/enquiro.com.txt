Privacy Policy
Collection:
Contact information will be collected as part of the signup process, such as your e-mail address, name, company name and telephone number.
Use:
Users who submit a whitepaper download request are automatically signed up for Enquiro's e-newsletter. Subscribers can unsubscribe at any time.
Enquiro may, from time to time, use your contact information to inform you of other products or services available from Enquiro. Enquiro may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered.
Enquiro may include your web site information in aggregate data to conduct marketing and technical research designed to improve our products. Your data will never be used in such a way where either you or your web site would be identifiable.
Enquiro does not sell, rent or lease its lists to third parties. We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as handling the processing and delivery of mailings or surveys, processing transactions, or performing statistical analysis of our services. We will only provide those companies the contact information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information and are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.
The Privacy Officer is responsible for ensuring Enquiro's compliance with this policy and the Personal Information Protection Act.
Clients should direct any complaints, concerns or questions regarding Enquiro's compliance in writing to the Privacy Officer. If the Privacy Officer is unable to resolve the concern, the client may also write to the Information and Privacy Commissioner of British Columbia.
