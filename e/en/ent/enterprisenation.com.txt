SUMMARY
This page sets out what information we process when you hold an account with us as a small business owner or as an adviser. It needs to be read in conjunction with our Privacy Policy.
WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION WE HOLD
Contact Information: when you register for an account we collect your first and last name, username, password, email address and phone number.
Usage information: we collect usage information about you whenever you interact with our websites and services. This includes which webpages you visit, what you click on, when you perform those actions, what language preference you have, and so on.
Device and browser data: we collect information from the device and application you use to access our services. Device data mainly means your IP address, operating system version, device type, system and performance information, and browser type. If you are on a mobile device we also collect the UUID for that device.
Log data: our web servers keep log files that record data each time a device accesses those servers. The log files contain data about the nature of each access, including originating IP addresses, internet service providers, the files viewed on our site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system versions, device type and timestamps.
Information from third parties and integration partners: we collect your personal information from third parties if you give permission to those third parties to share your information with us or where you have made that information publicly available online.
Information from page tags: we use third party tracking services that employ cookies and page tags to collect data about visitors to our websites. This data includes usage and user statistics. Emails sent by us or by users through our services include page tags that allow the sender to collect information about who opened those emails and clicked on links in them.
Billing information: we require you to provide your billing details, a name, address, email address and financial information corresponding to your selected method of payment (e.g. a credit card number and expiration date or a bank account number). We use a third party payment gateway to collect, store and process billing information. We do not store this information and all payment pages use TLS technology.
Account settings: you can set various preferences and personal details on pages like your account settings page.
