Cookies
This section describes the information we collect about visitors to our Site. As noted above,  we do   not  track user activities outside of our Site, nor do we track the web activities of users when they are logged into our VPN Services.
We may use or engage others to use cookies, clear gifs, and similar technologies to understand how users access and use our Site. In general, you can browse our Site without telling us who you are or submitting any personal information. However, we collect the IP addresses of all visitors to our Site, as well as other related information such as page requests, browser type, operating system and average time spent on our Site. We use this information to help us understand Site activity and to monitor and improve our Site.
Cookies.  Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. There are two types of cookies: session-based and persistent-based cookies. Session cookies exist only during an online session; we use session cookies to allow our systems to uniquely identify you while you are logged in to your account at the Site. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or turned off your computer. We use persistent cookies to track aggregate and statistical information about user activity.
Disabling Cookies.  Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Site visitors who disable their web browsers’ ability to accept cookies will be able to browse the Site but certain Site features will not function.
Clear GIFs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs).  We or the third parties we engage may employ clear GIFs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs) to help us better manage content on the Site by among other things, tracking the activities of our Site visitors and compiling statistics about Site usage. Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages or within emails.
Third Parties.  We may engage third parties, such as Google Analytics, to track and analyze non-personally identifiable Site data. These third parties may use cookies and clear GIFs on our Site to collect, analyze, and generate reports on Site usage for us. We do not provide these third parties with any personal information that we have collected about you.
Security Measures We Have In Place
We use security measures that are consistent with industry standards to protect your personal information from loss, theft, misuse or unauthorized access or disclosure or destruction. All employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. In addition, access to user or subscriber personal information is restricted to those who need to know such information to perform their job functions.
Where appropriate, we use encryption, access controls, passwords, and/or physical security measures to protect the personal information we collect and maintain about you against unauthorized access and disclosure. Despite our efforts, no data security methods guarantee 100% protection. We do not promise and cannot guarantee that your personal information can never be viewed and/or used by others.
Emails
We may send you marketing and promotional emails about products, services and other information we think may interest you. You may unsubscribe from such emails at any time by emailing us at support@entertainmentbox.com and telling us you would like to “unsubscribe from marketing emails.” In addition, if you receive a marketing or promotional e-mail from us, you may click the unsubscribe link contained in the e-mail to “opt out” of receiving future promotional e-mails from us.
