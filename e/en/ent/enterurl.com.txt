1. What Personally Identifiable Information Does EnterURL Collect?
In general, you can visit EnterURL.com on the Web without telling us who you are and without revealing any information about yourself. There are times, however, when we, or our Service partners, may need information from you in order to provide the requested Services. EnterURLâ€™s primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you with the best and most useful Services. EnterURL collects personally identifiable information when a Customer provides it to us, such as when you subscribe to Services, complete a survey, update your profile on our Web site, use certain Services, respond to our emails, and when you visit the EnterURL Web sites.

Also, when we collect personal data from you in connection with a transaction we may extract some information about that transaction in an anonymous format and combine it with other anonymous information. This anonymous information is used and analyzed only at an aggregate level to help us understand trends and patterns.
