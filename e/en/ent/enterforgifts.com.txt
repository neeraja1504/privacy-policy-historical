EnterForGifts.com understands how important your privacy is to you, so we are committed to assuring your privacy. This Privacy Policy ("policy") tells users ("you" or "applicant") of the website and the services provided therein about the information collected and how we use and share this information. Please keep in mind that through our website, you may be interacting with third parties that operate under their own privacy and security policies. This policy only addresses our website. Other sites accessible through our website and companies to whom your information is transferred have their own privacy policies and disclosures. Please consult each website’s privacy policy. We are not responsible for the policies of third parties.
What information do we collect?
EnterForGifts.com collects two types of information about our users: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information.
Personally Identifiable Information
EnterForGifts.com collects several types of information that may identify a particular individual ("personally identifiable information"). We collect personally identifiable information when you provide it to us through your use of our website, such as by sending questions to us via the website or email. The type of personally identifiable information we collect include: name, email address.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information
Non-personally identifiable information refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual. We gather certain information about you based upon where you visit on our website in several ways. This information is compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis. This information may include the website's Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") that you just came from, which URL you next go to, what browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. A URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web. An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol ("TCP/IP") network, such as the World Wide Web. Networks like the Web use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address of the destination. In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the web, allowing web servers to locate and identify your computer. Computers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet.
Information Collected by Third Parties
We may allow third parties, including advertising partners to display advertisements on our website. These companies may use tracking technologies, including cookies, to collect information about users of our website who view or interact with these advertisements.
