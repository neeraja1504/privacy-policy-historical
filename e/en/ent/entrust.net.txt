Disclosure to Third-Party Service Providers. We may contract with various third parties and provide your Personal Information to those parties. For example, we use a third-party to process payments made to us, and may subcontract out manufacturing, fulfillment, or other operations.

However, we cannot guarantee and are not liable for the conduct of such third parties.
Disclosure of Non-Personal Information. We will disclose Non-Personal Information, usually in aggregate form, to potential strategic partners, advertisers, investors, customers, and others.
