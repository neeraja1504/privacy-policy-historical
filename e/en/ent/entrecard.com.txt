By using or accessing our sites, you are accepting the practices described in this privacy policy. Please read it carefully. From time to time, we may need to change this privacy policy in order to address new issues and reflect changes on our sites. We will post those changes here so that you will always know what types of information we collect, how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose that information to anyone else. Please refer back to this policy regularly.

Scope of Privacy Policy
This privacy policy applies to your use of all of the sites and services owned or operated by Entrecard.com, and affiliated companies (collectively "Entrecard" or "we," "us," or "our"), including www.Entrecard.com and any other site that we own or operate (collectively, the "Entrecard Sites"). Unless we say otherwise, all references to the Entrecard Sites in this policy include all such sites.
Please note, however, that this policy does not apply to your use of unaffiliated sites that you may access through links provided on the Entrecard Sites.
Information We Collect and How We Use It
When you use the Entrecard Sites, you provide us with two types of information: personal information you choose to share and non-personal information we gather as you interact with the Entrecard Sites.
Personal Information: When you register with the Entrecard Sites, you provide us with certain personal information, such as your name, account password and email address. We will only use such information for the purposes for which it was requested, such as for site administration, to protect your account from unauthorized access, and to contact you when necessary.
On a voluntary basis, you may choose to share additional personal information when using the Entrecard Sites, such as by customizing your profile, adding a photo, posting reviews or comments, sending messages and performing searches. Please remember that any such personal information you disclose in this way becomes public information to the extent you choose to allow other users access to it. You should exercise caution when deciding whether and what types of information you wish to disclose. All such sharing of information is done at your own risk. We collect and retain this personal information or profile data so that you can utilize the unique personalized features of the Entrecard Sites. We may also use such information or data to understand how our users as a group utilize the services and resources provided on the Site, to track the demographics of our users and to collaborate with partners and advertisers. In the event, such information is disclosed to partners and advertisers it will only be in the form of aggregate data which does not describe or identify any individual user.
When you register with Entrecard, you create your own profile. They are displayed to people to enable you to connect with others on Entrecard. From time to time, we may use your name and email address to send you notifications regarding updates or new services offered by Entrecard that we think you may find valuable.
If you send the Entrecard Sites an electronic mail transmission, the email transmission is not necessarily secure and is not encrypted. Accordingly, email transmissions are not necessarily protected from unauthorized access. Transmission of email is at your own risk. We cannot accept responsibility for your transmission of personal information or any obligation with respect to that information not submitted over the secure server.
The Entrecard Sites allow its users to change or correct personal information previously provided. Please note, however, that even after modification or removal, residual copies of such information may remain on back-up media and may still be viewable in cached and archived pages or if other users have copied or stored the information.
We will not sell, rent, swap, share or otherwise disclose your personal information to third parties for commercial purposes, with the exception of the following: If Entrecard enters into a joint venture with or is sold to or merged with another business entity, we may disclose and/or transfer your personal information to our business partners or new owners. Under these limited circumstances, your information may be sold as part of Entrecard's assets and for the purpose of allowing the new owner to continue Entrecard's operations. In any such transfer of information, your information would remain subject to the promises made in any pre-existing privacy policy.
We may disclose your personal information to third parties if required to do so to comply with legal process or requirements, or to protect the rights, property or personal safety of others, including in the interests of fraud detection and prevention and credit risk reduction or abuses of the Entrecard service.
If we propose to use personal information for any purposes and in a manner different than those described in this policy, then we will ask for your consent prior to such use and give you an opportunity to opt out of such use for those other purposes.
Non-Personal Information: We also collect non-personal information through the use of "cookies" (small text files that reside on your hard drive) and/or IP address tracking. Non-personal information might include the URL, the browser, the type of computer, the operating systems, and the Internet service providers you use, and other similar information. Our system also automatically gathers information about the areas you visit on our sites and about the links you select from within our sites to other areas of the World Wide Web or elsewhere online.
We use such non-personal information in the form of aggregate data (which does not describe or identify any individual user) to understand how our users as a group utilize the services and resources provided on our sites. This way we know which areas of our sites are favorites of our users, which areas need improvement, and what technologies are being used so that we may continually improve our sites.
