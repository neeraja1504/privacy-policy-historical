Subsidiaries
We share the information that we collect from and about you with our subsidiaries for the purpose of providing the transactions you have requested and (with your consent) for marketing purposes. See the Subsidiaries page for a list.  The list is subject to change from time to time and you should periodically review it for changes. Our subsidiaries' employees in our IT, marketing, operations and customer service divisions will use your information, as described in this Privacy Policy, including, if required by applicable law, to send you information about products and services or respond to your enquiry.
Franchisees
The nature of the business and operations require us to share your reservation and booking information with our franchisees ("Franchisees").  See the Franchisees page for a list. The list is subject to change from time to time and you should periodically review it for changes.  For these transactions, the Franchisee is an independent data controller or equivalent under applicable law and will maintain its own privacy policy in respect of the rental data that you provide to the Franchisee. You are encouraged to check the privacy policy of the Franchisee that is applicable to your transaction.
To identify who is the data controller or equivalent under applicable law in respect of your personal information, visit the Contact Us page.
Fulfilment Providers
We may use a fulfilment provider to carry out your rental car transaction. For example, if you make a reservation for a car and driver in countries that require a driver, we will send your reservation information to the fulfilment provider in those countries. **** Where car and driver services are made available for you to reserve, these services are fulfilled by the company disclosed at the time of reservation.  While made available through our branded websites, these companies are independent operators.
For these transactions, the fulfilment provider is an independent data controller or equivalent under applicable law and will maintain its own privacy policy in respect of the rental data that you provide to the provider. You are encouraged to check the privacy policy of the provider that is applicable to your transaction.

Sale, Merger or Change in Control
Your information may also be transferred to another company in the event of a transfer, change of ownership, reorganisation or assignment of all or part of Enterprise Holdings' businesses or assets. This will occur if the parties have entered into an agreement under which the collection, use and disclosure of the information is limited to those purposes of the business transaction, including a determination whether or not to proceed with the business transaction.
