Introduction
Resumes are deeply personal documents which reveal a lot about you. Enhancv values your privacy, so we've developed an easy to understand Privacy Policy that covers how we collect and use your information.
Depending on your relationship with Enhancv, this info may include usage information, log information, account or billing information, payment details, contact information. You can understand when we collect and how we treat each type of data in the sections below.
When we refer to “we” and “us”, we mean Enhancv Ltd. which controls the information collected when you use our services on the Enhancv platform (also called "service", “product” within this document) to create your resume (or, as better known in other parts of the world, a CV) or any other document.
Keep in mind we never share the information you provide with third parties, except for chosen partners that are used for the purpose of providing you with a stable and enjoyable experience when using Enhancv. We have tried to outline here the main points of how these partners and third party services collect and use data, but for the most detailed and up-to-date information you should review their own privacy policies.
You always remain in control of your data. You may edit or erase your data from our services at any time or ask us to update or erase information we store, as long as this erasure is not in conflict with any legal obligations we may hold to national and international regulators.
By providing us with your data, you warrant to us that you are over 13 years of age. If this is not the case, you need to contact us immediately to delete any personally identifiable information from our records.
Depending on your relationship with Enhancv, we’d collect different types of information, as outlined below.
Usage information
What is it?
When visiting one of our domains, we will collect information about your interaction with the site, like pages you visit and specific actions you take like signing up or sharing one of our resume examples.
When using the Enhancv platform for creating your resume, we will collect information about the way our platform is used, including features used, resume sections used, number of resumes created, design elements used, etc. All information you knowingly include in your resume, including email, address, telephone number, is also stored in our database.
This information is collected in combination with data like user location, Internet browser type, device, operating system, your language preference, or the referring website you came to us through.
If, during the usage of Enhancv, you decide to take advantage of our Invite Friends feature and decide to invite friends by email, we will collect and store the email addresses of those friends in order to show you whether they have subscribed through your link or not, to provide you with the option of resending the invitation and to remind you which of your friends you’ve already invited. In all other cases when using the feature (e.g. sharing the link on social media or as a link in direct messaging platforms), we will only collect referral data, showing us a person came through your invite link, so that we can assign your earned credit.
How do we use it?
Usage information is used primarily in aggregate for statistical purposes. It helps us understand which parts of our product are of greatest interest and also provides information used to improve our platform and develop exciting new features. This information is shared with our third-party analytics services (including Google Analytics, Amplitude, Intercom and Attribution App). Those services operate either within the EU or in accordance with the EU-US Privacy Shield, ensuring the secure transfer of information.
Resume content is stored for the purpose of providing you with the primary service of Enhancv - creating, storing, displaying, and rendering your resume. This information is stored in JSON format in mLab database hosting.
Information about your invited friends is sent to Mandrill for the purpose of sending out the email invitations.
Data retention
Usage information stored in Google Analytics is kept up to 26 months after your last visit and afterwards used only in aggregate reports. Usage information in Amplitude, Intercom, and Attribution App is kept for an indefinite period of time and used only in aggregate to analyze usage patterns.
Resume content is stored for the duration of that resume being kept on our platform. If you delete your resume or delete your account, all resume content is instantaneously removed from our database.
Information about invited friends is kept within the Mandrill platform for 30 days after email sendout.
Log information
What is it?
Log data contain data about the nature of each access of our services, including originating Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and endpoint (the requested files on our platform), as well as timestamps for this activity. Web servers usually keep log files that record data each time a device accesses those servers.
We will also collect error logs which may collect more system data needed to fix known platform bugs.
How do we use it?
Log data is used to analyze platform usage, improve performance and eliminate any bugs. We primarily look at this information in aggregate, but we might review individual logs when looking for the cause of a specific issues. This may happen either by our own initiative or in relation to a request you log with our customer success team.
Only a small part of our engineering team has access to the full platform logs.
Data retention
Log data stored on our platform is kept for an indefinite period of time to help us review potential recurrence of bugs and user issues, and to monitor any attempts for unauthorised access to our services.
Account information
What is it?
When you create an account on the Enhancv platform, you may register with your name, email address and a password you choose. Those are stored in our platform.
If you choose to register by using a third-party account (LinkedIn or Facebook), we receive your personal information (name, profile photo, email, and work experience information that can be included in your resume) from third parties if you give permission to those third parties to share your information with us. Your password for those third-party services is never shared with us.

We analyze and review payment trends with the help of Baremetrics. Information contains name, user email addresses, information about plan types and sums paid.
How do we use it?

Aggregate information about payments is used with statistical purposes and to execute our legitimate interest of making our business more sustainable.

We store billing information and a full history of your payments even if you cancel your subscription or delete your account. This is part of our legal obligation to keep transaction records for local or international authorities. We also store your IP address together with your invoice data, so that we pay tax accordingly and comply with European Tax Law.
We never receive or store any payment details - they are kept with our payment partners. For further information you may refer to Braintree’s privacy policy.

What is it?
If you contact us with a question, through any of our communication channels, like our Help Center, email, or through our social media accounts on Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn, we will receive and store your contact details, like email, name, or social media account link.
In the case of support queries, we might need additional information to help you with your request - this will depend on the nature of your query and issue at hand. We will aim to ask for the minimal additional information needed to solve your request.
You may also provide us with your contact details when subscribing to our newsletter or product news list. We might also collect information about categories of interests you provide us with, such as what types of content do you want to receive from us.
How do we use it?
We use your contact information to communicate regarding your query, in the case of support request, or to send you product updates and helpful materials that will help you get the most of Enhancv and create a resume you’re proud of.

You can unsubscribe from both types of communication - you will find an unsubscribe link in the footer of each promotional email we send out. You can also manage those settings from your Enhancv Account. All our email communication is managed through our partners Intercom.
If you are a registered user of our platform, we will continue sending high priority information about your account, billing status, changes to our terms of service and other important topics. This information is an integral part of providing you our service and is managed either through Intercom or Mandrill. If you delete your account, you will stop receiving further communication from us.
Data retention
