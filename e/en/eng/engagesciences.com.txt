Wayin provides marketing products and services to, and processes certain personal data on behalf of, its Clients. We provide our Clients access to our marketing campaign development and management platforms and related products, applications and services (in each case in whatever format they may be offered now or in the future, the “ Platform ”).

The Website and Platform are collectively referred to herein as the “ Wayin Services.” Except as expressly described in the “Client Services” section below, this Privacy Policy does not apply to our Clients, or your use of the Client Services or Client Properties.

In some cases, this includes information such as “Likes”, basic profile information gathered from social networking sites or the fact that you viewed or interacted with our content.
To identify representatives of businesses that may be interested in our products and services, we obtain contact details from social networks, such as LinkedIn and Twitter, as well as business-to-business marketing lead providers, such as DiscoverOrg and Lusha Systems Limited.

We use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer or mobile device until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site. We also use pixel tags or web beacons, which are small images that allow us to determine the number of people who open our emails and information such as when and how many times the email was viewed, whether any links were clicked on, whether the email was forwarded, your approximate geographic location and browser and device type.

for social media integration e.g. via third-party social media cookies, or when you share information using a social media sharing button or “like” button on our Site or you link your account or engage with our content on or through a social networking website such as Facebook or Twitter; and
for the purpose of displaying advertisements via retargeting or other advertising platforms to those users who have visited our Site.
Note, where permitted by applicable law, some of these technologies can be used by us and/or our third-party partners to identify you across platforms, devices, sites, and services. We will seek consent, where required by law, to place any non-essential cookies on your computer or mobile device. Further, Clients may use additional cookies or other technologies as part of the Client Services that are not covered by this Privacy Policy.

When you use the Wayin Services, subject to applicable law we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal data upon your request and either provide you the means to correct this information if it is inaccurate, or to delete such information at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes.

11. Security
The security of your personal data is important to us. We maintain a variety of appropriate technical and organizational safeguards to protect your personal data.

Therefore, while we strive to use reasonable efforts to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

in limited circumstances, where you give us your consent ; and
for compliance with a legal or regulatory obligation that we are subject to : see also 6.8 above.
Special categories of personal data

For example, depending on the circumstances we are required to keep basic information about our customers (including contact, registration, and financial information) for six years after they cease being customers for tax purposes.
In some circumstances we will anonymize your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) in which case we can use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
