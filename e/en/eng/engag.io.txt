Legal Basis for Processing Personal Information (for EEA visitors)
If you are an individual from the European Economic Area, our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.
However, we will normally collect personal information from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our or a third party’s legitimate interests (and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms).  In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you.
If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contact with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information). Similarly, if we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.
If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us using the details at the end of this Privacy Policy.
International Transfers
If you are visiting our website or using our Services from outside the United States (U.S.), please be aware that you are sending personal information to the U.S. where our servers are located. The U.S. may not have data protection laws that are as comprehensive or protective as those in your country of residence. However, our collection, storage, and use of your personal information will at all times be in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
EU-U.S. Privacy Shield
In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Engagio, Inc. commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information.
Residents of the European Union who believe that their information has not been processed in compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles may raise their complaint in a number of ways:
(1) You can contact us directly using the contact details provided at the end of this Privacy Policy and we will respond to your complaint within 45 days of receipt.
(2) We have further committed to cooperate and comply with the panel of the European data protection authorities (DPAs) as our independent recourse mechanism in the resolution of your Privacy Shield complaint. If you are unsatisfied with the response you have received from us, or your complaint remains unresolved, you can contact your local DPA (contact details available here), and they will investigate your complaint free of charge.
(3) Further, your complaint may be referred to the U.S. Department of Commerce or the FTC for further investigation;
(4) If your complaint is not resolved through the above methods, a binding arbitration process may be available under the Privacy Shield in certain circumstances. To find out more about the Privacy Shield’s binding arbitration scheme, please see this article.
If we have received your personal information in the U.S. under the Privacy Shield, and subsequently transfer that information to a third party agent or service provider for processing, we will be responsible if our third party agent or service provider fails to process your personal information in compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles and this causes you harm.
Your Rights
Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal information. You have the right to:
to request access to a copy of the personal information we hold about you, or to request the correction, amendment, or deletion of such information;
to object to, or request a restriction of, processing of your personal information;
to request transfer of your personal information, to you or to a third party;
to withdraw consent for further processing of your personal information (in cases where our use of your personal information is based on your consent);
to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority (though we encourage you to contact us first with any questions or concerns).
To make a request relating to the exercise of your data protection rights, please contact us using the contact details provided at the end of this Privacy Policy. We will consider and respond to your request in accordance with the Privacy Shield Principles and applicable laws.
Furthermore, we commit to giving you an opportunity to opt-out if your personal information is to be disclosed to any other independent third parties, or to be used for a purpose materially different from those that are set out in this Privacy Policy. Where sensitive personal information is involved, we will always obtain your express opt-in consent to do such things. If you otherwise wish to limit the use or disclosure of your personal information, please write to us at the contact details below.
You can also unsubscribe from our marketing communications at any time by following the instructions or unsubscribe mechanism in the email message itself.
Data Retention

You can ask to close your account by contacting us at the details above, and we will delete your personal information on request.
