In order to fully understand your rights, we encourage you to read this Privacy Statement and to consult our Terms and Conditions (the “Terms”).
This Privacy Statement (together with the Terms and any other documents referred to) sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us. Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it. If you are under 16 years of age, please read this Privacy Statement with a parent or guardian to make sure you understand it.
For the purpose of the Data Protection Acts 1988-2003, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (EU) 2016/679 and any national implementing legislation (the “applicable Data protection law”), Engineers Ireland is the Data Controller.

If you contact us for any reason, we may keep a record of that correspondence for as long as it is necessary regarding the nature of your contact.

3. Where we store your personal data
All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.
The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. In all such cases Engineers Ireland will only transfer such data where there is an adequate level of data protection in that country that is no less protective than that which is provided in Ireland.
4. How we use your information
We use information held about you:
To ensure that content from our Website is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your computer;
To provide you with information, products or services that you request from us or which we feel may interest you, where you have consented to be contacted for such purposes or where it is in the legitimate interests of Engineers Ireland to provide you with this information;
To carry out our obligations arising from any contracts entered into between you and us;
To allow you to participate in interactive features of our Website;
To notify you about changes to our Website and/or services.
We may also use your data to provide you with information about our goods and services which may be of interest to you (e.g. CPD Courses, publications) and we or our agents may contact you about these by post, email and telephone. You are free to unsubscribe and opt-out of this communication at any time and we will always provide you with a way of doing so. If you are happy for us to use your data in this way please tick the relevant boxes when we collect your contact preferences.
If you are an existing customer, we will only contact you (such as email, voicemail or SMS) with information about goods and services similar to those which were the subject of a previous transaction with you.
We do not, without your consent, disclose information about identifiable individuals to third parties, but we may send anonymised statistical data to them for research and survey purposes. We may also use such information to help advertisers reach the kind of audience they want to target (for example, those in the engineering profession). We may make use of the personal data we have collected from you to enable us to comply with our advertisers’ wishes by displaying their advertisement to that target audience. We use Google analytics – information on this can be obtained at www.google.com/analytics.
Engineers Ireland does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties.
Engineers Ireland may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party. In addition, Engineers Ireland may share data with trusted partners to help us perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to Engineers Ireland, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.
Engineers Ireland does not gather special category data, such as race, religion, or political affiliations, from you.
The Engineers Ireland Website will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:
(a) conform with a legal obligation;
(b) protect and defend the rights or property of Engineers Ireland; or
(c) to protect the personal safety of users of Engineers Ireland, or the public.
5. Disclosure of your information
We may disclose your personal information to our subsidiaries or data processers working directly on our behalf for a specified purpose, for example, an external event management company obtaining delegate registrations for our annual conference. They do not keep this information and it is only used for the purpose we contract them for. We may disclose your personal information to third parties if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our Terms and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Engineers Ireland, our members, or others.
6. Safeguarding your personal information
We endeavour to use appropriate security measures at all times to protect your data. The Website has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. These security measures include SSL certificates to ensure encrypted data is received as it was sent, cookies and secure servers not accessible from anywhere but the Engineers Ireland Virtual Private Network (VPN). However, as no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed as 100% secure, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you transfer the data at your own risk
7. Cookies

To recognise you when you return to our site.
You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the setting on your browser which allows you to refuse the setting of cookies. However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of the Website or unable to avail of any of our services. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you log on to our site.
