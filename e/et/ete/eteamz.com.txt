Click here to review the Children's Privacy Policy
eteamz is committed to safeguarding your privacy online. We have posted this privacy policy to help you understand how your personal information will be treated as you use and enjoy our web Site. This policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically.
Collection of Information
As you navigate the Site, eteamz or its affiliates may be collecting or tracking personal information, either by asking you to tell us something about yourself (for example, when you input your name, address, and email address during the registration process), or by using data-tracking software that tells us what advertisements or parts of the Site have been of interest to you. Information about your activities may also be collected on an aggregate (i.e., group) basis, where we will not know or keep track of precisely who you are. eteamz or its affiliates may use this information, personal and aggregate, to tell you and other users about products or services that may be of interest to you; this information may also be shared with other parties from whom we believe you may want to receive information. Personal information may also be used to contact you again, either by electronic communication (such as email) or by regular mail or telephone. The more information you volunteer, the better we can create a personalized experience at eteamz and tailor our services to your needs.
Please be aware that advertisements displayed on the eteamz Site or third party web sites which are linked from the eteamz Site may also collect information about you. The information practices of those advertisers and web sites often are outside of our control and are not covered by this privacy policy.
Active has established and maintains reasonable security procedures to protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of your personally identifiable information. We use a variety of industry-standard security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information. For example, credit card numbers are encrypted in Active's secure database which is located behind a firewall. Personal information and such encrypted credit card numbers collected on Active are stored in a secure operating environment that is not available to the public. All credit card and registration information supplied by users is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. Active's technology department conducts frequent site-security audits. "Perfect security," however, does not exist on the Internet. Although your privacy is very important to us, due to the existing legal regulatory and security environment, we cannot fully ensure that your private communications and other personally identifiable information will not be disclosed to third parties. For example, Active will disclose personal information about an individual user if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to comply with an applicable law or valid legal process.
Cookies
As part of our ongoing effort to personalize our Site and our services, eteamz uses cookies to store and retrieve information about you and your usage of the Site.

Registration Data is the property of eteamz. eteamz maintains a secured area on the Site for transmission of Registration Data, and stores all Registration Data in a database that is subject to industry standard security protection. eteamz may sell, rent, share, swap or otherwise disclose your Registration Data to any third party unless you select the "opt out" option as described above. eteamz reserves the right to use your Registration Data to send you information about eteamz, the site, eteamz products and services, and other topics in which you have indicated an interest, whether or not you opt out of having your data provided to third parties or eteamz affiliates.
