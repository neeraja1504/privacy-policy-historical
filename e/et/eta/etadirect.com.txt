TOA has the individual’s permission to make the disclosure;
The disclosure is required by law or mandatory professional standards;
The disclosure is reasonably related to the sale or other disposition of all or part of TOA’s business;
The information in question is publicly available;
The disclosure is reasonably necessary for the establishment of legal claims; or The disclosure is to another TOA subsidiary, affiliate, or to persons or entities providing services on TOA’s or the individual’s behalf (each a “transferee”), consistent with the purpose for which the information was obtained, if the transferee, with respect to the information in question: is subject to law providing an adequate level of privacy protection; has agreed in writing to provide an adequate level of privacy protection; subscribes to the Safe Harbor Principles.
If TOA does disclose information to a third party, it will comply with the notice and choice principles as described above for all data which is disclosed or transferred to a third party.

6. Access – An individual may make a request to TOA for access to the information TOA maintains in its information products.
