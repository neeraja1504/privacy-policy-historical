Your Rights and Choices
We strive to provide you with choices regarding the personal information you provide to us. This section describes your rights and explains how to exercise those rights.
Access to Specific Information and Data Portability Rights
You have the right to request that Ethan Allen disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request (see Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights), we will disclose
the categories of personal information we collected about you;
the categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you;
our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that personal information;
the categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information;
the specific pieces of personal information we collected about you (also called a data portability request); and
if we sold or disclosed your personal information for a business purpose, two separate lists disclosing
sales, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient purchased; and
disclosures for a business purpose, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient obtained.
Deletion Request Rights
You have the right to request that Ethan Allen delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request (see Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights), we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.
We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to do any of the following:
Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you.
Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.
Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.
Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law.
For residents of California only, comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code § 1546 et. seq.). Under California Civil Code sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to ask us for a notice describing what categories of personal information we share with third parties or corporate affiliates for those third parties or corporate affiliates' direct marketing purposes. That notice will identify the categories of personal information shared with third parties and used for direct marketing purposes and the name and address of the third parties that received such personal information. If you are a California resident and want a copy of this notice, please submit a written request to the following address: Ethan Allen Client Services, P.O. Box 1966, 25 Lake Avenue Extension, Danbury, CT 06811. In your request, please specify that you want a "Your Ethan Allen California Privacy Rights Notice." Please allow 30 days for a response. If you are a minor under 18 and have a profile on ethanallen.com, you may ask us to remove reviews or other content that you posted on the site by writing to customerservice@ethanallen.com. We will begin to process your request within 30 days. Please note that processing your request does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of content that you posted.
Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information's deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research's achievement, if you previously provided informed consent.
Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us.
Comply with a legal obligation.
Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.
Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights
To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us.
Call us at 888-324-3571, if in the U.S.; at 877-386-9741, if in Canada.
Email us at customerservice@ethanallen.com or CanadaCS@ethanallen.com.
Only you, or, for California residents only, a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.
You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must
provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are either the person about whom we collected personal information or that person’s authorized representative; and
describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.
Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. However, if you maintain an account, we may contact you to verify your request. If you do not maintain an account with us, you may be required to bring a government-issued ID to one of our locations in order to verify your request.
We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.
For instructions on exercising sale opt-out rights, see Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights.
Response Timing and Format
We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.
If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, according to your preference.
Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request's receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily usable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance, specifically PDF format or paper copy.
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights
If you are 16 years of age or older, you have the right to direct us to not sell your personal information at any time (the "right to opt out"). We do not sell the personal information of consumers we actually know are less than 16 years of age, unless we receive affirmative authorization (the "right to opt in") from either the consumer who is between 13 and 16 years of age, or the parent or guardian of a consumer less than 13 years of age. Consumers who opt in to personal information sales may opt out of future sales at any time.
To exercise the right to opt out, you (or your authorized representative) may submit a request to us by calling 888-324-3571 or emailing customerservice@ethanallen.com (877-386-9741 or CanadaCS@ethanallen.com if in Canada).
Once you make an opt-out request, we will wait at least twelve (12) months before asking you to reauthorize personal information sales. However, you may change your mind and opt back in to personal information sales at any time by calling 888-324-3571 or emailing customerservice@ethanallen.com (877-386-9741 or CanadaCS@ethanallen.com if in Canada).
You do not need to create an account with us to exercise your opt-out rights. We will only use personal information provided in an opt-out request to review and comply with the request.
There are other mechanisms in place to provide you with control over your information:
Tracking Technologies and Advertising. You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this site may then be inaccessible or may not function properly.
Promotional Offers from the Company. If you do not wish to have your contact information used by Ethan Allen to promote our own or third parties' products or services, you can opt out by clicking on the “Mailing List Preferences” in the Client Services section at the bottom of any page on ethanallen.com or ethanallen.ca, or you may contact Client Services by phone: in the U.S. by calling 888-324-3571; in Canada by calling 877-386-9741. If you no longer wish to receive our digital communications, please call Customer Service at the above number (if in the U.S.), click on “Email Preferences” in the Client Services section at the bottom of any page on ethanallen.com. or click the "Unsubscribe" link at the bottom of any of our emails or SMS messages.
Employment Applicants
Our Website includes a Careers feature that allows you to submit an online job application. When you submit an online application, you will be required to provide personal information, including but not limited to your name, contact information, job interests, educational and job history, and references. This information will be used by us to assess and process your application.
You will also be asked to provide equal opportunities information. Disclosure of this information is not mandatory, and if you don’t provide it, it will not affect your application. Ethan Allen will not make the information available to any staff outside of its recruitment team, including hiring managers, in a way that can identify you. Any information you provide will be used to produce and monitor equal opportunities statistics.
The online application process is hosted and supported by a third-party service provider, CareerBuilder. The CareerBuilder Applicant Tracking System receives and stores the information you provide. CareerBuilder does not disclose the personal information it receives and maintains for us to anyone else.
If we decide to interview you, we may print your application and use it during the interview process. If you are hired, your application becomes part of your employee file. If you are not immediately hired, your printed application is kept for one year and then typically will be destroyed. We may ask you to provide additional information during the interview or hiring process. We may also use the information you provide to contact you about your application; for example, to ask you to agree to a background check or to send you an offer letter.
We do not share the information you provide in the online application with anyone outside of Ethan Allen, except as we believe is required by law, with one exception: our applicant tracking system shares Equal Opportunity Employer information with HR Works, a third-party vendor that assists with analysis for our affirmative action plans. All data shared with HR Works is stripped of personally identifiable information.
Additional Rights for California Residents
Non-Discrimination
We will not discriminate against you for exercising any rights granted to you under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”). Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not
deny you goods or services;
charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties;
provide you a different level or quality of goods or services; or
suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services, or a different level or quality of goods or services.
However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your personal information's value and contain written terms that describe the program's material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time.
Other California Privacy Rights
California's "Shine the Light" law (Civil Code Section § 1798.83) permits users of our Website that are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an email to customerservice@ethanallen.com or write us at: P.O. Box 1966, 25 Lake Avenue Extension, Danbury, CT 06811, Attn: Client Services.

Data Security
We have implemented physical, electronic, and procedural measures designed to protect the confidentiality and security of your information. Our Website’s secure server uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol to encrypt your personal information before its transmission to us.
