How this information may be used, including anyone it might be shared with
Eton may use your personal information for the processing of orders, payments, and to provide you with a personalised shopping experience.

Where there is a legal obligation to do so, we may disclose your information to any relevant regulatory body. We may also use your personal information to send you marketing updates but only ever in accordance with your preferences (as detailed in the next section). We do not sell your details to third party marketing companies. We do collate information about site traffic, sales, wish list, and other commercial information which we may pass on to third parties but this information does not include any information which can identify you personally.
Finally, we may use your personal information for our internal marketing and demographic studies, together with non-personal data to monitor customer patterns so we can consistently improve our site design to better meet our visitors' needs.
From time to time Eton may employ third party business partners to collect personal information or to undertake marketing activities on Eton's behalf. In such cases, these third parties will be subject to confidentiality agreements and instructed by Eton to comply fully with the Eton Privacy Policy.
