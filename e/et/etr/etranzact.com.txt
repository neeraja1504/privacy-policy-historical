Privacy Policy
Sites Covered by this Privacy Statement
ETRANZACT is a global organization, with legal entities, business processes, management structures, and technical systems that cross borders. This Privacy Statement applies to all ETRANZACT-owned websites and domains and the websites and domains of our wholly owned subsidiaries ("ETRANZACT website"), except that a privacy policy or statement posted on ETRANZACT websites specific to a particular ETRANZACT program or service will apply instead of this Privacy Statement.
Links to non-ETRANZACT websites
The ETRANZACT website may provide links to third-party websites for your convenience and information. If you access those links, you will leave the ETRANZACT website. ETRANZACT does not control those sites or their privacy practices, which may differ from ETRANZACT's practices. We do not endorse or make any representations about third-party websites. The personal data you choose to provide to or that is collected by these third parties is not covered by the ETRANZACT Privacy Statement. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of any company before submitting your personal information.
Collection of Personal Information
To serve you better and understand your needs and interests, ETRANZACT collects, exports, and uses personal information with adequate notice and consent, along with required filings with data protection authorities, when applicable. For example, when you order products or services, apply for instant credit, request information, subscribe to marketing or support materials, register yourself or your ETRANZACT products, enter contests or participate in surveys, or apply for a job at ETRANZACT, we will ask you to provide personal information to complete these transactions. The types of personal information you provide to us on these pages may include contact information such as your name, address, telephone number, and email address;  your card number; and other unique information such as user IDs and passwords, billing and transaction information, product and service preferences, contact preferences, educational and employment background, and job interest data.
If you choose to use a tell-a-friend program on our site, we will ask you for your friend’s e-mail address and automatically send your friend a one-time e-mail inviting your friend to visit the site. ETRANZACT uses and stores this information only for the purpose of sending this one-time e-mail and to provide tell-a-friend message blocking, where available.
In addition to the information you provide, ETRANZACT may also collect information during your visit to an ETRANZACT website through our Automatic Data Collection Tools, which include Web beacons, cookies, embedded Web links, and other commonly used information-gathering tools. These tools collect certain standard information that your browser sends to our website such as your browser type and language, access times, and the address of the website from which you arrived at an ETRANZACT website. They may also collect information about your Internet Protocol (IP) address, clickstream behavior (i.e. the pages you view, the links you click, and other actions you take in connection with ETRANZACT websites) and product information. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web, allowing Web servers to locate and identify your computer. Computers use IP addresses to communicate on the Internet, allowing users to browse and shop. ETRANZACT may also use some of these Automatic Data Collection Tools in connection with certain emails sent from ETRANZACT and therefore may collect information using these tools when you open the email or click on a link contained in the email.
How we use your Information
The information ETRANZACT collects to understand your needs and interests helps ETRANZACT deliver a consistent and personalized experience.
