With the few exceptions explained below, we do not give, rent, lend, or sell individual information to our advertisers. We do provide aggregate information to advertisers to help them reach a target audience or to the general public in order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes.
We may disclose individually identifiable information as follows:
If we have your consent to disclose such information.
To an advertiser so they may fulfill an order or service placed or signed up for by a user. Please make note that once the advertiser receives the information, it will handle the information under its own privacy policies and you are responsible for understanding and agreeing to those policies before submitting your information. If you do not want a particular advertiser to have your personal information, then you should not sign up for that advertiser’s offer.
Under nondisclosure agreements, to selected partners for the purpose of marketing only ETF Media, Inc. cobranded offerings, such as an ETF newsletter published by another company. Such partners will be able to use the personal information they receive from ETF Media, Inc. only for marketing the cobranded offerings, not for marketing anything else. If you sign up for another product from one of our partners, the information you provide to that company will be subject to that partner’s own privacy policies.
If you provide us with a street address, we may provide that information to advertisers so that they can send you mail about their own products and services
If you buy something from us, we will disclose your personal information to the extent necessary to fulfill your order and charge your credit card (if applicable). We may use a fulfillment company to fill and ship your order (excluding products you download directly from our Site) and a credit card processing company to verify your card number and process the transaction.

To make it easier for us to comply with the Federal CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, we may share our e-mail list of people who have requested not to receive promotional communications from us with the list providers (or contractors) solely so that we can avoid sending e-mails to people who have asked not to receive them (or, conversely, so that our advertisers can avoid sending e-mails to people who have requested not to hear from them). We provide these lists only to list providers or contractors that we consider to be reputable, and only under strict nondisclosure/nonuse agreements.
We may disclose personal information in some other limited circumstances, but we will describe them to you when we collect the information, such as in the rules of a contest or a new service.

We may employ contractors or other third parties to help with our operations. We may give them access to databases of user information so that they can perform their services for us, including performing system maintenance, displaying personalized content (such as portfolios), performing list analysis or management, or sending mailings for us from our advertisers. These parties are all subject to confidentiality agreements that restrict their use and disclosure of information they obtain through their relationship with ETF Media, Inc.
