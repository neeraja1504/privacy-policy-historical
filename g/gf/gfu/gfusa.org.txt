Privacy Policy | Grameen Foundation | Connecting the World's Poor to Their Potential
Grameen Foundation (“GF” or “we”) respects the right to privacy of our clients (“you”) and is committed to maintaining your confidence and trust. This Privacy Policy explains what kind of private data we collect from our clients; why we collect such information; how we share, transfer and secure private data; and your privacy rights.
What Private Data Do We Collect?
Grameen Foundation is a non-governmental organization whose charitable mission is to help the world's poorest – especially women – improve their lives and escape poverty by providing them with access to appropriate financial services, life-changing information and unique income-generating opportunities.  In order to carry out our mission and with your express consent, we collect the following data from individuals and organizations:
Personal information about clients benefiting from Grameen Foundation’s programs
Organizational data from institutions that Grameen Foundation works with
Information to track our loans and investments, such as financial reporting and annual financial statements
Information from individuals interested in entering our Bankers without Borders® database of potential volunteers
Personal data from our donors
Personal information to access certain features on our website that allow you to send and receive information to and from us and to donate to us (we collect credit card information only for the purpose of processing your donation)
Information for internal tracking of personnel and financial operations
Why Do We Collect Private Data?
We collect and otherwise use private data from our clients for specific purposes that are limited to furthering our charitable mission.  Grameen Foundation does not collect or otherwise use private data without legal authorization, contractual obligation and/or our clients’ express written consent.
The information we collect helps us to: (1) design and improve products and services that meet our clients’ needs; (2) monitor the effectiveness of our programs so that we, our investors, local governments and our other third-party partners know who we are reaching with our products and services and where we need to improve our outreach; (3) evaluate individual skill sets and match them to corresponding needs in the field; (4) track health or agricultural information of our clients so we can give them (or their health care providers) relevant and useful information; (5) monitor our investments; (6) conduct research in the aggregate in order to understand our global and regional poverty outreach; and (7) track personnel and financial operations for internal purposes.
With Whom Do We Share Private Data?
Grameen Foundation will never sell, rent or trade your email address or other private donor information collected online or offline with third parties. When required by law, we may disclose personal information to fight fraud or to protect the rights or property of Grameen Foundation, our clients, our donors or others.
Transfer of Private Data
In connection with any of the uses or sharing of private data described in this Privacy Policy, we may transfer our clients’ private data internationally, to an organization outside the country in which the information is collected.  Grameen Foundation will follow all data protection protocols required by applicable local laws.
Security
Grameen Foundation is committed to protecting your private data against unlawful destruction, accidental loss or alteration, or unauthorized disclosure or access.  First, we only collect and otherwise use private data that is relevant to, proportional to and in furtherance of the charitable purposes for which it is obtained.  Second, we do not store your personal or sensitive information any longer than is necessary to satisfy those purposes.  Third, when we store or otherwise use your personal or sensitive information, we use reasonable administrative, technical and physical safeguards that are designed to protect and secure private data adequately.  For example:
When you donate to Grameen Foundation via our website, your donation information is encrypted and transmitted by way of a secure connection  (Note: No security systems are perfect, and we cannot guarantee the security of our clients’ information)
All sensitive information is stored anonymously
We ensure that the entities with whom we share our clients’ private data have agreed to provide sufficient guarantees, in compliance with local law, to secure and protect that data
We annually audit our Privacy Policy in order to ensure internal compliance, to ensure compliance with local law, and to make any modifications to the Policy that may be necessary
Your Privacy Rights
You have a right to access and control your private data that we have collected and stored.  Accordingly, you may ask at reasonable intervals for a copy of any personal or sensitive information about you that we have collected and stored.  We will provide you with a copy with reasonable promptness and at no expense.  You may also ask that we correct, update or delete any of your private data.
Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information
We also collect non-personal information – data in a form that does not provide direct association with any specific individual. We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose. The following are some examples of non-personal information that we collect and how we may use it:
Normal Web Browsing
The information we gather during normal browsing comes from two sources: standard server logs collect information such as the IP (Internet Protocol) address, domain name, browser type, operating system; and information such as the site that referred you to us, the files you downloaded, the pages you visited, and the dates/times of those visits. We may use this information to improve our outreach and communications about our work.
Additionally, if you have come into the site from one of our newsletters or from a site that has requested a link to us, we will ask your browser to accept a cookie that carries a general marketing source code with you as you browse through the site, in order to help us match referring site to donations made. This cookie does not capture or hold any personally identifying information about you, and is deleted when you end your session by leaving our site or closing your browser.
Cookies and Other Technologies
When you visit our website, we might store some information on your computer in the form of a “cookie” (i.e. a small piece of text that stores information on your browser in your computer’s hard drive) or similar file. We use conversion tracking cookies as part of campaigns in order to analyze trends, gather broad demographic information, and monitor site traffic patterns that can help us further develop and improve the design and functionality of our site. Similarly, we also use cookies for ”retargeting” in our internet advertising campaigns so that third party vendors, including Google, can show you advertising about Grameen Foundation as you browse the internet. Retargeting is a marketing tool that identifies you as a previous visitor to the Grameen Foundation website and targets you for specific outreach messages, encouraging you to revisit our website or consider donating. The cookies will only be used to obtain non-personal information (you will be anonymous). If you prefer, you can usually set your browser to refuse cookies, or to notify you when you receive a new cookie. You can also opt out of receiving cookies on the Grameen Foundation website for Google advertising by visiting the Google advertising opt-out page (http://www.google.com/privacy/ads/#toc-edit).
