What personal data we collect and why we collect it
We are committed to protecting your privacy. The following information explains why personal data is collected.
Comments
GFMD reserves the right to feature comments on our blog and other parts of the website. When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection. An anonymised string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it, and in line with their privacy policy. After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.
Media
If you upload images to the website, you should avoid uploading images with embedded location data (EXIF GPS) included. Visitors to the website can download and extract any location data from images on the website.
Content forms and newsletter
We collect and store data that is voluntarily shared with us when a user registers to receive our news, updates, and the MediaDev Insider Newsletter via our MailChimp newsletter subscription service, which is in line with MailChimp’s privacy policy.
The only information you are required to share when subscribing to our updates is an email address. You may also include your first name, surname, and organisation based on your preferences, but this information is not required.
Note that if you sign up for our newsletter and updates, you can change your mind at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link in the footer of any email you receive from us. We will treat your information with respect.

Data sharing information: Who we share your data with
We never sell, lease, or rent your data.
We do not share your information with third-party services unless stated otherwise in this privacy policy. We reserve the right to share data with our members and partners, but only limited to first name, surname, email address, organisation, and position/title.
How long we retain your data
If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognise and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.
For users that register on our website, we also store the personal information they provide in their user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.
What rights you have over your data
If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.
Where we send your data
Visitor comments may be checked through an automated spam detection service built into our WordPress theme. We do not currently employ a separate plugin dedicated to spam detection.
Social media
The GFMD website interfaces with five social media websites: Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Medium, and YouTube. If you choose to comment, “like,” follow, tweet, or share information from the GFMD website through these services, we encourage you to review the privacy policy of the respective service you interact with. If you are a member of a social media site, the interfaces may allow the social media site to connect your site visit to your personal data.
While we encourage engagement with our social media profiles, bear in mind that that they are public fora and any information provided will be visible to the public. Therefore, please do not include personal details such as your email address, mobile number, or any other personal information that you do not want available to the general public.
While some Personally Identifying Information (PII) may become available to GFMD through your use of social media, we will not be collecting, sharing, or storing that information.
Our presence on these social media sites is not intended to endorse, recommend, or favor any third-party company or service provider. We also remind you to comply with each platform’s terms and conditions.
Security information and how we protect your data
We are committed to your security, especially due to the sensitive nature of some of our and our members’ work. This is why all GFMD content is delivered over HTTPS. We also employ other security measures including WordPress plugins such as but not limited to iThemes Security and other measures to ensure our website users are protected to the extent that GFMD and our hosting service can provide.
If a data breach occurs, we will work with our host provider, our website developer, and the relevant authorities to investigate the breach. This includes when it occurred and what data (if any) was copied or stolen. We will then reach out to our registered members and any other parties with information stored in our website database to notify them of the breach and the steps and measures we are taking to both improve our security as well as identify the party(ies) that breached us.
