**Information Sharing and Disclosure  **
We take very seriously our responsibility to maintain your privacy with respect to your information. We will therefore share that information only with the following entities, and only under these circumstances:
with entities that provide services on our behalf, including Site development, maintenance and support, email distribution, and promotions management, only to the extent that these entities need the information to perform their services or as required by law, unless any additional use or sharing of the information is separately permitted under another provision of this Privacy Policy;
within the Class Editori Group;
with identified entities whose products or services you specifically use or request to receive while you use the Site;
with other selected third parties which we believe provide products or services our clients may find interesting or appealing so that they may send you promotional materials about goods and services that they offer, but from which you have the opportunity to opt out of our sharing personally identifiable information about you as described below in “Your Privacy Rights";
when we believe that doing so is required by law, may be necessary to protect any person’s property, rights, or safety, or to investigate a potential violation of law, will help to enforce any terms of use or other legal agreement, or will help resolve disputes that arise in the ordinary course of business, or in the event of a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale;
in aggregated or other non-personally identifiable form; or
in accordance with your consent.
We are very selective when determining whether a third party organization is worthy of being entrusted with our clients’ personal information, and we hold those organizations with which we do share such information to high security and ethical standards as well as an obligation to use that personal information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.
