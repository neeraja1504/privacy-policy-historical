Cookies, Web Beacons & Other Tracking Technologies
GLOBALFOUNDRIES uses cookies to allow us to understand what areas of our Web site are of interest to you so we can better serve and provide you with tailored information from our Web site. A cookie is an element of data that a Web site can send to your browser, which may then store it on your system. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. These cookies do not track individual information, but rather record Web site traffic anonymously.
Some GLOBALFOUNDRIES Web sites may also use "Web beacon" technologies. When a visitor accesses pages on the GLOBALFOUNDRIES Web site with a Web beacon, an anonymous notice of that visit is generated which may be processed by us or by our vendors. These Web beacons work in conjunction with cookies to let us know what portions of our site are of interest to our visitors and to help us provide you with tailored information from our web site.
If you turn off cookies, Web beacon technologies will still detect anonymous visits, but the notices they generate cannot be associated with other anonymous information or personally-identifiable information and are disregarded.
