Geek 2 Geek Privacy Policy
Geek 2 Geek takes your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy.We at Geek 2 Geek ("we" or "Geek 2 Geek") have created this privacy policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to protecting your personal information and informing you about how we handle it. This privacy policy only applies to transactions and activities in which you engage, and data gathered, on the Geek 2 Geek Website and double blind email communications between Geek 2 Geek members (collectively, the "Site") but does not apply to any other Website or offline point of contact between Geek 2 Geek, or any other company, and consumers. Please review this privacy policy periodically as we may modify it from time to time. Each time you visit the Site or provide us with information, by doing so you are accepting the practices described in this privacy policy at that time.
All member portraits and profiles are screened by real people for appropriateness before being posted to the site. That includes making sure that the portrait and profile do not include any specific identifying information. In addition, all communication between members is done through Geek 2 Geek's double-blind email system, with members using an anonymous display name and not their real email address. This ensures that no personal contact information is revealed until a member is ready to do so.
