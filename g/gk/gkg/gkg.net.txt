Domain Name Registration Information and Its Use
a . Information You Are Required to Submit. As part of the registration process, you are required to provide certain information and to update promptly this information as requested by GKG, to keep it current, complete and accurate. The information you are obligated to provide in connection with the domain name you are registering is the following:
i. Your name, postal address, and physical address (or if different, that of the domain name holder);

You agree and acknowledge that when you renew your domain name registration, the type of information you are required to provide may have changed. If you do not wish to provide the new required information, your registration may not be renewed.
All other information which we may request from you at registration is voluntary. However, not providing this information may prevent you from obtaining all products and services made available to domain name registrants by us, other than registration of the domain name.
b. Additional Information Maintained About Your Registration. In addition to the information you provide, we maintain records relating to your domain name registration. These records may include:
i. The original creation date of the registration;
ii. The submission date and time of the registration application to us and by us to the proper registry;
iii. Communications (electronic or paper form) constituting registration orders, modifications, or terminations and related correspondence between you and us;
iv. Records of account for your domain name registration, including dates and amounts of all payments and refunds;
v. The IP addresses of the primary nameserver and any secondary nameservers for the domain name;
vi. The corresponding names of those nameservers;
vii. The name, postal address, physical address, e-mail address, voice telephone number, and where available, fax number of the technical contact for the domain name;

c. Obligations Relating to Provided Data. In the event that, in registering the domain name, you are providing information about a third party, you hereby represent that you have (a) provided notice to that third party of the disclosure and use of that party's information as set forth in this Agreement, and (b) that you have obtained that third party's express consent to the disclosure and use of that party's information as set forth in this Agreement.
You acknowledge that willfully providing inaccurate information or willfully failing to update information promptly will constitute a material breach of this Agreement and will be sufficient basis for cancellation of your domain name registration. You further agree that your failure to respond within fifteen (15) calendar days to inquiries by GKG concerning the accuracy of contact details associated with your registration shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement and will be sufficient basis for cancellation of your domain name registration.
d. Disclosure and Use of Registration Information. You agree and acknowledge that GKG will make available domain name registration information you provide or that we otherwise maintain to ICANN, to the registry administrator(s), and to other third parties as ICANN and applicable laws may require or permit. You further agree and acknowledge that GKG may make publicly available, or directly available to third party vendors, some, or all, of the domain name registration information you provide, for purposes of inspection (such as through our WHOIS service) or for targeted marketing and other purposes as required or permitted by ICANN and applicable laws.
Additionally, you acknowledge that ICANN may establish guidelines, limits and/or requirements that relate to the amount and type of information that GKG may or must make available to the public or to private entities, and the manner in which such information is made available.
You hereby consent to any and all such disclosures and use of, and guidelines, limits and restrictions on disclosure or use of, information provided by you in connection with the registration of a domain name (including any updates to such information), whether during or after the term of your registration of the domain name. You hereby irrevocably waive any and all claims and causes of action you may have arising from such disclosure or use of your domain name registration information by GKG.
You may access your domain name registration information in GKG's possession to review, modify or update such information, by accessing our domain manager service, or similar service, made available at our Web site (http://www.gkg.net).
We will not process data about any identified or identifiable natural person that we obtain from you in a way incompatible with the purposes and other limitations which we describe in this Agreement.
GKG will take reasonable precautions to protect the information it obtains from you from our loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration or destruction of that information.

You agree and acknowledge that GKG owns all database, compilation, collective and similar rights, title and interests worldwide in our domain name database, and all information and derivative works generated from the domain name database. You further agree and acknowledge that we own the following information for those registrations for which we are the registrar: (a) the original creation date of the registration, (b) the expiration date of the registration, (c) the name, postal address, e-mail address, voice telephone number, and where available fax number of the technical contact, administrative contact, zone contact and billing contact for the domain name registration, (d) any remarks concerning the registered domain name that appear or should appear in the WHOIS or similar database, and (e) any other information we generate or obtain in connection with the provision of domain name registration services, other than the domain name being registered, the IP addresses of the primary nameserver and any secondary nameservers for the domain name, and the corresponding names of those nameservers.
