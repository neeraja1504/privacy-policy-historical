We also use this information to help us improve our services to you, allowing us to customize your browsing and inform you of additional products and services.
Most of the information is what you provide to us directly, such as name, phone number, e-mail address, social security number and other relevant information. This information is given to us when you complete your account application, submit an e-mail or respond to a special offer or promotion. Information collected indirectly can include internet service provider, internet protocol address, and transaction history and time stamps.

This technology allows us to determine when you arrive at or leave our site, what pages you view and when you are logged in to our site. We never share this information with third-party companies or individuals; it is only readable by us and does not contain account or password information.
We employ many safeguards to protect your personal information including physical and electronic means. Only employees who have a direct need for your information will have access to it, and we recommend you do not disclose your account number and password to anyone. We use encryption technology such as VeriSign for added safety of your information, and we conduct regular audits of our system to ensure our confidentiality standards are meeting expectations.
We never disclose any private or otherwise confidential information in regards to our clients and former clients to third parties.
