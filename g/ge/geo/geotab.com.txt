Geotab Privacy Policy
Effective as of May 16, 2019 Geotab Inc., its affiliates and subsidiaries (collectively “Geotab” or “we” or “us” or “our”) have updated our Privacy Policy (“Policy”).
This Policy outlines Geotab’s commitment to protecting the privacy of individuals (“you”) who: visit our website, subscribe to the Geotab Solution or other services of ours, resell the Geotab Solution, or attend events sponsored by Geotab or its affiliates.
This Policy applies to our collection, processing and use of personal data when you use the following:
Any website that Geotab operates and which displays or links to this Policy (“website(s)”), including www.geotab.com.
MyGeotab, a web-based fleet management software platform that is available to Geotab customers after they have accepted the Geotab End User Agreement (a "Customer"). This software platform, together with a vehicle device (the “Geotab Solution”) installed in a Customer vehicle, enables Customers to manage all fleet vehicle and driver information in one place and use it to make more informed decisions regarding their fleet.
MyAdmin, the web-based reseller management software tool used to support resellers as part of the Geotab Solution. Resellers must enter into a reseller agreement with Geotab to have access to MyAdmin and resell the Geotab Solution. MyAdmin allows resellers to place orders, organize devices by Customer, administer rate plans, open and update support tickets, provide training material and resources, handle return merchandise authorizations, and provide additional support to Customers.
Geotab Marketplace, which provides access to customized applications and solutions such as in-vehicle cameras, real time temperature tracking, tire pressure monitoring and other add-ons through mobile apps, third party integrations, business services, and other products. If you acquire, subscribe to, or download an application advertised on Geotab Marketplace, please refer to the privacy policy or statement associated with that particular application.
For the purposes of this Policy, personal data means information or data relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. A person is considered identifiable if they can be identified directly, or indirectly, by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors that indicate their identity.
Our website may contain links to other websites that are operated by third parties. This Policy does not apply to those websites. We strongly suggest that you carefully review the privacy policies and statements of any third-party websites to properly understand their information practices.

To use MyGeotab, you or another representative from your organization must set up a MyGeotab account and provide us with certain information such as name, address, phone number, email address, company name, or company website.
We also collect information about an account holder’s activities on MyGeotab. MyGeotab provides Customers with the ability to obtain, among other types of data, GPS vehicle location data, engine and diagnostic data, and mapping information. GPS coordinates can be anonymously provided to a third party service provider to obtain mapping information without identifying a particular vehicle, Customer, or driver. We only process personal data about a driver operating a vehicle connected to the Geotab solution when that Customer enters the driver's personal data into the MyGeotab platform, and only in accordance with the Customer's written instructions or as required by applicable law.
MyAdmin
To use MyAdmin, a reseller’s representative must set up a MyAdmin account and provide us with certain information such as name, address, phone number, email address, company name, company website, company financial information, and payment information.

Device and Vehicle Data
The Geotab Solution is comprised of a software platform and a vehicle device (hardware) to enable Customers to collect vehicle data to manage their fleets. The vehicle device is installed into a vehicle’s on-board diagnostic port (also called the OBDII) that facilitates the extraction of data about the vehicle and its use. Any data that is temporarily stored on the device is encrypted. The vehicle data on a device is then transmitted to Geotab’s servers through secured wireless telecommunications networks and stored on encrypted cloud servers, in accordance with the applicable providers’ respective privacy, data handling and data usage policies. For more information, see the Geotab End User Agreement - Third Party Wireless Terms. To the extent such data includes personal data about you, we only use such data at the direction of the Customer who uses the MyGeotab Solution to collect personal data about you.

Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data(Applicable to EEA only)
If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), Geotab’s legal basis for collecting and processing the personal data we receive depends on the context in which it is sent to us. In our normal course of business, we will only collect and process personal data that has been sent to us by you or our Customer through: the Geotab website, the MyGeotab platform, the MyAdmin platform, or the Geotab Marketplace. We will process the personal data sent to us where you have provided your consent (as of May 25, 2018 based on Art. 6 of the GDPR) or where the processing of the information is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms (as of May 25, 2018 based on Art. 6 of the GDPR). We may also process your personal data where we have a legal obligation to collect and process personal data and are the controller in respect of such data (as of May 25, 2018 based on Art. 6 of the GDPR), or where the processing is necessary to protect your vital interests or that of another natural person (as of May 25, 2018 based on Art. 6 of the GDPR).
In circumstances where we rely on your consent to process the personal data, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. However, this may not affect the lawfulness of the processing based on the consent Geotab has received prior to the withdrawal of consent.
If you provide Geotab your personal data to comply with a legal requirement (e.g. Hours of Service) or to perform a contract (e.g. End User Agreement), we will make this clear to you at the relevant time. Geotab recommends that Customers, users, and resellers take steps to minimize the personal data they ask Geotab to process.
Service Providers
Geotab may share information, including personal data, with our third party service providers that we engage for providing hosting, for maintenance of our websites, applications, backup, storage, payment processing, analytics, and other services. We do not allow our service providers with whom we share personal data to use that information for marketing or any other purpose other than in connection with the services they provide to Geotab. See Exhibit “A” below for more information.
Complying with the Law and Law Enforcement Requests
In some circumstances, we may receive a request from public authorities to disclose personal data in response to a legally binding request to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. As applicable, we may disclose personal data to comply with subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to enforce our legal rights and defend against legal claims. In some cases, we may also share personal data if we believe that illegal or fraudulent activity is or has taken place so that we can investigate, prevent, and take appropriate action regarding such activities that may pose a potential threat to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Customer agreements, or to comply with the law. If your personal data becomes subject to a legal disclosure requirement and we are permitted to do so, we will attempt to notify you of said disclosure, if we have current contact information on file.
Success Stories
From time to time, we may post success stories on our website or in other publicly distributed material that contains personal data. In such cases, we obtain your written consent before posting your name or other personal data with the success story. If you wish to delete or remove your success story, you can contact us at legal@geotab.com.

For personal data that we process on behalf of resellers and customers users, we will retain such personal data in accordance with the terms of our agreement with them, subject to applicable laws.
