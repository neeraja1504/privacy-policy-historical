As a pharmacy, we will use and disclose your PHI as necessary to maintain your patient profile, which includes information about you, your medical condition, medications and prescription devices that you use, any allergies that you may have and other information, such as any health insurance that you may have. We will use and disclose your PHI in dispensing prescription medicines and related products and services, including counseling you and your caregivers about proper use of your medications. We will also use your patient profile to watch for medication related problems, such a drug interactions and overuse or under use of your medications that may present a risk to you.

These activities include primarily billing you directly or someone who pays for your health care, such as a family member or health insurance company, for health care products and services that we provide to you. Activities related to billing may include claims management, collections and related health care data processing. Depending on who pays for the health care products and services that we provide you, other activities may include eligibility determination; drug coverage determination; medical necessity under a health plan; appropriateness of care, or justification of charges; including prior authorization of drugs and services; prospective and retrospective drug utilization review services.
Some examples of PHI that may be used and disclosed to collect payment are:

We will use and disclose your PHI to carry out the above activities as necessary or required to obtain payment for the health care products and services that we provide to you. In relation to this, public and private health care insurance programs that may provide or pay for your health care can conduct audits, inspections and investigations of us in relation to our activities and your activities. We may be required to disclose your PHI to these programs for purposes of audits, inspections and investigations. Health care operations: HIPAA defines health care operations as those activities necessary and related to our providing of health care products and services to you. These activities include, but may not be limited to, the following:

Business associates: The health care system is very complex and as such we may not be able to provide health care products and services to you without the involvement of other businesses or persons.

In many situations it will be necessary for us to provide your PHI to these business associates so that they can carry out the activities that we need to have performed in order to provide you health care products and services. For patients that have health insurance that includes a pharmacy benefit, one of our most common business associates is a health insurance company or a pharmacy benefits company that processes claims we submit for payment for health care products and services on your behalf. We have written contracts with all of our business associates to whom we provide your PHI so that they can carry out their activities on our behalf. In an effort to provide you a level of comfort, you should know, these contracts require our business associates to give us their assurance that they, like us, will protect the privacy of your HIPAA.
Communications with you concerning your health and treatment:

We routinely monitor your prescription medications for appropriateness and take other steps to help you use your medication properly. For example, if you forget to obtain a refill of your medication, we may contact you to remind you to obtain the refill. We may also call you or send you materials regarding products and services that we believe may be of benefit to you. In the event that a pharmaceutical manufacturer or the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is to issue a medication recall, we may contact you if you are taking the medication subject to the recall.

We may disclose your PHI to federal and state government agencies for a variety of purposes, most of which are directed at monitoring health care quality and safety, government programs related to health care and our compliance with laws applicable to health care. For example, the United State Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) monitors the distribution and use of controlled substances, while the FDA monitors adverse drug events. We may disclose your PHI to such agencies where required by the agency so that the agency can carry out its required activities. Related to this, some private businesses, such as the manufacturers of medications and medical devices, are legally required to conduct post marketing surveillance in order to ensure the safety of their products.

A number of federal, state and local government agencies are charged with enforcing the health care and drug laws, and other laws in relations to the health care products and services that we may provide to you.

These agencies may engage in a number of activities designed to monitor and improve federal and state health care programs and systems, including conducting of inspections and investigations of our activities and the health care products and services that we provide to our patients. At any time we are required by federal or state laws, or by court order, subpoena of other legal mandate, to disclose your PHI we will do so as necessary.
Legal disputes: Lawsuits and other legal disputes are common today, and depending on the issues, may involve your PHI that we possess. In the event that you are involved in a lawsuit or other legal proceeding, whether as a plaintiff or a defendant, and without regard to the basis for the lawsuit, such as medical malpractice or divorce, we will disclose your PHI when required to comply with a court order, subpoena, discovery proceeding, such as a deposition, or other legal mandate served upon us. We will attempt to notify you prior to the disclosure if you are not the party to the legal dispute requesting your PHI so that you and your attorney can determine whether you want to take legal actions to prevent disclosure of your PHI.
Disclosures for the benefit of you and others:
Events can occur where we would use and disclosure your PHI for your benefit and to prevent or reduce the risk of harm to you.

The same is true if a family member, friend or caregiver contacts us in an emergency situation, or where an emergency situation is not present, but we have reason to believe you are at risk of harm or serious injury and we believe that disclosing your PHI will assist them in caring for you. We may also disclose your PHI upon your death to a funeral director, embalmer, medical examiner or coroner's office to assist them in carrying out their legal responsibilities related to your death. Finally, we may disclose your PHI where necessary to protect the health and safety of others.
