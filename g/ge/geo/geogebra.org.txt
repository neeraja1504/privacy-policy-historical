Privacy – GeoGebra
Last updated: May 12, 2018
Welcome to the website and online services (the "Website") of GeoGebra!
Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy describes the information we gather from you, how we use that information, and what we do to protect it. By using the Website (whether or not you are a registered user), you expressly consent to the information handling practices described in this policy.
Children, typically students in K-12 education, are given additional and special privacy assurances, described in the section 'Our Commitment to Children's Privacy'.
Your use of the Website and any personal information you provide on the Website are subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy and GeoGebra's Terms of Service. Any capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in the Terms of Service.
The collection, administration and use of personal details by GeoGebra complies with applicable data protection laws (General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR) by ensuring that each user is able to decide herself, which personal details shall be made accessible to other users.
Please take a moment to read everything carefully. In case of further questions please do not hesitate to contact us at office@geogebra.org.
Our Commitment to Children's Privacy
Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. If GeoGebra learns that personally identifiable information of children has been collected on the Website without parental consent, then GeoGebra will take the appropriate steps to delete this information. If you are a parent or legal guardian and discover that your child has a registered account with the Website without your consent, then you may alert GeoGebra at office@geogebra.org and request that GeoGebra delete that child's personal information from its systems.
In particular, we never share the personal information of any user with third parties.
It's important to remember that you do not need to register or sign in to the Website in order to use the GeoGebra software and access millions of GeoGebra resources.
The Information GeoGebra Collects
User-provided Information: When you register for, browse and use the Website, you may provide to GeoGebra what is generally called "personally identifiable information". Certain information has to be given by a user in order to register for a GeoGebra Account, such as:
A unique username
E-mail address
Certain information is optional after registration and can also be added or deleted later on by the user, such as:
Your full name
Whether you are a Teacher or a Student
Gender
Year of Birth
Your geographical location
URL of further/private website
A personal text about yourself
Profile picture
After Registration different types of data are collected by GeoGebra, such as:
When you follow other users on our website
When you join a group on our website
If you decide to register through or otherwise grant access to a third party social networking or integrated service that we may make available ("Integrated Service"), such as Microsoft, Facebook, or Google, GeoGebra may also collect any such "personally identifiable information" that you have provided to the Integrated Service from the account you have with the Integrated Service. You may revoke GeoGebra's access to your account on the Integrated Service at any time by updating the appropriate settings in the account preferences of the respective Integrated Service. You should check your privacy settings on each Integrated Service to understand and change the information sent to us through each Integrated Service. Please review each Integrated Service's terms of use and privacy policies carefully before using their services and connecting to our Website. From time to time, GeoGebra may also ask you optionally to provide other information. If you choose to provide such information, during registration or otherwise, you are giving GeoGebra the permission to use and store it consistent with this policy. Therefore, please understand that if you choose to register an account and sign in to the Website, you are not anonymous to us.
Information from other Users: We may make available certain features in the Website that allow other Users of the Website to provide us information that may include personally identifiable information that you provided when registering an account. For example, we may permit a Teacher to register a service for you on your behalf in which the Teacher pre-populates certain teaching/instructional features (in GeoGebra Groups for example) with information about you.
"Cookies" Information: When you visit the Website, whether or not you are a registered user, we may send one or more cookies - small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer. Cookies are used by GeoGebra to provide a more user-friendly, effective and secure service. Cookies remember information about your activities on a website. GeoGebra may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Website. Persistent cookies can be removed. Please review your web browser "Help" file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings. However, without cookies you will not have access to certain services and features on the Website.
Google Analytics: This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (“Google”). Google Analytics uses “cookies”, which are text files placed on your computer, to help the website analyze how users use the site. We process your data on the basis of our prevailing legitimate interest to cost-efficiently generate easy to use website access statistics (Article 6(1)(f) General Data Protection Regulation). The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including your IP address and the URLs of the accessed pages) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. We do not store any of your personal data collected in connection with Google Analytics. This website uses an IP anonymization feature provided by Google Analytics. Your IP address will therefore be truncated/anonymized by Google as soon as it receives it. On our behalf, Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage to us. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser. However, please note that if you do this, you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website. Furthermore you can prevent Google’s collection and use of your data by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available under https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout. Further information concerning Google’s terms of use and privacy statement can be found at https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/gb.html.

For data protection/privacy reasons the mentioned plugins are deactivated by default and must be explicitly activated by you during your use hereof. Before activating these plugins please note the following information regarding the mentioned providers:
Such plugins can recognize a user’s IP address and the page visited on our website and, possibly, store cookies, so that the services offered by GeoGebra work properly. Social media plugins and widgets are hosted either by third party providers or directly by us. Your interactions with these plugins are subject to this privacy policy or the privacy policy of any third party that offers such feature. GeoGebra is not responsible for the use of, or guidelines regarding the use of, personal data by third party providers. Users may recognize the respective plugins, e.g., by the respective logo or other respective characteristic typical for the respective social media-platform on our pages. If a user interacts with the plugins, e. g. by clicking on the Facebook "Like-Button" or entering a comment, while being logged in to such user's Social Media-account on Facebook, Google+, or Twitter, a user links the contents of the GeoGebra pages to his or her respective social media-profile. Thereby, Facebook/Google+/Twitter can associate a user's visit of the GeoGebra page or use of GeoGebra Products with such user's social media-account. GeoGebra as the provider of the GeoGebra Products does not have any knowledge of the content of the transmitted data or its usage by Facebook, Google+, or Twitter.
