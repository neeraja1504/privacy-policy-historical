Specific to the GeoScienceWorld Portal
While using the GeoScienceWorld portal website, you can opt to establish a customized account that requires the input of account information (name, email address and password) and personalization preferences (email alerts). We do not gather financial or demographic information. We maintain this information in strict privacy and do not share it with others except in the form of grouped statistics. None of the shared data is personally identifiable. You can update or delete your account and preference choices at any time. In the case of our alerting services, the e-mail addresses and names of users who elect to be alerted about content in selected publications are sent to the publishers of those publications; GeoScienceWorld-affiliated publishers may use this information for marketing purposes.

This information is used to understand how our site is being used. GeoScienceWorld does not use this information to individually identify specific users and your activity on our site.

You can decide to accept or decline this option during the registration process or at any time by selecting modify my personal information.
Use of Cookies
On occasion, we may gather information about your computer for our services and to provide statistical information regarding the use of our website to our publishing partners. Such information will not identify you personally, it is just statistical data about our visitors and their use of our site. These statistical data do not identify any personal details whatsoever.
Similarly to the above, we may gather information about your general Internet use by using a cookie file. A cookie is a small file, which asks permission to be placed on your computer's hard drive. Once you agree, the file is added and the cookie helps analyze web traffic or lets you know when you visit a particular site. Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual. The web application can tailor its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your preferences.
All computers have the ability to automatically accept or decline cookies. This can be done by activating the setting on your browser, which determines how to deal with cookies. Please note that should you choose to decline cookies, you may be unable to access particular parts of our website.

Use of Your Information
GeoScienceWorld respects your privacy. We do not sell, exchange, or release your personal information (name, email address) without your consent, regardless of its source, to any third parties. The information that we collect and store relating to you is primarily used to enable us to provide services to you.
Please be advised that we do not reveal information about identifiable individuals to GeoScienceWorld-affiliated publishers but we may, on occasion, provide them with aggregate statistical information about our visitors, compiled from registration data and log file data. In addition, if you provide your e-mail address and contact name to set up alerts on a particular publishers' site, they will be able to access that information, as outlined below.
Storing Your Personal Data
Data that is provided to us is stored on our secure servers. Details relating to any transactions entered into on our site will be encrypted to enhance its safety. The transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure and therefore we cannot guarantee the security of data sent to us electronically and transmission of such data is therefore entirely at your own risk. Further, we cannot guarantee that information stored on our system or otherwise in our care will be immune from unintended release or unauthorized intrusion. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password so that you can access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential.
Access to Personal Data
An individual who wishes to access, correct, or delete their personal data should direct their inquiry to GeoScienceWorld as provided under “Contact Us,” below.
Retention of Personal Data
We will retain personal data that we process for as long as needed to provide our services and otherwise serve the legitimate interests of GeoScienceWorld.
Site of Processing of Personal Data Personal data of individuals collected by GeoScienceWorld may be stored and processed in the United States, Europe, or any other country in which GeoScienceWorld, its vendors, or partners maintain facilities. GeoScienceWorld may transfer personal data for processing across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world.
Ecommerce Transactions
Ecommerce transactions on our sites are managed by 3rd party transaction providers, such as PayPal and its affiliates. Credit card or account numbers are not visible to GeoScienceWorld employees.
Disclosing Your Information
Where applicable, we may disclose your login information to members of our staff. We may also disclose the personal information you voluntarily provide if/when legally required and/or to assist fraud protection and minimize credit risk

Exceptions for Library Administration, Pricing Quotes, Troubleshooting, and Piracy Protection
As a nonprofit collaborative organization, we share some customer data with our participating publishers and governing bodies. Typically, customer-level information may be shared in order to: a) generate price quotes; b) report business results; c) calculate content royalties; c) troubleshoot technical issues; or d) investigate issues having to do with usage or suspected piracy or misuse of content. Because we employ third-party technology partners, we may also share information with technology vendors in order to support technology services, resolve technical issues, or investigate issues relating to data reporting or suspected misuse of content. If misuse of content occurs from a specific library access point, we will share data with the library staff at that location.
