Privacy and Credit Reporting Policy
September 2017
The Latitude Companies1 ( "we"/"us"/"our" ) take our obligations to protect personal information seriously. We are bound by the Privacy Act 1988(Cth) and the Australian Privacy Principles ( "APPs" ) (together, the "Privacy Act". For Latitude Companies who are credit providers2, or who receive credit eligibility information, they are bound by PartIIIA of the Privacy Act and the 'Credit Reporting Privacy Code', which governs credit reporting in Australia.)
2. Collection of Personal Information
2.1. Kinds of Personal Information we Collect
As a group of companies offering a wide range of products and services, we collect and hold personal information about you. We collect information from our customers, prospective customers, prospective employees, contractors, suppliers, brokers, introducers, merchants, agents, service providers and the people who represent the businesses we deal with.
The type of personal information we collect and hold may vary depending on the nature of our interactions with you.
For example, our companies which provide credit would collect and hold financial information, credit-related information (see section 4), identification information, transaction / repayment history information, banking details and employment information about you. Our insurance companies3 would collect and hold similar information including sensitive information such as health information.
In order to satisfy our legal obligations, we may need to retain your information after a transaction or a relationship has ended. However, we will not retain your identifiable personal information longer than is reasonably necessary and permitted under Australian law.
We will only collect sensitive information (e.g. information about your ethnicity, health or biometric information) with your consent or when permissible under Australian law.
2.2. How we Collect your Personal Information
Wherever it is possible and practical to do so, we will collect personal information directly from you, this may be in person, over the telephone, by email, over the internet, by e-mail or fax, or by completion of a form (such as an application form).
We may also collect your personal information from a third party including a merchant or a third party with whom we have an arrangement, partnership or joint venture with. This will be limited to circumstances where it is impracticable or unreasonable for us to collect it directly from you. The type of third party who might provide information to us will vary depending on the nature of the business and interaction with you. For example, we may collect credit information and credit eligibility information from a credit reporting body or personal information from your employer to verify information in your application, hardship application or insurance claim.
When we provide credit, third parties could include:
a credit reporting body;
collection agents;
an employer; or
another financial institution.
When we provide insurance, third parties could include:
medical practitioners;
your employers; or
other experts assisting with a claim.
While this is not an exhaustive list, we may obtain your personal information from other third parties which could include:
an introducer such as a broker, agent, dealer and retail partner;
someone authorised to act on your behalf (e.g. financial advisor, executor, administrator, trustee, guardian, attorney, accountant or consumer advocate);
research agencies;
a referee;
recruitment consultant (e.g. for job applicants);
a government body;
third party service providers and / or suppliers; or
one or more of our related companies, in Australia or overseas.
3. Dealing with Personal Information
3.1. How we Hold your Personal Information
We understand the importance of protecting the personal information we hold about you. We take steps to ensure your personal information is free from misuse, interference, loss, unauthorised access or modification by:
securing personal information both in physical and electronic form;
staff education around the importance of Privacy and Data Security;
limiting access to personal information only to those that need access; and
protecting our systems with appropriate technology solutions.
3.2. The Purpose of Collecting, Holding, Using and Disclosing your Personal Information
We collect, hold, use and disclose your personal information in order to manage and administer the products and / or services we provide to our customers, whether they are individuals or businesses. You may be a customer, contractor, job applicant, supplier, partner or party with whom we do or have done business, or may do business with in the future.
As a financial services provider, a major purpose for which we hold, use or disclose personal information is to assess credit applications (including assessing any proposed guarantors), manage credit (servicing and collections activity), hardship applications, insurance agreements and claims, for planning, product and service development, research purposes and to analyse the risk profiles of our customers or potential customers.
3.3. Online Servicing or Access
When you register to access products or services online, the information collected is compared with the details we may already have stored, this might include your name and date of birth. This allows us to verify who is seeking access. If this information is not provided you will not be able to access your personal information online.
3.4. Direct Marketing
Personal Information may also be used or disclosed to advise you of products and services that may be of interest to you by means of direct marketing.
If you do not want your personal information to be used for direct marketing purposes, please contact us so that we can action this request. This is referred to as "opting out" of direct marketing. You can "opt-out" of direct marketing from each Latitude Company using the details in the 'Contact Us' table at the end of the policy.

In order to provide our products and services to our customers, from time to time, we share personal information with our related bodies corporate both in Australia and overseas, as defined in the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).

We utilise overseas service providers for some of our activities and to do so may need to disclose personal information to those service providers. We may also disclose such information to other overseas recipients for the purposes listed above when permitted to do so by the Privacy Act.
While we try to store your Personal Information locally, there may be times where our service providers are located outside of Australia. Where this happens, we always take proper steps to secure and protect your personal information, wherever its being stored.
Further, we may share your personal information with overseas recipients in accordance with this Policy, in particular, section 3.5 above.

This information will typically have been provided by other credit providers or other third parties; and
credit eligibility information (see credit eligibility information in section 9 below) about you that credit reporting bodies derive from the information above, such as credit scores, risk ratings and other evaluations about you;
