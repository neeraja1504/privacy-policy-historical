Last updated April 2, 2015.
GeekWire, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“ GeekWire ”, “ we ” “ us ” or “ our ”) recognizes that privacy is important. This Privacy Policy (this “ Policy ”) ** ** sets forth the information collection and security procedures applicable to GeekWire.com and GeekWork.com (collectively, the “ Website ”), as well as all related applications, widgets, software, tools, and other services provided by us and on which a link to this Policy is displayed (collectively, together with the Website, our “ Services ”), and describes GeekWire’s collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information (defined below) in connection with providing the Services. This Policy is incorporated by reference into the GeekWire.com and GeekWork.com Terms of Use, (hereafter referred to as the “ Terms of Use ”) and is subject to the provisions of the Terms of Use.
Please review this document to understand:
What GeekWire considers Personal Information.
What Personal Information we collect.
How we use and disclose your Personal Information.
How you can access and change your account information.
What security procedures are in place to protect the information.
How to contact us if there are any problems or concerns.
How we can update this Policy.
Upon registering for or using the Services, you explicitly acknowledge and assent to the terms of this Policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this Policy, do not use the Services. It is GeekWire’s policy to comply with data protection legislation, which grants you certain rights related to your Personal Information.
The Services may contain links to other web sites, products, or services that we do not own or operate (collectively, “ Third Party Sites ”). The Services also may contain links to Third Party Sites such as social networking services.  This Policy applies to information collected on or through the Services and not Third Party Sites referenced from our Services. We cannot control and are not responsible for the information use practices of Third Party Sites or others who may access your information on or through the Services. When you click on links to Third Party Sites, we encourage you to read their privacy policies. Their standards may differ from ours. Additionally, please be aware that the Services may contain links to web sites and services that we operate but that are governed by different privacy policies. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies applicable to any web site or service you visit other than the Services.
What is Personal Information?
“ Personal Information ” as used in this Policy, is information that specifically identifies an individual, such as an individual’s name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, resume or credit card information.  Personal Information also includes information about an individual’s activities, such as information about his or her activity on our Services, and demographic information, such as date of birth, gender, geographic area, and preferences, when any of this information is linked to Personal Information that identifies that individual.
Personal Information does not include “aggregate” or other non-personally identifiable information.  Aggregate information is information that we collect about a group or category of products, services, or users that is not personally identifiable or from which individual identities are removed.  We may use and disclose aggregate information, and other non-personally identifiable information, for various purposes.
What information do we collect?
We try to collect only what we believe is reasonably necessary to help you get the most out of the Services and to connect with the community. We collect Personal Information that our users provide to us in a variety of ways on our Services. These include the following:
Registered Users, Accounts and Profiles:  If you create an account to take advantage of all that the Services have to offer, we record Personal Information that you include in your user profile or account settings page. This includes, but is not limited to, your username, password, first and last name, email, street address, phone number, resume information, work opportunities, and related demographic information about you. Profiles may include user-submitted information such as resume data, self-assessed skills ratings, contact information, and portfolio submissions. We may indicate that some Personal Information is required for you to register for the account or to create the profile, while some is optional. If you complete a financial transaction on or through the Services, your payment information will be recorded securely by one or more of our third party e-commerce vendors, such as EventBrite or Shopify.
E – mail Newsletters:  We offer e-mail newsletters on our Services. If you sign up to receive a newsletter from us, we collect your e-mail address.
_Listings:  _We may offer you the opportunity to join various promotional lists or publications including, for instance, our “Geek of the Week” series or our database of start-ups (collectively, the “ Listings ”). We collect any Personal Information you supply when you apply to join these listings.
Integrated Services. You may be given the option to access or register for the Services through the use of your user name and passwords for certain services provided by third parties (each an “ Integrated Service ”), such as through the use of your Facebook credentials through Facebook Connect.  By doing this, you authorize us to access and store the Integrated Services credentials you provide, your name, email address(es), date of birth, gender, current city, profile picture URL, and other information that the Integrated Service makes available to us, and to use and disclose it in accordance with this Policy.  You should check your Facebook or other Integrated Service privacy settings to understand and change the information sent to us through Facebook Connect or other Integrated Services.  Please review each Integrated Service’s terms of use and privacy policies carefully before using their services and connecting to our Services.
Interactive Features:  Our Services may contain interactive functionality that allows you to engage with other users on the Services, post comments to forums, upload photographs, profiles, work opportunities and other content (the “ User Materials ”), participate in surveys, and otherwise interact with the Services and with other users.  If you use any interactive functionality on our Services that request or permit you to provide us with Personal Information (including, for example, any services that allow you to post User Materials on any of our Services), we collect the Personal Information that you provide to us in the course of using these interactive features. Some interactive functionality on the Services is provided by third parties, which may also collect, use or disclose your Personal Information. Our Services may allow you to post comments and other User Materials to designated (for example, by the word “comments,” a blank text box, or other indicia) areas on the Services operated by Disqus, a third party service. Disqus’s collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Information is subject to the Disqus privacy policy. If you do not agree to the Disqus policy, do not post comments or other User Materials to or otherwise interact with these designated areas or any associated functionality.
_Job Applications:  _If you upload a resume or apply for a specific position on or through the Services, you may be asked to provide information on your gender, race, or another personal characteristic that is a protected status under United States or other applicable law. Some employers are required by law to request this information from job applicants for meeting reporting and record-keeping obligations, but you are not required to provide this information to use the Services.  Your provision of this information is strictly voluntary. GeekWire may disclose this information as further described in this Policy.
Questions and Feedback:  If you contact us with feedback, questions, or other correspondence, we will record any Personal Information contained within or associated with your correspondence.
Contests and Sweepstakes. We or our advertisers and other business partners may conduct or sponsor special contests, sweepstakes, and other promotions that users may enter or otherwise participate in on our Services.  Certain of these promotions may be co-branded with one of our advertisers or other business partners.  In these instances, the collection of your Personal Information may occur directly by the third party partner on its website or other online service and may be shared with us.  The promotion will state the privacy policy or policies governing the collection of such personal information.
Activity on the Services:  We record information from your use of the Services, such as pages viewed, type of browser, IP address, the nature of the device from which you are visiting the Services (e.g., a personal computer or mobile device), the identifier for any handheld or mobile device that you may be using, the web site that you visited immediately prior to accessing the Services, the actions you take using the Services, the content, features and activities that you access and participate in on our Services, and timestamps for such activities. We may also collect information regarding your interaction with e-mail messages, such as whether you opened, clicked on, or forwarded a message.
Web Beacons:  Like many websites and services, we use passive technologies such as standard server logs, cookies, clear GIFs and session variables (also known as “ Web Beacons ”). A cookie, for instance, is a small text file that our Service places on a user’s computer hard drive. Web Beacons enable GeekWire to deliver customized content to users, improve the effectiveness of advertising on the Services, and administer, operate and improve the Services. If we link or associate any information gathered through passive means with Personal Information, or if applicable laws require us to treat any information gathered through passive means as Personal Information, we treat the combined information as Personal Information under this Policy. We may use persistent cookies which may not have an expiration date but can be easily removed by following the instructions in your browser documentation. However, please be aware that you may not be able to access the Services or certain portions of the Services unless cookies are enabled. Also, please be aware that Third Party Sites linked to from the Services may set cookies on your hard drive or use other Web Beacons to passively collect information about your use of their services, Third Party Sites or content.  We do not have access to, or control over, these third party means of passive data collection.
_Other Sources:  _We may receive information about you, including Personal Information, from third parties, and may combine this information with other Personal Information we maintain about you. If we do so, this Policy governs any combined information that we maintain in personally identifiable format.
Children’s Privacy:  GeekWire.com and Geekwork.com are general audience sites. Children’s safety is important to us, and we encourage parents and guardians to take an active interest in the online activities of their children. Our Services are not directed toward children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect Personal Information from users under 13 years of age without obtaining parental consent. If we learn that we have collected Personal Information from a child under the age of 13 on our services, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we may have collected any Personal Information from a child under the age of 13 on our Services, please notify us at support@geekwire.com.
