Cookies and other browser information
Gentoo's online services automatically capture IP addresses. We use IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our servers, to administer our website, and to help ensure the security of your interaction with our services. Your IP address is used to help identify you and your location.
As part of offering and providing customizable and personalized services, Gentoo uses cookies to store and sometimes track information about you. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. All sections of gentoo.org where you are prompted to log in or that are customizable require your browser to accept cookies.
Generally, we use cookies to:
Remind us of who you are and to access your account information (stored on our computers) in order to provide a better and more personalized service. This cookie is set when you register or "sign in" and is modified when you "sign out" of our services.
Estimate audience size. Each browser accessing a Gentoo site may be given a unique cookie that is used to determine the extent of repeat usage and usage by a registered user versus by an unregistered user.
Measure certain traffic patterns, which areas of Gentoo's network of websites you have visited, and your visiting patterns in the aggregate. We use this research to understand how our user's habits are similar or different from one another so that we can make each new experience on gentoo.org a better one. We may use this information to better personalize the content, banners, and promotions you and other users will see on our sites.
If you do not want your personal information to be stored by cookies, you can configure your browser so that it always rejects these cookies or asks you each time if you accept them or not. However, you must understand that the use of cookies may be necessary to provide certain services, and choosing to reject cookies will reduce the performance and functionality of the site. Your browser documentation includes precise instructions explaining how to define the acceptance of cookies.
Our commitment to data security
Gentoo trains its administrators on our privacy policy guidelines. Our services uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology where applicable, which encrypts your personal information when you send your personal information on our website. Additionally, we store your credentials as safely as possible, i.e. hashed using up-to-date algorithms, to avoid them being exposed in case of a database leak.
Public forums reminder
Gentoo makes chat rooms, forums, mailing lists, message boards, bug trackers, and/or news groups available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information. Exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. Although we value individual ideas and encourage free expression, Gentoo reserves the right to take necessary action to preserve the integrity of these areas, such as removing any posting that is vulgar or inappropriate.
Our commitment to children's online privacy
Out of special concern for children's privacy, Gentoo does not knowingly accept online personal information from children under the age of 13. Gentoo does not knowingly allow children under the age of 13 to become registered members of our sites. Gentoo does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information about children under 13.
In the event that Gentoo ever decides to expand its intended site audience to include children under the age of 13, those specific web pages will, in accordance with the requirements of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), be clearly identified and provide an explicit privacy notice addressed to children under 13. In addition, Gentoo will provide an appropriate mechanism to obtain parental approval, allow parents to subsequently make changes to or request removal of their children's personal information, and provide access to any other information as required by law.
