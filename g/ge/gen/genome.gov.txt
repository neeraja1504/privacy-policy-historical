Overview
Thank you for visiting the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) website, Genome.gov. Protecting your privacy is very important to us. We do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) about you during your visit unless you choose to provide it to us.  However, our website links to other NIH sites, federal agency sites, university/research institution sites and occasionally to private organizations, and once you leave Genome.gov, you are subject to the privacy policy for the site(s) you are visiting.
We do collect some data about your visit to our website to help us better understand how the public uses the site and how to make it more helpful. We collect information from visitors who read, browse and/or download information from our website. NHGRI never collects information for commercial marketing or any purpose unrelated to the NHGRI mission and goals.

Methods of Collecting Information
Genome.gov uses Google Analytics and other off-the-shelf analytics measurement software to collect information from the above list automatically and continuously. We use this information to measure the number of visitors to our site and its various sections and to distinguish between new and returning visitors to help make our site more useful to visitors. However, no personally identifiable information (PII) is collected.
From time to time, NHGRI staff conducts analyses and reports on the aggregated data from these systems. The reports are only available to NHGRI website managers, members of their Communications and Web Teams, and other designated staff who require this information to perform their duties.
NHGRI retains this data only as long as required by law or needed to support the mission of the NHGRI website.

Use of Cookies
The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Memo M-10-22, Guidance for Online Use of Web Measurement and Customization Technologies [whitehouse.gov] allows Federal agencies to use session and persistent cookies.
When you visit any website, its server may generate a piece of text known as a "cookie" to place on your computer. The cookie allows the server to "remember" specific information about your visit while you are connected.
The cookie makes it easier for you to use the dynamic features of Web pages. Cookies from NHGRI Web pages only collect information about your browser's visit to the site. They do not collect personal information about you.
There are two types of cookies: single session (temporary) and multi-session (persistent). Session cookies last only as long as your Web browser is open. Once you close your browser, the cookie disappears. Persistent cookies are stored on your computer for longer periods.
Temporary (Session) Cookies: We use session cookies for technical purposes such as improving navigation through our site. These cookies let our server know that you are continuing a visit to our site. The "session" cookie is not permanently stored on your computer. The cookie and the information about your visit are automatically destroyed shortly after you close your browser to end the session. The OMB Memo 10-22 Guidance defines our use of session cookies as "Usage Tier 1-Single Session." The policy says, "This tier encompasses any use of single session Web measurement and customization technologies."
Persistent Cookies: We use persistent cookies to enable Google Analytics to differentiate between new and returning NHGRI visitors. The OMB Memo M-10-22 Guidance allows Federal agencies to use persistent cookies, which remain on your computer between visits to a website until they expire. The Guidance defines our use of persistent cookies as "Usage Tier 2 - Multi-session without Personally Identifiable Information (PII)." The policy says, "This tier encompasses any use of multi-session Web measurement and customization technologies when no PII is collected."

Data Safeguarding and Privacy
All uses of Web measurement and customization technologies will comply with existing policies with respect to privacy and data safeguarding standards. Information Systems (IT) systems owned and operated by NIH are assessed using Privacy Impact Assessments posted for public view on the Department of Health and Human Services website. Groups of records that contain information about an individual and are designed to be retrieved by the name or other personal identifier linked to the individual are covered by the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (5 U.S.C. Section 552a). For these records, NIH Systems of Record Notices are published in the Federal Register and posted on the NIH Senior Official for Privacy website.

Reddit
NHGRI participates in the Ask Me Anything (AMA) series - a unique format that allows scientists to speak about their work in a manner that is not possible within the confines of traditional communication practices. In this format, questions can be explained individually and follow-up questions or comments may be fielded so that the community has a clearer understanding of the research being discussed. NHGRI uses this platform as a way to discuss our intramural research, Extramural Research Programs, new initiatives in funding, or general issues related to genomics research and genomic medicine. In effort to bring science education to the public, Reddit Science has created an independent, science-focused AMA Series. The goal is to encourage discussion and facilitate outreach while helping to bridge the gap between scientists and the general public. You do not need to register with Reddit to view the discussions because questions and answers are visible in the public domain.
If you choose to register with Reddit, you will be asked to provide a username, a password and an email address. If you log on to the Reddit site before participating in any discussions videos, Reddit may associate information about your site use with your Reddit account. Any personal information you included when registering for your account might be visible to to other users. If you do not log in before participating in discussions, your site use will not be associated with you or a Reddit account. Review the Reddit.com Privacy Policy.
