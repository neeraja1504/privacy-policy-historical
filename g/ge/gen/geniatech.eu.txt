As well as using our website for information only, and the newsletter and forms options, we offer various services which you can use if you are interested. To do this, you generally need to enter further personal data which we require and use to provide the relevant service.
Sometimes, we use external service providers to process your data. They have been carefully selected and commissioned by us, are bound by our instructions and are regularly checked.

If our processing of your personal data for the use of further functions and offers on our website relies on weighing up interests, you can submit an objection to this processing. This applies especially if the processing is not required for the fulfilment of the contract with you, which we will always highlight in the following description of the functions. If you do revoke your consent in this way, we ask you to set out your reasons why we may not process your personal data in the ways we have described. If your objection is justified, we will check the situation and either discontinue or modify data processing or set out to you the binding proprietary reasons for which we are continuing with the processing.
