GeneCopoeia Privacy Practices
Personal information
At Genecopoeia,  we intend to give   you as much control  as possible  over your
personal  information.   In  general,  you can  visit   Genecopoeia  on  the Web
without telling us  who you  are  or revealing any  information  about yourself.
There are times, however, when we  may need information from you,  such  as your
name   and address.  It  is  our intent   to let  you  know  before we  collect
personal information from you on the Internet. We do keep track of  the  domains
from   which   people  visit   us.  We   analyze  this   data   for  trends  and
statistics, and then we discard it. We have implemented these practices for  the
Genecopoeia  Web  site.
Information security and quality
We intend to protect the quality and  integrity of your  personally identifiable
information.  We   have   implemented   appropriate  technical   and  managerial
procedures to maintain  information that is  accurate, current, and complete. We
will make  a sincere  effort to  respond to  your requests  to correct  personal
information inaccuracies in a timely manner.
