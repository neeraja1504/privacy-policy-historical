Privacy – GIS | HireRight
Protecting privacy has always been a top priority at GIS. We believe that a strong privacy policy is good business. To underscore our commitment to privacy, we have amended our online privacy policy on our websites.
The policy includes our corporate privacy principles and Fair Information Practice Principles of notice, choice, access, security, and accountability.
This online privacy policy applies to all sites listed above. They are owned and operated by General Information Services (GIS), 917 Chapin Dr., Chapin, SC 29036, (888) 333-5696.
INFORMATION COLLECTION
I. Personally-identifiable information
These sites only collect personally-identifiable information from you if you choose to provide this information and to process a transaction that you requested. Personally-identifiable information collected with your consent may include, for example, name, e-mail address, resume information, or any inquires you may make through our websites. GIS only provides personally-identifiable information to third-parties in its normal course of business for two reasons: (1) in order to complete a transaction you requested, such as running a credit report through TransUnion, and (2) as required by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary in order to comply with the law or legal process.
II. Cookies
“Cookies” are messages that web servers (computers that deliver web pages) exchange with web browsers (programs that support website interaction, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer). GIS uses these messages in our customer web applications to simplify and enhance the user experience. GIS does not store any personally-identifiable information in cookies. Cookies do not act maliciously on computer systems, nor can they be used to spread viruses or access your computer’s hard drive.
III. Non-personally-identifiable information
This site also collects non-personally-identifiable information. For example, as you browse our websites, we may collect information about your visit, but not about you personally. Via web server logs, for example, we may monitor statistics such as: the number of people that visit our site, which page(s) are visited on our site, from which domain our visitors come (e.g., aol.com, hotmail.com, etc.), and which browsers people use to visit our sites (e.g., Netscape Navigator, Microsoft Internet Explorer, etc.).

PERSONAL INFORMATION DISCLOSURE: UNITED STATES OR OVERSEAS
In preparing a consumer report or investigative consumer report, we only send information about the subject of the report outside the United States if our client asks for information from a jurisdiction outside the United States. For example, if a prospective employee worked outside of the United States, our client might ask for a criminal history report for the country in which the prospective employee worked. When we do this kind of report, we send enough information to identify the subject of the report.
