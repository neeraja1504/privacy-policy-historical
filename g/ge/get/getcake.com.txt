We are concerned about the safety of children. Our website is not intended for children. We do not knowingly allow anyone under the age of 13 to provide us with personal data, and we do not knowingly collect or maintain such personal data. If you are under the age of 13, please do not access our website at any time or in any manner. We will take appropriate steps to delete the personal data of persons under the age of 13.
Hyperlinks
We may link to other websites with information gathering practices that differ from our own. Visitors should carefully review privacy policies for all websites they visit as we have no control over information submitted or collected by third parties.
We may also offer contests, sweepstakes, or other promotions from time to time that are sponsored or co-sponsored by third parties. These third parties may obtain personal data that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the contest, sweepstake or promotion. We have no control over how these third parties use this data; however, we will notify you whenever you fill out a form that will provide them access to such data.
How Is Data Secured?
We use industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring and receiving personal data. We also have appropriate security measures to protect against loss, misuse or alteration of information that we collect from you.
We operate a policy of “privacy by design” by looking for opportunities to minimize the amount of personal information we hold about you. We use appropriate technological and operational security measures to protect your information against any unauthorized access or unlawful use, such as:
ensuring the physical security of our offices, or other sites;
ensuring the physical and digital security of our equipment and devices by using appropriate password protection and encryption;
maintaining an internal data protection policy for, and delivering data protection training to, our employees; and
limiting access to your personal information to those in our company who need to use it in the course of their work.
How Long Is Data Kept For?
We will retain your information for as long as is necessary to provide you with the services that you have requested from us or for as long as we reasonably require to retain the information for our lawful business purposes (such as for the purposes of exercising our legal rights), or for as long as the law otherwise permits.
We operate a data retention policy and look to find ways to reduce the amount of information we hold about you and the length of time that we need to keep it.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
Please contact us using the information provided in the ‘About us’ section above if you would like to obtain details of our retention periods for different aspects of your personal data.
What Rights Do I Have?
Your rights
You have certain rights in respect of the information that we hold about you, including:
the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes;
the right to request access to the information that we hold about you;
in certain circumstances, the right to object to processing, i.e. to ask us to stop processing information about you; and
the right to lodge a complaint about us to the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (https://ico.org.uk/).
From 25 May 2018, you will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances. We will try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
Please note that we may need to retain certain information for our own record-keeping and research purposes. We may also need to send you service-related communications relating to your website user account even when you have requested not to receive marketing communications.
Your future rights
From 25 May 2018, in accordance with new data protection laws which will be in force from that date, you will have certain additional rights in respect of the information that we hold about you, including:
the right to lodge a complaint about us to the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (https://ico.org.uk/) or the relevant authority in your country of work or residence;
the right to withdraw your consent for our use of your information in reliance of your consent (refer to section titled “Why Do You Collect Information?” above to see when we are relying on your consent), which you can do by contacting us using the details set out at the top of this Privacy Policy;
the right to object to our using your information on the basis of our legitimate interests (refer to the section titled “Why Do You Collect Information?” above to see when we are relying on our legitimate interests); and
the right to receive a copy of any information we hold about you in connection with the performance of our contract with you or on the basis of your consent (or request that we transfer this to another service provider) in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format; and
the right to ask us to limit or cease processing or erase information we hold about you in certain circumstances.
How can I exercise my rights?
You may exercise your rights above by contacting us using the details set out at the top of this Privacy Policy in the ‘About us’ section, or in the case of preventing processing for marketing activities also by checking certain boxes on forms that we use to collect your data to tell us that you don’t want to be involved in marketing, by using the unsubscribe option available on email communication you receive from us, or by updating your marketing preferences via your account with us.
We will comply with your requests unless we have a lawful reason not to do so.
Changes and Updates
We may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time in order to address new issues, new technologies, changes in our website or business practices. We will always post these changes so you will know what information we gather and how we may use that information. We will post any changes on our site, or notify you of any material changes. Please also consult this policy regularly for such updates. Any changes will come into effect the next time you engage with us after the changes have been notified.
It is important that the personal data we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your personal data changes during your relationship with us by updating your profile account information or contacting us via the contact details at the top of this Privacy Policy.
Mediation
If you are a resident of a country outside of the European Union other than Switzerland, you also agree that, in the event any dispute or claim arises out of or relating to this Privacy Policy, excepting those concerning Privacy Shield, that you and CAKE will attempt in good faith to negotiate a written resolution of the matter directly between the parties. You agree that if the matter remains unresolved for forty-five (45) days after notification (via certified mail or personal delivery) that a dispute exists, all parties shall join in mediation services in Orange County, California with a mutually agreed mediator in an attempt to resolve the dispute. Should you file any arbitration claims, or any administrative or legal actions without first having attempted to resolve the matter by mediation, then you agree that you will not be entitled to recover attorneys’ fees, even if you would otherwise be entitled to them.
Dispute Resolution for Residents of the European Union and Switzerland
If you are a resident of the European Union, in the event that you have any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Privacy Policy, you may lodge a complaint about us to the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (https://ico.org.uk/) or the relevant authority in your country of work or residence.
Resolution of Privacy Shield Complaints
We will investigate and attempt to resolve any complaints or disputes regarding the use or disclosure of your personal information pursuant to the Privacy Shield (a “Privacy Shield Complaint”) within forty-five (45) days of receiving your complaint. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Privacy Policy, we have agreed to cooperate with JAMS with respect to any unresolved Privacy Shield Complaints. If you are unsatisfied with the resolution of your complaint, you may contact JAMS at www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield for further information and assistance. You may have the option to select binding arbitration for the resolution of your Privacy Shield Complaint under certain circumstances, provided you have taken the following steps: (a) raised your Privacy Shield Complaint directly with us and provided us the opportunity to resolve the issue; (b) made use of the independent dispute resolution mechanism provided through JAMS as identified above; and (c) raised your Privacy Shield Complaint through the relevant data protection authority and allowed the US Department of Commerce an opportunity to resolve the complaint at no cost to you. For more information on binding arbitration, see US Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield Framework: Annex I (Binding Arbitration).
Special Note to Users Outside of the United States
Our site is hosted in the United States. If you are a user accessing our site from the European Union or any other region with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure, that differ from United States laws, please be advised that your personal data will be processed outside of the European Economic Area (the “EEA”). We will take all steps necessary to ensure that your information is adequately protected and processed in accordance with this Privacy Policy, including but not limited to:
only transferring your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission;
where we use certain service providers, by using specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe (the so-called European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses); or
where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them under the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework or the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework, in each case as administered by the US Department of Commerce (the “Privacy Shield”), which requires such recipients to provide similar protection to personal data shared between Europe and the US. For more information on the Privacy Shield and our obligations thereunder, please refer to the section titled “Privacy Shield” below.
You consent to such cross-border transfers of your information. Please contact us using the contact details set out in the ‘About us’ section if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.
Privacy Shield
We recognize that the EEA and Switzerland (collectively, the “Privacy Shield Jurisdictions”) have established strict protections regarding the handling of certain personal information that we receive in the US from the Privacy Shield Jurisdictions (“Privacy Shield Data”), including requirements to provide adequate protection for Privacy Shield Data transferred outside of the Privacy Shield Jurisdictions. To provide adequate protection for certain Privacy Shield Data about consumers and suppliers received in the US, we have elected to self-certify to the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework. We adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement, and Liability.
For purposes of enforcing compliance with the Privacy Shield, we are subject to the investigatory and enforcement authority of the US Federal Trade Commission. For more information about the Privacy Shield, see the US Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield website located at www.privacyshield.gov. To review our representation on the Privacy Shield list, see the US Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield self-certification list located at www.privacyshield.gov/list.
