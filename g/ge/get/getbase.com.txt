Privacy Notice | Sell
We're committed to the confidentiality and security of your personal information.
We’re committed to the confidentiality and security of your personal information. If you are the customer of one of our clients, you may not have heard of us. Still, there is nothing more important to us than our relationship with you. You may not know why we would have data about you in our system. We process data on behalf of companies with whom you have a relationship, with whom you have shared your data. In simple terms, you are a data subject, your service provider is a data controller (who determines how your data can be processed) and we act as a data processor. We’re committed to the confidentiality and security of any personal information that has been provided to us about you. This Privacy Notice explains how we protect your rights and care for your information. It also describes:

Who to contact with any requests, concerns, or complaints
Who we are
Zendesk Sell (“The Service”) online services and the web site https://getbase.com are provided by FutureSimple Inc. (“The Company”). We are based in San Francisco, CA, US.
What we do as a company
We are a provider of sales tools, customer relationship tools, and analytics that empower our clients to better serve their customers.
Who are our clients
We are a processor. Our tools and services are used by the companies that serve you. We work with companies of all sizes, in all industries around the world.
Why you may not have heard about us
Individuals do not use our services directly. Whether an employer, or a business working with other businesses as their customers, or a business working with consumers directly, companies need and gather information to better serve their clients. These companies use our platform to hold, analyze and get the most from the information they collect.
The type of data we process
Each client uses data differently. What is common to most is that they compile data that helps them better relate to you and provide services. Such information may include:
contact information and preferences
specific requirements you may have or interests you have expressed
preference as to how your service provided may contact you and how frequently
information you may have shared in conversations, emails, meetings
information about the type, frequency and volume of business you have done together
financials
location of data and demographics
competitive data
data that may be sensitive. Your service provider’s use of any such sensitive data requires your explicit consent
How we obtain data about you
We don’t typically collect information directly from individuals. Our clients gather information about their customers or employees and then upload that data onto our platform (either directly or by using the assistance of a third party) where they can benefit from the tools and services we provide. Of course, there are exceptions to this rule:
we collect information about our client representatives at sign up or login
we collect technical device information and addresses using cookies and similar technologies
we analyze and capture behaviors of individuals using our platform for analytics purposes only
we use the platform as an internal resource to manage employee and prospect data
we capture event data in logs, tracking systems and service tickets
we monitor and analyze access, traffic, performance and platform activity
Use of the Platform
Clients determine how they will use the platform for the processing of the data they collect. Each may differ in the services they elect to purchase and activate, whether there are customizations, and whether any analytic or third-party integrations will be used. Our client is bound by the terms of their own agreement with us and must also comply with all applicable laws in the proper and legitimate use of your data on Our platform.
What we do in conducting our business
conduct processing requests including analytics on behalf of our (data controller) clients
operate and develop our services;
send information, e.g. invoices, technical notices, updates, security alerts, and support messages
enhance client experience in the use of our services
inform clients and prospective clients about our other products or services (with their consent)
develop new products, integrations and services
distribute surveys
respond to comments and questions and provide customer service
protect against fraudulent, unauthorized, or illegal activities
