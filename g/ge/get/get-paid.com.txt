Your IP address is recorded when you register, so that Get-Paid.com can enforce its one account per person policy.
In the event that you subscribe to or opt-in a Third-Party offer, Get-Paid.com may provide your information to the Third-Party in order to directly faciliate the relationship between you and the advertiser.
Your email address may also be used for tracking purposes, when you complete offers, so that Get-Paid.com can determine that you completed the offers. Get-Paid.com will also use your email address to send you the Get-Paid.com newsletters, unless you have opted out of receiving such newsletters.
