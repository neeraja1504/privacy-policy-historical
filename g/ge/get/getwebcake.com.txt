1. INTRODUCTION
This Privacy Policy is part of the WebCake (the "Company", "we" or "us") End User License Agreement available at License Agreement, and applies to all users of the WebCake toolbar software (the "Software"). The Software is supported by advertising (including search, banner, text link, transitional, interstitial and full page), which is not associated with or endorsed by any underlying websites.
This Privacy Policy describes the collection and use of Software users' personal information (e.g., information that identifies a specific person, such as full name and address), and non-personally identifiable information (e.g., interests, demographics and site usage) to the extent such information is associated with a particular user. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from a child under age 13, please contact us immediately at the email address in the last paragraph below.
2. COLLECTION OF INFORMATION
User Submitted Information
When contacting us, you may submit personal information (such as your full name and other identifying information) to allow us to effectively respond to your inquiry. Your submission is voluntary and you have the choice not to disclose any information to us. Your user submitted information may also include user names associated with third party services, information or content you have permitted third parties to share with the Company, and any information you have made public in connection with third party services. In addition, the Company may supplement user submitted information with other information collected or obtained from third parties.
