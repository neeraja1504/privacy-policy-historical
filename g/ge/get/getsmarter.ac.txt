Collection of Information
Legal Basis for Collecting and Processing Personal Information
GetSmarter collects and processes your personal information when we have lawful bases for doing so. These lawful bases include when you provide consent, when we have a contractual obligation to collect or process your personal data, and when we have a legitimate interest (e.g., to communicate with you regarding the short courses/programs (each, a “Course”), to use data for analytics purposes, to prevent fraud, to report possible criminal acts or threats to public security to a competent authority) in processing your personal information.
Information You Provide
GetSmarter collects information from you when you choose to provide it to us. For example, we may collect your information when you submit a form requesting information about a Course or about other courses offered at other schools, otherwise provide information to us through the Websites, or otherwise contact us. The information we collect may include personal information, such as your contact details, government issued identifier, or other information that can be used to identify you or can be attributed to you, or non-personal information. In some cases, you may choose not to provide us with your information, but we may require it when necessary to perform a contract or to comply with a legal obligation. We also may use information about you for reasons not described in this Privacy Policy where the reason is compatible with the purpose for which we originally collected your information and where such use is lawful.
