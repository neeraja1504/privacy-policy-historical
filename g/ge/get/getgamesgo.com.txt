Website Visitors
Like most website operators, Get Games Go collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Get Games Go's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Get Games Go's visitors use its website. From time to time, Get Games Go may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
Get Games Go also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on Getgamesgo.com blogs/sites.
