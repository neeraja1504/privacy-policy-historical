Notice to European Users
The information You enter on or through An Extension or otherwise provide to us may be transferred outside of the European Union to the United States of America, which does not offer an equivalent level of protection to that required in the European Union.

Article 26 of the European Union's Data Protection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC, 1995 O.J. (L 281) 31) allows for transfer of personal data from the European Union to a third country if the individual has unambiguously given his consent to the transfer of personal information, regardless of the third country's level of protection.
