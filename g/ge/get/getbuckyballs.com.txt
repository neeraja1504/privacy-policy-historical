Buckyballs | Buckycubes | The Amazing Magnetic Desktoy You Can't Put Down
You've heard about our ongoing battle with the CPSC.
Due to their baseless and relentless legal badgering,
we've sadly decided to stop production of Buckyballs and Buckycubes.
We still have a few thousand sets in stock, but once we sell through those, they're gone for good.
Act fast. Tell your friends. Spread the word.
