In some cases, you may choose not to provide us with your information, but we may require it when necessary to perform a contract or to comply with a legal obligation. We also may use information about you for reasons not described in this Privacy Policy where the reason is compatible with the purpose for which we originally collected your information and where such use is lawful.

You will need to ensure that personal information submitted to us is accurate and up-to-date.

How We Disclose Your Information
GetSmarter may share your information with other entities or individuals in the following circumstances:
University Partners: We may share your information with the relevant college or university with which we collaborate on Courses (“University Partner”) in order to process your information, track your participation in the Course, and/or fulfill our contracted responsibilities to the University Partner.
The 2U Family of Companies: Where you have expressed interest and given your consent, we may share your information with our parent company, 2U, Inc., and within the 2U family of companies to provide you with information about other educational programs.
Service Providers: We may share your information with our service providers that provide business, professional, or technical support functions for us. In particular, we use third-party providers of website hosting, maintenance, marketing services, courier services, certification services, business operations, payment services, and identity verification services. These service providers are only given access to your information to the extent necessary to process your information and/or provide services to GetSmarter, and they are prohibited from using or share your information for any other purposes. GetSmarter may disclose limited information about you to Service Providers to serve relevant advertising on third party platforms to you or to other audiences.

We may disclose your information to protect the security of the Course, the Websites, servers, network systems, and databases. We also may disclose your information as necessary if we believe that there has been a violation of our Terms of Use (including investigation of potential violations thereof), any other legal document or contract related to the Websites, or the rights of any third party.
Fraud; Security: We may access and disclose your information to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or other technical issues.
Consent; Other: We may share information with third parties when we have your consent, or otherwise as described to you at the point of collection.
Sale or Transfer of Business or Assets: GetSmarter may sell or purchase assets during the normal course of our business. If another entity acquires us or any of our assets, information we have collected about you may be transferred to such entity. In addition, if any bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding is brought by or against us, such information may be considered an asset of ours and may be sold or transferred to third parties. Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to try to require that the transferee use your information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.
De-Identified Aggregate or Anonymous Information: GetSmarter may also share de-identified aggregate or anonymous information with third parties for their marketing or analytics uses. For example, we provide Google Analytics with de-identified data so that they may provide us with a better understanding of visitors’ interactions with the Websites, including actions a visitor takes while accessing the Websites or sites to which a visitor navigates after leaving the Websites. Learn more about Google Analytics’ use of de-identified data, and how to opt out of such use with a browser add-on, here.
International Transfers: We transfer personal information from the European Economic Area (“EEA”) to other countries, including the United States and South Africa, some of which have not been designated by the European Commission as having an adequate level of data protection. In these instances, we use Standard Contractual Clauses to meet the adequacy requirement. Where information is transferred outside the EEA to a third party in a country that is not subject to an adequacy decision by the EU Commission, data is adequately protected by Standard Contractual Clauses, an appropriate Privacy Shield certification or a vendor’s Processor Binding Corporate Rules. A copy of the relevant mechanism can be provided for your review on request to privacy@getsmarter.com or via our contact page.
For California Residents: If you do not want GetSmarter to disclose your information to third parties (including affiliated third parties which may not share the GetSmarter name) for their direct marketing purposes, you may opt out of such disclosure by contacting us at privacy@getsmarter.com or on our contact page.
Information Security and Data Retention
We are committed to protecting the security of your information. We maintain what we believe to be appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure your information and to prevent unauthorized access, maintain accuracy, and ensure appropriate use of your information. The accuracy, safety, and security of your information also depend on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of the Websites, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask that you not share your password with anyone. Even though we do our best to protect your information, transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure, and we cannot guarantee our security measures. We are not responsible for any unauthorized access to or acquisition of your information.
We will retain your personal information for the length of time needed to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.
Your Rights Regarding Your Personal Information
You may access and/or update your personal information through your user profile.
In some instances, you may have the right under applicable law to: (a) ask us for a copy of your personal information; (b) correct, delete or restrict processing of your personal information; and (c) obtain the personal information you provide to us in a structured, machine readable format. In addition, you may have the right under applicable law to object to the processing of your personal information in some circumstances. If you would like to inquire about your right to object to the processing of your personal information for direct marketing purposes, you may contact us at privacy@getsmarter.com.
Your rights regarding your personal information may be limited in certain circumstances, for example, if fulfilling your request would reveal personal information about another person or would infringe the rights of a third party (including our rights), or if you ask us to delete information which we are required by law to keep or have compelling legitimate interests in keeping. We will inform you of relevant exemptions we rely upon when responding to any request you make.
Our use of certain personal information is necessary for us to provide information to you about the Course or to provide services to you through the Websites or otherwise. If you choose not to provide this personal information or request that GetSmarter delete or restrict the processing of this personal information, you may not be able to participate in the Course, and we may not be able to provide you with other services, including those provided through the Websites or advertised about the Course.
If you believe your rights regarding your personal information have been infringed upon, please contact us as set forth in the “Additional Information” section below. If you are located in the EEA or Switzerland and have unresolved concerns, you also have a right to lodge a complaint with the applicable data protection authorities.
To the extent the above rights apply in your country, they may be limited in some situations, for example, if GetSmarter is under a legal requirement to retain certain information. If you wish to make a request described in this section, or if you are otherwise unable to access and/or edit your personal information through your user profile, you may contact us at privacy@getsmarter.com or use the Data Enquiry Form.

Public Forums; Publicly Available Content
Any information you may disclose through the Websites, such as on message boards, in chat rooms, or on other public areas on the Websites, may be viewed by others, such as your classmates and learning facilitators. Please exercise caution when disclosing personal information in these public areas. You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of all information submitted to the Websites, and you agree to only publish or share information about a third party with the third party’s consent.

Third-Party Content, Links, and Plug-Ins
The Websites may also offer you the ability to interact with plugins from social media sites, which may allow us and/or the social media site to receive data from or about you, to better understand who is using the Websites, how people are using the Websites, how to improve the effectiveness of the Websites, our services and related content, to help us or those third parties serve more targeted advertising to you across the Internet, and to allow “Like” buttons and “Share” buttons to work. In some cases, we may know that you clicked on a social plugin, such as a Twitter Follow button, or receive other information from the social media sites. Similarly, if you have previously provided personal information to a third party operating a plug-in on our Websites, then such third party may recognize you on our Websites. Your use of social network plugins is subject to each social media site’s privacy policy, which may be different from ours. As with linked websites, we have no control over the information that is collected, stored, or used by social network plugins.
