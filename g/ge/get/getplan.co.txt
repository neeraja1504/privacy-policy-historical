Plan Privacy Policy
Last Updated: 10 January, 2016
This policy describes how Plan (“Plan,” “we,” and “us”) may use and disclose
information we collect from users (“you”), and your choices about such uses and
disclosures. We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy carefully when using our
application (“service”), visiting our website at www.getplan.co, or transacting business
with us. By using our website or application, you are accepting the practices described
herein.
1. User Information Collection
o   We may collect information that can identify you such as your name and
email address ("personal information") and other information that does not
identify you. We may collect this information through a website or a
mobile application. By using the service, you are authorizing us to gather,
parse and retain data related to the provision of the service.
§   Information you provide. In order to register as a user with Plan,
you will be asked to sign in using your Google account. If you do
so, you authorize us to access certain account information,
including, but not limited to, Calendar and Contacts data.
o   Use of technologies to collect information. We use various technologies to
collect information from your device and about your activities on our
service.
§   Information collected automatically. We automatically collect
information from your browser or device when you access and use
our service. This information could include your IP address, device
ID and type, your browser type and language, the operating system
used by your device, access times, your mobile device’s
geographic location while our application is actively running, and
the referring website address.
§ Cookies and Use of Cookie Data. When you visit our service, we
may assign your device one or more cookies to facilitate access to
our service and to personalize your experience. Through the use of
a cookie, we also may automatically collect information about your
activity on our service, such as the pages you visit, the time and
date of your visits and the links you click. If we advertise, we (or
third parties) may use certain data collected on our service to show
you Plan advertisements on other sites or applications.
§ Other Technologies. We may use standard Internet technology,
such as web beacons and other similar technologies, to track your
use of our service and to deliver or communicate with cookies. We
also may include web beacons in advertisements or email
messages to determine whether messages have been opened and
acted upon. The information we obtain in this manner enables us to
customize the services we offer users, to deliver targeted
advertisements and to measure the overall effectiveness of our
online advertising, content, programming or other activities.
§ Information collected by third parties for advertising
purposes. We may allow service providers, advertising companies
and ad networks, and other third parties to display advertisements
on our service. These companies may use tracking technologies,
such as cookies or web beacons, to collect information about users
who view or interact with their advertisements. We provide
personal information in a non-identifying manner to third parties.
Some of these third-party advertising companies may be
advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising
Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting
from member companies (www.networkadvertising.org). Opting
out will not decrease the number of advertisements you see.
How we use collected information
o  We may use information that we collect about you to:
§   deliver and improve our products and services, and manage our
business;
§   manage your account and provide you with customer support;
§   perform research and analysis about your use of, or interest in, our
or others’ products, services, or content;
§   communicate with you by email, postal mail, telephone and/or
mobile devices about products or services that may be of interest to
you either from us or other third parties;
§   develop, display, and track content and advertising tailored to your
interests on our service and other sites, including providing our
advertisements to you when you visit other sites;
§   website or mobile application analytics;
§   verify your eligibility and deliver prizes in connection with
contests and sweepstakes;
§   enforce or exercise any rights in our Terms of Use; and
§   perform functions or services as otherwise described to you at the
time of collection.
o  Job applicants. If your personal information is submitted through our
website when applying for a position with our company, the information
will be used solely in connection with considering and acting upon your
application. We may retain your personal information, but only for the
purpose of considering your application for current or future available
positions. This information, which may include your name and contact
information, prior education and experience, and other information you
provide to us, may be shared with third-party service providers retained by
us to collect, maintain and analyze candidate submissions for job postings.
In all circumstances, we may perform these functions directly or use a
third party vendor to perform these functions on our behalf who will be
obligated to use your personal information only to perform services for us.
Also, if you access our service from a third party social platform, such as
Facebook, we may share non-personal information with that platform to
the extent permitted by your agreement with it and its privacy settings.
With whom we share your information
o  Personal information. We do not share your personal information with
others except as indicated in this Privacy Policy or when we inform you
and give you an opportunity to opt out of having your personal
information shared. We may share personal information with:
§    Service providers: We may share information, including personal
and financial information, with third parties that perform certain
services on our behalf. These services may include fulfilling
orders, providing customer service and marketing assistance,
performing business and sales analysis, ad tracking and analytics,
member screenings, supporting our service functionality, and
supporting contests, sweepstakes, surveys and other features
offered through our service. These service providers may have
access to personal information needed to perform their functions
but are not permitted to share or use such information for any other
purposes.
§   Other Situations. We may disclose your information, including
personal information:
§  In response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand,
a court order, or a request for cooperation from a law
enforcement or other government agency; to establish or
exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or
as otherwise required by law. In such cases, we may raise
or waive any legal objection or right available to us.
§  When we believe disclosure is appropriate in connection
with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take other action
regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other
wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property or
safety of our company, our users, our employees, or others;
to comply with applicable law or cooperate with law
enforcement; or to enforce our Terms of Use or other
agreements or policies.
§  In connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such
as the sale of our business, a divestiture, merger,
consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of
bankruptcy.
o Aggregated and/or non-personal information. We may use and share non-
personal information we collect under any of the above circumstances. We
may also share it with third parties to develop and deliver targeted
advertising on our service and on websites or applications of third parties,
and to analyze and report on advertising you see. We may combine non-
personal information we collect with additional non- personal information
collected from other sources. We also may share aggregated, non-personal
information, or personal information in hashed, non-human readable form,
with third parties, including advisors, advertisers and investors, for the
purpose of conducting general business analysis or other business
purposes. For example, we may engage a data provider who may collect
web log data from you (including IP address and information about your
browser or operating system), or place or recognize a unique cookie on
your browser to enable you to receive customized ads or content. The
cookies may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data
you voluntarily have submitted to us (such as your email address), that we
may share with a data provider solely in hashed, non-human readable
form. To opt-out of cookies that may be set by third party data or
advertising partners, please go to http:// www.aboutads.info/choices/.
Your choices about collection and use of your information
o   You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may
result in you being unable to use certain features of our service because
such information may be required in order for you to register as user;
purchase products or services; participate in a contest, promotion, survey,
or sweepstakes; ask a question; or initiate other transactions.
o   Our service may also deliver notifications to your phone or mobile device.
You can disable these notifications by deleting the relevant service or by
changing the settings on your mobile device.
o   You can also control information collected by cookies. You can delete or
decline cookies by changing your browser settings. Click “help” in the
toolbar of most browsers for instructions.
How we protect your personal information
We take security measures to help safeguard your personal information from
unauthorized access and disclosure. However, no system can be completely
secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not
promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, chats, or
other communications will always remain secure. Users should also take care with
how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending
personal information through insecure email. Please refer to the Federal Trade
Commission's website at http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm for
information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.
6. Information you provide about yourself while using our service
We provide areas on our service where you can post information about yourself
and others and communicate with others. Such postings are governed by our
Terms of Use. Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on
publicly-viewable pages, that information will be publicly available and can be
collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address, you
may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or
what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we
encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal
information.
7. Children's privacy
Although our service is a general audience service, we restrict the use of our
service to individuals age 13 and above. We do not knowingly collect, maintain,
or use personal information from children under the age of 13.
8. Visiting our service from outside the United States
If you are visiting our service from outside the United States, please be aware that
your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States
and globally where our servers are located and our central database is operated.
By using our services, you understand and agree that your information may be
transferred to our facilities and those third parties with whom we share it as
described in this privacy policy.
No Rights of Third Parties
This Privacy Policy does not create rights enforceable by third parties or require
disclosure of any personal information relating to users of the website.
Changes to this Privacy Policy
We will sometimes update this Privacy Policy. When we post changes to this
Privacy Policy, we will revise the "Last Updated" date at the top of this Privacy
Policy. We recommend that you check our service from time to time to inform
yourself of any changes in this Privacy Policy or any of our other policies.
