We collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data, as described below.
(a) Information You Provide to Us

Other information, such as your mailing address, telephone number, professional title and/or company name may be collected by us if you, voluntarily, provide us with such information.

(b) Information You Provide to Social Networking Sites.
The Services allow users to access Social Networking Sites to interact with friends and to share on Social Networking Sites. Any information that we collect from your Social Networking Sites account may depend on the privacy settings you have with that Social Networking Sites, so please consult the Social Networking Site’s privacy and data practices.
(c) Information Collected via Technology.
_ As most web services, we gather data on your patterns of using Narrative’s services. Please see the full paragraph for details on what data is gathered.  _
·        _ Information Collected by Our Servers  _ . To make our Site and Services more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) collect information from you, including your browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, and/or a date/time stamp for your visit.
·        _ Log Files  _ . As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (“ISP”), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users’ movements around the Site, gather demographic information about our user base as a whole, and better tailor our Services to our users’ needs. For example, some of the information may be collected so that when you visit the Site or the Services again, it will recognize you and the information could then be used to serve advertisements and other information appropriate to your interests. We do not link this automatically-collected data to Personal Data, other than to provide you with personalized content on our Site.
·        _ Cookies  _ . Like many online services, we use cookies to collect information. “Cookies” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing the website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site. This type of information is collected to make the Site more useful to you and to tailor the experience with us to meet your special interests and needs.
·        _ Pixel Tags  _ . In addition, we use “Pixel Tags” (also referred to as clear Gifs, Web beacons, or Web bugs). Pixel Tags are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in function to Cookies, that are used to track online movements of Web users. In contrast to Cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, Pixel Tags are embedded invisibly in Web pages. Pixel Tags also allow us to send e-mail messages in a format users can read, and they tell us whether e-mails have been opened to ensure that we are sending only messages that are of interest to our users. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to a user. We do not tie the information gathered by Pixel Tags to our users’ Personal Data.
·        _ Flash LSOs  _ . When we post videos, third parties may use local shared objects, known as “Flash Cookies,” to store your preferences for volume control or to personalize certain video features. Flash Cookies are different from browser Cookies because of the amount and type of data and how the data is stored. Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash Cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash Cookies,   click here   .
·        _ Mobile Services  _ . We may also collect non-personal information from your mobile device if you have downloaded our Application(s). This information is generally used to help us deliver the most relevant information to you. Examples of information that may be collected and used include your geographic location, how you use the Application(s), and information about the type of device you use. In addition, in the event our Application(s) crash on your mobile device, we will receive information about your mobile device model software version and device carrier, which allows us to identify and fix bugs and otherwise improve the performance of our Application(s). This information is sent to us as aggregated information and is not traceable to any individual and cannot be used to identify an individual.
·        _ Google Analytics  _ . We use Google Analytics to help analyze how users use the Site. Google Analytics uses Cookies to collect information such as how often users visit the Site, what pages they visit, and what other sites they used prior to coming to the Site. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve our Site and Services. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit the Site, rather than your name or other personally identifying information. We do not combine the information generated through the use of Google Analytics with your Personal Data. Although Google Analytics plants a persistent Cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit the Site, the Cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Site is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy.
(d) Information Collected from You About Others.
_ Please make sure you have the potential consent needed from a third party you invite to Narrative.  _
If you decide to invite a third party to create an Account, we will collect your and the third party’s names and e-mail addresses in order to send an e-mail and follow up with the third party. We rely upon you to obtain whatever consents from the third party that may be required by law to allow us to access and upload the third party’s names and e-mail addresses as required above. You or the third party may contact us at care@getnarrative.com to request the removal of this information from our database.
(e) Information Collected from Third Party Companies.
_ Other companies’ data on you may be shared with us from time to time. Please make sure you have agreed to these companies sharing your information.  _
We may receive Personal and/or Anonymous Data about you from companies that provide our Services by way of a co-branded or private-labeled website or companies that offer their products and/or services on our Site. These third party companies may supply us with Personal Data. We may add this information to the information we have already collected from you via our Site in order to improve the Services we provide.
(f) Location Information.
_ You share your location data with Narrative by using Narrative’s products.  _
The Narrative Clip records your location information when it collects photographic information. Via the Clip, we collect your location information to provide you with information about your location. We use third party service providers and serve them with anonymous data in order to further process or refine the location information we provide to you. We never send third party service providers any information that allows them to connect location information to you as an individual user. When you contact us through our Application(s), we will gather information about the country code of your device.
5. Use of Your Personal Data

When we receive feedback through channels that are not available to the public, we always obtain the user’s consent prior to publishing this comment.

When you use the Services, the Personal Data you provide will be shared with the third parties that you designate to receive such information, including other websites, your friends, relatives and business associates. Depending on the type of access you grant to such third parties, they may also be permitted to edit the information you have provided to us and to designate others to access and edit such information. You may change your settings at any time as to who has access to your information by going to your account settings and changing your publishing options.
(b) Users.
_ Other users will only see your personal data if you let them.  _
We will share your Personal data with other Users only if they are designated by you and solely for the purpose of providing the Services.
(c) Third Party Service Providers.
_ To offer Narrative’s products and services, we sometimes need to let third party services see your personal data. These third parties are not allowed to use your data for any other reason than what we request.  _
We may share your Personal Data with third party service providers to: provide you with the Services that we offer you through our Site; to conduct quality assurance testing; to facilitate creation of accounts; to provide technical support; and/or to provide other services to the Company. These third party service providers are required not to use your Personal Data other than to provide the services requested by Company.
(d) Affiliates.
_ We may share your Personal Data with companies we control or are controlled by. This privacy policy governs everyone’s use of your personal data.  _
We may share some or all of your Personal Data with our parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control  (“Affiliates”) , in which case we will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy.
(e) Corporate Restructuring.
_ This privacy policy is tied to Narrative as a company and your personal data Is treated as a company asset.  _
We may share some or all of your Personal Data in connection with or during negotiation of any merger, financing, acquisition or dissolution transaction or proceeding involving sale, transfer, divestiture, or disclosure of all or a portion of our business or assets. In the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, Personal Data may also be transferred as a business asset. If another company acquires our company, business, or assets, that company will possess the Personal Data collected by us and will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Data as described in this Privacy Policy.
(f) Social Networking Sites.
If you choose to share your personal data with a social networking site, you are aware that Narrative cannot guarantee how that site uses your data.
. Some of our Applications and Services may enable you to post content to SNSs (e.g., Facebook or Twitter). If you choose to do this, we will provide information to such SNSs in accordance with your elections. You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for your use of those websites and that it is your responsibility to review the terms of use and privacy policy of the third party provider of such SNSs. We will not be responsible or liable for: (i) the availability or accuracy of such SNSs; (ii) the content, products or services on or availability of such SNSs; or (iii) your use of any such SNSs.
(g) Public Profile.
_ Nothing of the information you provide us with is made public unless you explicitly post it to publicly available parts of our Site and Services. Be careful what data you make public.  _
Certain portions of the information you provide to us may also be displayed in your Profile. By default, your Personal Data is private and available only to you. If you provide certain information in public parts of your profile, such information will be public. Your photos, posts, friends, and other content that you choose to make public, either by posting on the Site or by other means, are also meant for public consumption. We may display this content on the Site and further distribute it to a wider audience through third party sites and services. Once displayed on publicly viewable web pages, that information can be collected and used by others. We cannot control who reads your postings or what other users may do with the information that you voluntarily post, so it is very important that you do not put Personal Data in your posts. Just like with any other information shared on the Internet, once you have posted information publicly, while you will still be able to edit and delete it on the Site, you will not be able to edit or delete such information cached, collected, and stored elsewhere by others (e.g., search engines).
(h) Other Disclosures.
_ Narrative will never disclose your content with anyone else unless either you have voluntarily shared it yourself or if we have very strong reasons to believe we very much have to comply to a formally filed request. In the latter case, we will always inform you on the request and give you the option to disclose the requested content yourself. Narrative will always do everything reasonable possible to protect your content.  _
While Narrative will not disclose Your Content and/or information to any governments or entities without your expressed consent, we will share Content if we receive a request to do so, and
a)if we believe in good faith that we have no legal options to refuse such a request; e.g. in connection with a legal investigation, to comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on the Company;
b) if it is necessary to protect the safety of any person from death or serious bodily injury,
c) if it is necessary to protect and defend us or any of our users from fraud or abuse or in defense of our or our users’ rights of property; or
d) to investigate or assist in preventing any violation or potential violation of the law, this Privacy Policy, or our Terms of Use.
If we are presented with such a request, Narrative will notify all affected users by e-mail, no matter whether we determine that data should be disclosed. Upon receipt of such information, you will be given the opportunity to actively consent to disclosure of content and/or information to the specified government or entity for the specified purpose at the specified time. If you consent to disclosing information, Narrative will comply with the request in question without making further investigations of the lawfulness nor any other aspects of the request. If you do not consent, we will make reasonable investigations to ensure that one or more of the above criteria are fulfilled by the request to disclose data. If we find that the request is not in compliance with any of the aforementioned criteria, we will refuse to disclose the content.
If we provide your Narrative files to a law enforcement agency as set forth above, we will remove Narrative’s encryption from the files before providing them to law enforcement.
** Third Party Websites.  ** Our Site may contain links to third party websites. When you click on a link to any other website or location, you will leave our Site and go to another site, and another entity may collect Personal Data or Anonymous Data from you.

The links to third party websites or locations are for your convenience and do not signify our endorsement of such third parties or their products, content or websites.

We strive to never keep any Personal Data longer than absolutely necessary.
_ You can always uninstall Narrative’s applications. This does not delete your data from our Site and Services.  _

You may use the standard uninstall processes as may be available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network.

8. Transfer of information to other countries
_ Narrative’s servers are located at numerous places in the world and your data may be visiting other countries than your own. The legal rights of these countries may vary, but your data will always be processed as described in this privacy policy.  _
We process information about you on servers located in a number of countries. This means that we may share your information with other Narrative subsidiaries or affiliates for the purpose of them providing you with our services or carrying out any of the activities specified in this Privacy Policy. We may also subcontract this processing to, and subsequently share your information with, third parties located in countries other than your home country. This means that your information can be transferred to, and processed by, companies or other third parties identified above, located in a country outside of the EEA and Switzerland, where you may have fewer legal rights in relation to your information.

For more information on how payments are handled, or to understand the data security and privacy afforded such information, please refer to the Privacy policies of Shopify, PayPal and Braintree respectively.
