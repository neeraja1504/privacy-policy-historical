Although you are entering into an Agreement with Rocketbook to disclose your Personal Information to us, we do use third party individuals and organizations to assist us, including contractors, web hosts, and others.
For our legitimate business interests, we use third party individuals and organizations to assist us, including contractors, web hosts, and others.  We shall ask and require these third parties to implement appropriate organizational and technical security measures to protect against unauthorized disclosure of personal data, and only to process personal data in accordance with our instructions and applicable laws, and to the extent necessary to provide their services to us.

Your information may be transferred to—and maintained on—computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, Rocketbook transfers Personal Information to the United States and processes it there. Your consent to this Policy followed by your submission of such Personal Information represents your agreement to that transfer.
We also may use certain reputable third parties, some of whom may be located outside of the European Economic Area, to provide us with certain specialized services related to the Platform. These third parties will have access to certain information about you, but only where this is necessary in order for those third parties to provide their services to us. Where we transfer personal data to these third parties, we ask and require these third parties to implement appropriate organizational and technical security measures to protect against unauthorized disclosure of personal data, and only to process personal data in accordance with our instructions and to the extent necessary to provide their services to us.
We are dedicated to protecting the privacy of your Personal Information when working with third parties. It is our policy to request that our third-party providers sign a written agreement confirming that they will use Personal Information or other information we share with them solely for the purpose to assist us and not for anything outside the scope of the services they are providing to us. While we may not always be successful in obtaining such an agreement for various reasons, we nevertheless attempt to facilitate access only to those third-party providers that share our respect for your privacy and adhere to privacy and security obligations in a manner consistent with our own policies and/or commercially reasonable practices; however, we cannot take responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of those third-party providers.
It is therefore necessary that you grant the third parties we may use in the course of our business the same rights that you afford us under this Policy. For this reason, you hereby agree that for every authorization which you grant to us in this Policy, you also grant to any third party that we may hire, contract, or otherwise retain the services of for the purpose of operating, maintaining, repairing, or otherwise improving or preserving our website or its underlying files or systems. You agree not to hold us liable for the actions of any of these third parties, even if we would normally be held vicariously liable for their actions, and that you must take legal action against them directly should they commit any tort or other actionable wrong against you.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you authorize us to collect, share, store, and otherwise use your information from time to time in conjunction with various applications and solutions that enable us to better manage our communications with you and improve the Service.
