We operate using IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our servers. Your IP address is used to help identify you and your wagering account.
GoTo Entertainment also logs IP addresses for system administration purposes. IP addresses are logged to track a user's session. This gives us an idea what parts of our site users are visiting. We do not link IP address to anything personally identifiable. This means that a user's session will be tracked, but the user will remain anonymous. However in cases of suspected fraud, it is possible for our system developers to review these log files and correlate them with individual player accounts and thereby establish with a high degree of certainty what happened and who was involved.
