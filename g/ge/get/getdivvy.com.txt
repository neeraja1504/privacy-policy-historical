Privacy Policy - Divvy
Divvy knows the importance of, and values the privacy of all its customers.  We understand that you care about how your personal information is collected, used and shared, and we take this responsibility seriously. Our primary goal is to provide you with exceptional service, and we understand that you may have questions or concerns regarding your personal information and how it will be used. You may also email us at info@getdivvy.com with any privacy-related questions.
APPLICABILITY OF PRIVACY POLICY

By using or accessing our web and mobile application (“Divvy Services”), you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies delineated in this Privacy Policy, and you hereby consent that we will collect, use, and share your information in the ways defined. This Privacy Policy, or its future variation, will continue to apply if your use of our Services is discontinued by either you or us. This policy only applies to the Divvy Service(s) and does not apply to the practices of any other partner or third party provider.
In this policy, the term “personal information” is used to describe information that can be associated with a specific individual and can be used to identify that person. We do not consider personal information to include information that has been anonymized so that it does not identify a specific user.

We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us. For example, you will provide information while setting up your funding source, such as by providing name, addresses, business identification numbers, social security number, etc. You may also provide information through the registration process or save information on your device or account settings such as your name, email address, and phone number.

For fraud prevention purposes, we also may link your machine ID with the machines of others who use your same payment cards.
Financial Information – bank account and routing numbers and credit cards linked to your Divvy account. Divvy does not share financial information with third party social networking services such as those listed in the prior bullet.
We are committed to providing a safe, secure and all around great service. Therefore, before permitting you to use our Service, we may require additional information from you we can use to verify your identity, address or other information or to manage risk and compliance throughout our relationship. We may also obtain information about you from third parties such as identity verification, fraud prevention and similar services.
When you are using the Divvy Service, we collect information about your account transactions and trust relationships and we may collect information about your computer or other access device for fraud prevention and other similar purposes.

INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN
As noted in the Terms and Conditions, we do not knowingly solicit or collect information from any individuals under the age of 18. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 18, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.
HOW WE USE COOKIES
When you access the website, we, or companies we hire to track how our website is used, may place small data files called “cookies” on your computer.
For example, we send a “session cookie” to your computer any time you log in to your Divvy account. This type of cookie helps us to recognize you if you visit multiple pages on our site during the same session, so that we don’t need to ask you for your password on each page.
You are free to decline Divvy cookies if your browser permits, but doing so may interfere with your use of the website.
HOW WE PROTECT & STORE PERSONAL INFORMATION
We store and process your personal information using third party servers located in secure data centers in the United States. The information is protected by physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in compliance with applicable US federal and state regulations. We employ electronic safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption and we enforce physical access controls to our office and files. We authorize access to personal information only for those employees who require it to fulfill their job responsibilities.
We make reasonable efforts to ensure security on our systems. Despite our efforts, we cannot guarantee that personal information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of our administrative, managerial and technical safeguards. Therefore, we urge you to take adequate precautions to protect your personal data as well, including never sharing your Divvy password with anyone.
If Divvy learns of a systems security breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. By using the Divvy Service, you agree that Divvy may communicate with you electronically. Divvy may post a notice on the website if a security breach occurs. We may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice of a security breach) you should notify us.

Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient, fun and customized experience. We may use your personal information to:

HOW WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION WITHIN THE DIVVY NETWORK
To process payments on Divvy, we need to share some of your personal information with the person or company that you are paying or is paying you. Your contact information, date of sign-up, the number of payments you have received and other verification metrics like social graph activity may be provided to users or companies when you transact with, on, or through Divvy.
We work with vendors to enable them to accept payments from you using Divvy. In doing so, a vendor may share information about you with us, such as your mobile phone number or Divvy username, when you attempt to pay that vendor. We use this information to confirm to that vendor that you are a Divvy customer and that the vendor should enable Divvy as a form of payment for your purchase.
Regardless, we will not disclose your credit card number or bank account number to anyone you have paid or who has paid you through Divvy, except with your express permission or if we are required to do so to comply with a subpoena or other legal process.

Third party service providers who assist us in providing services to you or who provide fraud detection or similar services on our [or any vendor’s] behalf.
Service providers under contract who help with parts of our business operations (for example, fraud prevention, payment processing, or technology services); Our contracts dictate that these service providers only use your information in connection with the services they perform for us and not for their own benefit.
