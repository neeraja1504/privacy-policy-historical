Cookies
Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we may transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.
On our Site, we may use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate the Site by saving your preferences and to improve and track the overall Site experience. For our password protected areas of the Site, we may set a persistent cookie to authenticate your login and authorization to use the password protected areas.
Get Lighthouse does not track its customers over time and across third party websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals. However, this Site also uses several web analytics service providers, such as Google Analytics (“Google”), Mixpanel and Intercom (collectively, "Web Analytics Providers"). These Web Analytics Providers use "cookies", which are text files placed on your computer, to help the website analyze how users use the site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the Site (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by the Web Analytics Providers on servers in the United States. The Web Analytics Providers will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Site, compiling reports on Site activity for Site operators and providing other services relating to Site activity and internet usage. The Web Analytics Providers may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on behalf of such Web Analytics Providers. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. You may find more information about Mixpanel or Intercom at their respective websites. The Web Analytics Providers may track your use of this Site as well as across other third party websites.

Get Lighthouse will enter into a written agreement with such third party requiring that the third party provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by this Privacy Policy or any other applicable Get Lighthouse privacy and data protection commitments. Unless we give you the choice to opt-out and you do not exercise your opt-out right, we do not provide Get Lighthouse’s service providers with any right to use personal data we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us or for a purpose incompatible with the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you.
