How We Share Your Information
Onward Transfers to Third Parties
We may engage other companies and individuals to perform certain business-related functions on our behalf. Examples may include providing technical assistance, payment processing, billing, email management, order fulfillment, customer service, and marketing assistance. These other companies will have access to the information only as necessary to perform their functions and to the extent permitted by law. All such third parties function as our agents, performing services at our instruction and on our behalf pursuant to contracts which require they provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by this Privacy Policy and implemented by us. We may also disclose personal information to our affiliates in order to support marketing, sale and delivery of products and services.
Aggregate Information
In an ongoing effort to better understand our Visitors, and Subscribers, we may analyze your information in anonymized and aggregate form in order to operate, maintain, manage, and improve the Website and the Platform and for our own research purposes. This aggregate information does not identify you personally. We may share this aggregate data with our affiliates, agents, and business partners. We may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our products and services to current and prospective business partners and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.
Business Transfers
In the event of a merger, dissolution or similar corporate event, or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, we expect that the information that we have collected, including personal information, would be transferred to the surviving entity in a merger or the acquiring entity. All such transfers shall be subject to our commitments with respect to the privacy and confidentiality of such personal information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
Legal Requirements
We may disclose your information if required to do so by law, or in the good faith belief that such action or disclosure is necessary or appropriate to: (i) operate the Platform, (ii) comply with any legal obligation, report unlawful activity, cooperate with law enforcement or public authorities (including for the purpose of meeting national security or law enforcement requirements), (iii) protect against legal liability, (iv) protect and defend our rights, property, personnel, suppliers, sponsors, agents or licensors, (v) protect the personal safety of vendors, users of the Platform or the public, or (vi) comply when compelled to disclose personal information to other third parties by government authorities or as required by law or regulation, including, but not limited to, in response to court orders and subpoenas.
Third-Party Applications
With your permission, third-party applications or services may access your personal information. We use standard OAuth (open authorization) to enable you to update and manage public content on third-party websites, such as Facebook or Twitter, and integrate with other third-party service providers (e.g., payment processors, analytics providers, marketing automation) from within the Platform. For the sole purpose of enabling such features via OAuth, BentoBox must request certain access permissions to your account(s) on such third-party websites.
Communication Preferences
Anyone who has signed up to use the Platform may access, remove, review, and/or make changes to the same by following the instructions found on the Platform. In addition, you may manage your receipt of marketing and non-transactional communications by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link located on the bottom of any BentoBox marketing e-mail. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to process such requests in a timely manner. You should be aware, however, that it is not always possible to completely remove or modify information in our subscription databases. Subscribers cannot opt out of receiving transactional e-mails related to their account with BentoBox. Retention of personal information
We will retain your personal information in a form that identifies you only for as long as it serves the purpose(s) for which it was initially collected as stated in this Privacy Policy, or subsequently authorized. We may continue processing your personal information for longer periods, but only for the time and to the extent such processing reasonably serves the purposes of archiving in the public interest, journalism, literature and art, scientific or historical research and statistical analysis, and subject to the protection of this Privacy Policy. After such time periods have expired, we may either delete your personal information or retain it in a form such that it does not identify you personally.
How We Protect Your Information
BentoBox takes very seriously the security and privacy of the personal information that it collects pursuant to this Privacy Policy. Accordingly, we will implement reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect your personal information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, taking into account the risks involved in processing and the nature of such data, and comply with applicable laws and regulations. Please understand, however, that no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that the information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to and from us over the Internet. In particular, e-mail sent to or from the Platform may not be secure, and you should therefore take special care in deciding what information you send to us via e-mail.
Children
We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not give us any personal information. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children to never provide us personal information without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided personal information to us, please contact us at privacy@getbento.com, and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.
Important Notice to All Non-US Residents
Our Website, Platform, and their servers are located in the US. If you are located outside of the US, please be aware that any information provided to us, including personal information, will be transferred from your country of origin to the US. Except in the case of data transfers under the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, your decision to provide such data to us, or allow us to collect such data through our Website and/or the Platform constitutes your consent to this data transfer.
Important Notice for Individuals of the European Economic Area and Switzerland
BentoBox complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries (as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway) and Switzerland transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield. BentoBox has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to such data. If there is any conflict between the policies in this privacy policy and data subject rights under the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.

Pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks, EU and Swiss individuals have the right to obtain our confirmation of whether we maintain personal information relating to you in the United States. Upon request, we will provide you with access to the personal information that we hold about you. You may also may correct, amend, or delete the personal information we hold about you. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data transferred to the United States under Privacy Shield, should contact us at privacy@getbento.com, with the subject line, “Privacy Shield.” We may require payment of a non-excessive fee to defray our expenses in this regard. Please allow us a reasonable time to respond to your inquiries and requests.
We will not disclose your sensitive personal information to any third party without first obtaining your opt-in consent. You may grant such consent by contacting us at privacy@getbento.com, with the subject line, “ Privacy Shield ”. In each instance, please allow us a reasonable time to process your response.
We will provide an individual opt-out choice, before we share your data with third parties other than our agents, or before we use it for a purpose other than which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized. To request to limit the use and disclosure of your personal information, please submit a written request to privacy@getbento.com, with the subject line, “ Privacy Shield ”.
In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

BentoBox’s accountability for personal data that it receives in the United States under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to a third party is described in the Privacy Shield Principles. In particular, BentoBox remains responsible and liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if third-party agents that it engages to process the personal data on its behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless BentoBox proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, BentoBox commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield. European Union and Swiss individuals with Privacy Shield inquiries or complaints should first contact BentoBox at privacy@getbento.com with the subject line, “ Privacy Shield ”.
BentoBox has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the Privacy Shield Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD, operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers for more information and to file a complaint. This service is provided free of charge to you.
If your Privacy Shield complaint cannot be resolved through the above channels, under certain conditions, you may invoke binding arbitration for some residual claims not resolved by other redress mechanisms. See Privacy Shield Annex 1 at https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-introduction.
