•       To provide users with information and/or offers for products or services from us or third parties;
•       To track online behavior for behavioral advertising and other marketing purposes. Behavioral advertising enables us and our third party marketing partners to deliver to users what is hoped to be more relevant information and/or offers for products or services.  We may share this and other Information we collect with our third party marketing partners who compensate may us.  If you entered your registration information on the www.samplesandsavings.com Website, your email address will only be shared with our mailing partner All Inbox, LLC who may send relevant third party emails on a daily basis;

** SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION**
We use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, or accidental loss or destruction of your Information. We currently do not encrypt Information that we store.  Given the nature of the Internet, your Information passes through entities that we are unable to control.  Therefore, we cannot guarantee that our security measures or those of third parties who access or transmit your Information will prevent your Information from being illegally accessed, stolen or altered.

Users may opt-out from receiving future offers from us by following the Opt-Out instructions contained in the marketing communication or by clicking here.  If you receive offers or other communications from our third party marketing partners and would like to opt-out from future communications from them, you should contact them directly.  A third party’s use of Information is subject to their privacy policy and  we have no control or responsibility over their use.

The California “Shine the Light” law permits users who are California residents to request information regarding our disclosure of their Information to third parties including the categories of Information shared and a list of the names and addresses of third parties with whom the Information was shared.  If you are a California resident and would like a copy of this notice, please submit a written request to the following address:  www.SamplesAndSavings.com  – Privacy Officer, 128 Court Street, 3rd Floor, White Plains, NY  10601.  In your request, please specify that you want "Your www.SamplesAndSavings.com
California Privacy Rights Notice."  Please allow 30 days for a response.
Browser “Do Not Track” Signals:   Most browsers contain a “do-not-track” setting.  In general, when a “do-not-track” setting is active, the user’s browser notifies other websites that the user does not want their personal information and online behavior to be tracked and used, for example, for behavioral advertising.  As required by recent Shine the Light law amendments we are required to inform you that, as is the case with most websites, we do not honor or alter our behavior when a user to our Site has activated the “do-not-track” setting on his/her browser.
CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY
We may change this Policy at any time. If we make material changes to this Policy, we will post a notice on our Websites and update the revision date which is at the top.  Revisions that expand the types or the scope of our use of the Information we collect will be effective 30 days after posting to a Website and will apply to all Information we collect after the effective date.  Your access and use of a Website following a revision will be deemed your acceptance of such revision. Users should periodically visit this page to review the current policies with regard to Information.
