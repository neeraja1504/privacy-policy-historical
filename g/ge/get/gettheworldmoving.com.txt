Privacy Policy
Virgin Pulse is committed to protecting your rights and your privacy. This Privacy Policy (the “ Policy ”) explains what data We collect about you and how We store, analyze and share the data We collect about you through the platform (virginhealthst.wpengine.com) and the Virgin Pulse mobile application. The Policy also explains your rights with regards to your data, and how to contact us to request access, corrections, transfer, restriction or deletion of the data We have collected about you. Nothing in this Policy limits your rights under applicable laws, including your ability, depending on your country of residence, to file a complaint with your local Data Protection Authority.
Please carefully read through this Policy. To join the Program and enjoy the Virgin Pulse services and Program benefits, you are required to accept all the terms in this Policy. If you choose to accept these terms and enroll in the Virgin Pulse Program, you will become a Member of the Program. We may update the terms of this Policy from time to time to reflect changes in Our information practices. If We make any material changes to these terms, you will be notified via an update notice, and you will be given the opportunity to review and accept these terms prior to being able to access the platform or continue to use the Program. You may withdraw your consent to this Policy or its updated terms at any time by contacting Us and notifying Us that you wish to terminate your Membership.
Please note that any translation of this Policy is intended solely to facilitate your access to this information. The English version is the only official version of this Policy and any translation inaccuracies or discrepancies are not binding and have no legal effect for compliance or enforcement purposes.
What laws and regulations does Virgin Pulse comply with?
The level of data protection established in the USA is lower than the one established in the European Union, therefore, We take measures to ensure that your Personal Information is stored safely with Us, meeting regulatory privacy and security requirements imposed on European Union businesses.
Virgin Pulse will be compliant with the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) on or before the established enforcement date, May 25, 2018.
Virgin Pulse participates in and has certified its compliance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of Personal Information from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States. Virgin Pulse is committed to subjecting all personal data received from European Union (EU) member countries and Switzerland, in reliance on the Privacy Shield Framework, to the Framework’s applicable Principles. To learn more about the Privacy Shield Framework, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield website at https://www.privacyshield.gov . To view and learn more about our certification please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000TOtTAAW&status=Active .
Virgin Pulse is responsible for the processing of personal data it receives, under the Privacy Shield Framework, and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Virgin Pulse complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions.
With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, Virgin Pulse is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, Virgin Pulse may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that We have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at https://www.jamsadr.com/file-an-eu-us-privacy-shield-or-safe-harbor-claim.
Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website at https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint, you may invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.
What information does Virgin Pulse collect about me?
To provide the Virgin Pulse services, We collect anonymous and Personal Information about you. “Personal Information” means any information, including personal and material circumstances, that allows a person to become identifiable. You are under no obligation to provide any Personal Information to Us at any time. However, if you choose to withhold some Personal Information, We may be unable to provide you with certain services.
The definition of “Personal Information” includes, but is not limited to:
Your contact information, including your name and last name, home address, personal and business email addresses, and your phone number;
The email address you use to sign-in;
Your gender, date of birth and age;
Information about your health, fitness and related wellness activities offered within the Program;
Information about your participation and performance in challenges;
The rewards you may be able to earn through Our Program;
The comments and contributions you may make on the web-based platform or mobile application; and
Additional information you may provide as you submit queries and requests to Us.
How does Virgin Pulse collect my Personal Information?
We collect your Personal Information as you submit it through the web-based platform and the mobile application, and by reviewing your use of the web-based platform and mobile application (for example through the use of cookies). Depending on the Program design chosen by your Program Sponsor, We may collect Personal Information through your use of additional services such as the Virgin Pulse Activity Tracking Devices and the Health Stations (additional information on these is provided below). Virgin Pulse may also collect information about you and your participation in the Program through engagement surveys. Additionally, in some cases, your Program Sponsor will have the opportunity to create surveys for its Members to complete, the Virgin Pulse Surveys.
What are the activity tracking devices and how do they track my activity?
As a Program Member you will be able to connect activity trackers to your account. The Virgin Pulse activity tracking devices are the MAX and the MAX BUZZ. These devices track your step activity per minute. From this information, Virgin Pulse is able to determine your total active fitness minutes and calories consumed. Additionally, if you wear the MAX BUZZ to sleep, it can recognize the length of your sleep from how long you lay still.
Other activity tracking devices can track a wide number of different aspects of your daily activities, including, among others, your daily steps and fitness activity, your heartbeat and sleep pattern. Depending on the brand and model of activity tracker you use, the data collected may vary. In general, companies selling activity tracking devices have specific privacy policies available, which outline what data the specific activity tracking device collects. We strongly suggest you review the right privacy policy to know what specific data points your activity tracking device collects about you.
What are Health Stations and what information can I submit by using them?
Depending on the type of Program made available to you by your Program Sponsor, you may have access to Health Stations. Health Stations allow you to measure your blood pressure and weight and input that information in the Program.
Health Stations are measurement tracking stations which may be located, for example, in your office. Depending on your Program, you may receive access to Health Stations in your area at no additional cost.
What information do Virgin Pulse Surveys collect from me?
Depending on your Program design, your Program Sponsor may be able to create and submit customized surveys for its Members to complete. Virgin Pulse does not contribute to the creation of the questions in these surveys, and does not review the questions in these surveys. If you decide to take part in a Virgin Pulse Survey the results will be shared with your Program Sponsor in aggregated reports. Your Program Sponsor will not be able to identify you from these reports. However, if the survey offered gives you the ability to respond to a question by writing in a response, the response will be shared with the Program Sponsor. If you include identifiable Personal Information in these open ended responses, your Program Sponsor may be able to identify you.
What information does Virgin Pulse collect through MyPulse?
Depending on your Program design, you may have access to MyPulse. MyPulse is an assessment that includes the Heart Age survey, which assesses your heart health, and the Lifestyle Score, which assesses your lifestyle across multiple areas of wellbeing. You do not have to complete a MyPulse if you do not want to share this information with Us.
How does Virgin Pulse use my Personal Information?
We will use the Personal Information collected only to provide you with access to our services, including:
To administer and manage your Virgin Pulse account and membership;
To identify you when you sign-in;
To track your progress in the Program and the rewards you earn;

To respond to your questions and requests.
Additionally, We may use your Personal Information to create “Anonymous Data” records by removing any information (including any Contact Information) that would allow the remaining data to be linked back to you. We may use the Anonymous Data for internal purposes, such as analyzing patterns and program usage to improve our services. Additionally, We may use Anonymous Data to analyze and understand demographic trends, customer behavior patterns and preferences, and information that can help Us enrich the content and quality of the Virgin Pulse Program. We reserve the right, subject to applicable laws and regulations, to disclose Anonymous Data at our discretion.
Where and how is my Personal Information and other data stored?
All your data, including any Personal Information We collect about you, is stored at Amazon Web Services data centers located in the United States of America (USA). Because your data is stored on USA soil, it may be subject to USA laws, including the “Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001” (USA PATRIOT Act), as well as the jurisdiction of the USA government, tribunals, law enforcement and regulatory agencies, which may require Virgin Pulse to grant them access to your data.
Is my Personal Information and other data secure?
Virgin Pulse is committed to protecting your data and your privacy. To ensure data security, We follow reasonable physical, electronic and managerial procedures designed to safeguard and secure your data and Personal Information. However, no company can fully eliminate security risks associated with the provision of online services.
Among the security features We use to protect your Personal Information and other data, We require that you create and use a username and unique password to access the web-based platform and mobile application. We use multiple layers of security to protect your Personal Information and data, including firewalls, intrusion detection tools and antivirus.

In the event that such acquisition occurs, the new entity will continue to use your Personal Information within the limits of this Policy, to ensure continuation of service.
Can other Members or my Program Sponsor view my Virgin Pulse profile?
You can become “Friends” with other members of the Program offered by your Program Sponsor. You are able to send “Friend” requests to other Members taking part in your Program, and they will be able to send you “Friend” requests. You can choose to accept or decline these “Friend” requests. You can also choose to remove a “Friend” anytime after adding him or her. If you become “Friends” with another Member, that person will have access to (a) certain portions of your profile, (b) the number of steps you have taken in challenges you choose to participate in, and (c) other activity data related to your participation in the Program.
To the extent that you participate in any wellness challenges or competitions as part of the Virgin Pulse Program, please be aware that your name and performance information will be available to other Members participating in the challenge or competition, and to your Program Sponsor. Additionally, the Virgin Pulse Program may make message boards and messaging forums available to you. Please be aware that any information disclosed in these settings may become public information. You should exercise caution if disclosing Personal Information while using these features.
