Last Updated: August 2016
Nymi Inc. and its divisions, affiliates and subsidiaries (hereinafter "Nymi") respects the privacy and the integrity of any information that is collected through our Web sites, the provision of our products and/or services, or that you otherwise provide to us. This Privacy Policy explains our policy regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information.
This Privacy Policy will be assessed against new technologies, business practices, and our users' needs. As we update, expand, and diversify our products and services, this Privacy Policy may evolve. Please check this Privacy Policy from time to time for updates by checking the date of the "Last Update" at the top of this document. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you here. A link to our Privacy Policy will be provided at the bottom of each web page on our Web sites and any on-line services or programs.
You acknowledge and agree that your access to our Web sites and your use of our products and/or services following any posted changes to the Privacy Policy indicate your acceptance of such changes.
Application of this policy
At Nymi, we are committed to protecting the privacy of our users, which is why we do not sell nor rent any personal information or personally identifiable information regarding our users to any third party. We hope this Privacy Policy will answer your questions regarding how we treat personal information gathered from visitors to our Web sites and users of our products and/or services.
What is personal information
For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, personal information means information that can be used to identify or contact you, such as your name, address, email address, country of residence, as well as other information when such information is combined with your personal information. Personal information does not include "aggregate" anonymous information that does not identify an individual person, which is data we collect about the use of our Web sites and our products and services. Our privacy policy does not restrict or limit our collection and use of aggregate, anonymous information.
Consent
You acknowledge and agree that by accessing our Web sites or using our products and/or services, or otherwise providing us with personal information, you fully understand, accept, and voluntarily consent to the collection, use, retention, and disclosure of personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with any terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use our Web sites, products or services nor submit any personal information to Nymi. It is your choice whether or not you provide us with your personal information; however, a decision to withhold personal information may restrict or prevent us from providing you with a particular product or service. We will only collect, use, and disclose your personal information with your consent, except where otherwise permitted or required by applicable law or regulatory requirement.
Collection of personal information
Should you choose to place an order for products or services, you will need to provide payment information such as credit card numbers, billing addresses and your IP address to our trusted third party service provider. Credit card information, including the card number, expiry date, and security code, is securely collected by our trusted third party service provider. Credit card data is not viewed nor retained by Nymi in any form.
Use of your personal information
You acknowledge and agree that Nymi may use personal information that you voluntarily disclose to us to:
Provide you with information about new products, services, newsletters, informative emails, and research on future product ideas or improvements, where you have agreed to receive such materials;
Provide you with special offers that may be of interest to you and to improve your experience on our Web sites or with our products and services;
Assist us in creating better products and services to meet your needs;
Allow you to purchase and download products, obtain access to services or otherwise engage in activities you select including but not limited to the Nymi Band product;
Provide you with technical support;
Help you quickly find software, services, or product information important to you;
Send transaction-related communications such as welcome letters and product/service order confirmations. Nymi may also send you surveys or marketing communications to inform you of new products or services or other information that may be of interest;
Restrict the availability of some of the products, services, and content to certain parts of the world, where required for legal reasons, by using your address, IP address, and other information in order to enforce those restrictions;
To carry out other purposes that are disclosed to you and to which you consent; and
To carry out any other purpose permitted or required by law.
The Nymi Band allows you to use biometric authentication technology [such as a template of your heart's unique ECG] to confirm your identity and allow you to access devices and services you choose to associate with the Nymi Band using the Nymi Band app. When you use the Nymi Band, an encrypted replica of your ECG signature is recorded and wirelessly transmitted to the device on which you have installed the Nymi Band app, allowing the device to confirm your identity. However, it is important to note that Nymi does not and cannot itself collect, use, view, or have access to your ECG template when you use the Nymi Band and Nymi Band app. Your ECG template is stored in an encrypted state within the Nymi Band and not transmitted to Nymi.
You agree that you are under no obligation to provide us with this information and can access many aspects of our Web sites without providing us any personal information.
While using the Web site, you may have opportunities to post reviews or other personal information in public forums at your own discretion. Please understand that when you post such information, it is public and Nymi is not able to protect it from other persons who may view the public areas of our Web site. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose any personal information in a publicly available forum such as the Web site and agree to release, indemnify, and hold harmless Nymi for any damages or claims resulting from any of your postings. Nymi is not obligated to monitor postings and at its discretion may remove any content submitted.
Disclosure of your personal information
Except as otherwise disclosed to you or required or permitted by applicable law, Nymi will not sell nor rent your personal information to any other party.

However, you agree that Nymi may disclose your personal information in the circumstances set out below:

Nymi may also use, or disclose your personal information to third parties, if we have reason to believe that using or disclosing such information is necessary to: (i) conduct investigations of possible breaches of law; (ii) identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating an agreement they have with us; (iii) investigate security breaches or cooperate with government authorities pursuant to a legal matter or (iv) to protect our rights, safety or property; or

How long we keep personal information
Nymi maintains information about you for as long as we provide a product and/or service to you, and longer for related business activities. After information is no longer necessary for our business purposes, we destroy the information unless there is an outstanding request or order to preserve the information.
Safeguards we have in place
Nymi stores and processes your personal information on computers located in Canada and in the cloud internationally. Nymi employs reasonable physical, organizational, managerial and technical measures to help ensure that your personal information is secure. In addition, our dedicated team of information technology professionals works to maintain data accuracy and help prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information. Personal information may only be accessed by persons within our organization, or our third party service providers, who require such access to carry out the purposes indicated above.
Unfortunately, no security system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information and cannot assume liability for improper access to it. The Internet is not a secure medium and you acknowledge and agree that the privacy of your email communication and personal information can never be guaranteed as any email communication may be lost, intercepted or altered.

Some or all of the personal information we collect may be stored or processed on servers located outside your jurisdiction of residence, including in the United States, whose data protection laws may differ from the jurisdiction in which you live. As a result, this information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in those jurisdictions according to laws in those jurisdictions. Subject to applicable laws in such other jurisdictions, we will use reasonable efforts to ensure that appropriate protections are in place to require the data processor in that country to maintain protections on the personal information.
