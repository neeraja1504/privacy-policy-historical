Grand View Research, Inc. (“us,” “we,” or “Company”) is committed to respecting the privacy rights of its customers, visitors, and other users of the Company Website (the “Site”). We created this Website Privacy Policy (this “Policy”) to give you confidence as you visit and use the Site, and to demonstrate our commitment to fair information practices and the protection of privacy. This Policy is only applicable to the Site, and not to any other websites that you may be able to access from the Site, each of which may have data collection and use practices and policies that differ materially from this Policy.
1.2. NOTICE CONCERNING CHILDREN
PLEASE NOTE: We are a general audience site, and do not direct any of our content specifically at children under 13 years of age. We understand and are committed to respecting the sensitive nature of children’s privacy online. If we learn or have reason to suspect that a Site user is under age 13, we will promptly delete any personal information in that user’s account.
1.3. ABOUT THE GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) takes effect on May 25, 2018 and includes substantial changes to the European Union data protection laws. The purpose is to standardize data protection laws across the EU, enable people in the EU enhanced rights to their data and require businesses to meet technical and organizational controls around the collection and processing of personal data. The Company has made changes in line with these new standards, which changes are set forth below in Section 7.
Please read this statement carefully and contact our Data Protection Officer at legal-eu@grandviewresearch.com if you have any questions about our privacy practices or your personal data choices, and please also feel free to contact your supervisory authority, contact details for which may be found here: http://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm.
