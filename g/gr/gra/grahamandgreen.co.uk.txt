Who we share your data with
Catalogues
Our catalogues are delivered by a mailing house, so we need to share your name and address with them. We have ensured that our chosen mailing house will treat your personal data with as much respect as we do.
When you request our catalogue directly from us, if you give us permission, then we will share your name, address and details of your purchases with data profiling companies Abacus and I-Behavior, who manage prospect pools on behalf of retailers. The participating retailers are active in the clothing, collectables, food & wine, gardening, gadgets & entertainment, health & beauty, household goods, and home interiors categories. The retailers share information on what their customers buy so that other retailers can market to people who may have an interest in their products.
Deliveries
We will share your name, address, email address and phone number with our trusted couriers so that they can make the delivery to you and send delivery updates directly to you. We use different couriers depending on the size of the item(s) you have ordered, how quickly you have requested delivery and where you live, but we will always let you know who will be delivering your order.
Competitions
Sometimes we run competitions with other businesses. When entering a competition, you may choose whether to also receive marketing from them too. We will always be transparent with you about who the third party is, and we will not share your email with them for marketing unless you opt-in for this.
How long we keep your data
We work hard to ensure that we do not keep your personal data for longer than is necessary to fulfil the purpose for which it was collected. Generally, we will not retain your personal data for longer than six years, as this is the statutory period for retaining HMRC records.

We will protect the data you entrust to us with appropriate measures and controls, as well as ensuring that the companies we work with are just as careful with your data.

When we share your details with data profiling companies, they analyse the pooled information from all participating retailers in order to understand consumer’s wider buying patterns. From this information, we can tailor our communications, so that we only send people suitable offers that should be of interest to them, based on what they like to buy. You can update your preferences and request us to stop sharing your information using the preference centre in your Graham and Green account or contacting us at mailorder@grahamandgreen.co.uk.
