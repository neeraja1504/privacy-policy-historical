Collection of Information Using Cookies and Other Tools for Online Advertising
Pivotal may collect and/or log your Internet Protocol address, Internet domain name, the web browser and operating system used to access our websites, the files visited, the time spent in each file, and the time and date of each visit. Pivotal may collect this information automatically as you browse our websites through the use of log files and web beacons. Pivotal may also use cookies to automatically collect information about your use of our websites. Cookies are text files that are sent from a website or application via your browser and placed on your computer's hard drive or your mobile device. Thereafter, when you visit that website or application, a message is sent back to the web server by the browser accessing the website or application, and this information about your activities is stored in the cookie. The information collected in cookies (e.g., the web pages you visit on the website and navigation patterns, the date and time of your visit, the number of links you click within the site, the functions you use on the site, the databases you view and the searches you request on the site, the data you save on, or download from, the site, and the third-party websites you visited immediately before and after visiting the websites, and when you open our e-mails or click on any of their links) may be used and analyzed to improve our service to you and to personalize your web-browsing experience by providing Pivotal with a better understanding of your interests and requirements regarding our websites. Cookies may be linked to your personal information, such as your e-mail address or password. We may also use cookies and other electronic tools placed by a third-party service provider to measure the effectiveness of our advertising and other information and help us understand what product information is of most interest to our customers and what kinds of advertising offers our customers like to see. Although the service provider logs the information coming from our websites on our behalf, Pivotal controls how that data may and may not be used.

Likewise, most mobile devices allow you to disable the ability for geo-location information to be collected from your mobile device. The help function on most browsers and mobile devices contains instructions on how to set your browser to notify you before accepting cookies, disable cookies entirely, or disable the collection of geo-location data. However, disabling cookies in either manner may prevent you from using certain functions and features of websites, and the advertising you receive when you visit the site may not be advertisements tailored to your interests.
With Whom Does Pivotal Share Your Information?
We may disclose information that does not identify any individual (e.g., anonymous, aggregated data) without restriction. Pivotal contracts with third-party service providers, partners and suppliers (including distributors and resellers) to deliver certain products, services, and customer solutions. Examples of such services provided on our behalf are mail delivery, website hosting, transaction processing, and event planning. Pivotal may share your personal information with its service providers and suppliers to the extent necessary to deliver the product or service you requested, respond to your requests for information on products or services, or otherwise support your business needs. You will not have the opportunity to opt out of having your information shared with these third-party service providers and suppliers for these purposes, and they may contact you directly regarding such purposes.
Third-party service providers and suppliers receiving personal information are authorized to use your personal information only for the purpose it was originally intended or as required or permitted by law. However, unless otherwise dictated by law or agreement, Pivotal is not responsible for any improper use by such parties.
We may also disclose your personal information and other information, including across country borders:
to our subsidiaries, affiliates, and worldwide offices,
to comply with the law or in response to a subpoena, court order, law enforcement or government request, or other legal process,
to produce relevant documents or information in connection with litigation, arbitration, mediation, adjudication, government or internal investigations, or other legal or administrative proceedings,
if Pivotal determines in its good faith judgment that such disclosure is necessary to provide its services or to protect the rights, interests, safety, or property of its business, employees, suppliers, customers, or others,
in connection with any proposed or actual sale or other transfer of some or all assets of Pivotal, and/or any proposed or actual sale or merger of Pivotal or any division of Pivotal,
to enforce the terms of any agreement with Pivotal,
to combat fraud or other criminal activity,
for any other purpose disclosed by us when you provide the information,
as otherwise required or permitted by law, and/or
with your consent.
Some Pivotal websites or services may be co-branded or offered in conjunction with another company. If you register for or use such websites/services, both Pivotal and the other company may receive information collected in conjunction with the co-branded website/services.
Unless permitted by relevant laws, Pivotal will not share, sell, trade, or lease your personal information to or with others except as provided for in this Privacy Statement.

To protect your privacy and security, we will take steps to verify your identity before granting access or making changes to your personal information.

While we will make reasonable efforts to accommodate your request, we also reserve the right to reject such access requests or to impose certain restrictions and requirements on such requests, if required or permitted by applicable law.
Our Retention of Your Information. We will retain your personal information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account, or request that we no longer use your personal information to provide you services, contact us via the applicable information provided below.

Security of Your Personal Information
Pivotal has implemented administrative, technical, and physical measures designed to protect your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, disclosure, use, alteration, or destruction. These measures include computer safeguards and secured files and buildings, Internet firewalls, intrusion detection, anti-virus protection, network monitoring, and, where appropriate and required by applicable law, Transport Layer Security (“TLS”) or similarly encrypted browsers. However, no electronic data transmission or storage of information can be guaranteed to be 100% private and secure, and you understand that Pivotal does not ensure or warrant the privacy or security of any information we collect from or about you, and that you use the Pivotal websites and other Pivotal services and provide us with information at your own risk. If a password is used to help protect your accounts and personal information, it is your responsibility to keep your password confidential.

Pivotal will never request your personal information through e-mail.
