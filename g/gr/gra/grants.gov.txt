All information is gathered, stored, and used in accordance with the above-mentioned Privacy Act.
Our privacy and security policy is clear: We will collect no personal information about you when you visit our website unless you choose to provide that information to us.
Information Collected and Stored Automatically
Grants.gov does not require a user to submit information to browse the Grants.gov site. The only users who are required to submit contact information are those users who wish to be authorized submitters on behalf of their organization, or users who wish to receive information directly from Grants.gov.
Grants.gov collects personal information about you (e.g., name, email address, phone number, title, username) only if you specifically and knowingly give it to us. If you consent to provide us with personal information (by providing feedback or by asking a question), we use that information to respond to your message and to help us get you the information you have requested. We only share the information you give us with other government agencies if your inquiry relates to that agency, or as otherwise required by law. Moreover, we do not create individual profiles with the information you provide or give it to any private organizations. We do not collect information for commercial marketing.
Grants.gov collects information to allow access for three types of users:
