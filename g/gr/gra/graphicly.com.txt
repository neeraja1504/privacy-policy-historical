Privacy Policy and Your Privacy Rights
Effective Date: April 19, 2010
Graphicly, Inc. (“ Graphicly ,” “ we ,” or “ us ”) cares about how your personal information is used and shared. We have prepared this Privacy Policy to describe to you our practices regarding the Personal Data (as defined below) we collect from users of our service provided through our website or other communications platforms, including applications on your mobile device (the “ Service ”).
By submitting Personal Data through the Service and using the Service, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and you expressly consent to the processing of your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Your Personal Data may be processed in the country where it was collected and in other countries, including the United States, where laws regarding processing of Personal Data may be less stringent than the laws in your country.
Types of Data We Collect
We collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data from you when you visit our website or use our Service, when you send us information or communications, and/or when you submit content or enter into transactions in connection with our Service. “ Personal Data ” means data that allows someone to identify or contact you, including, for example, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, as well as any other non-public information about you that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing data. “ Anonymous Data ” means data that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Data; Anonymous Data does not permit the identification of individual persons. We collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data, as described below.
Data You Provide to Us. We receive and store any information you enter on our Service or otherwise provide to us, including information that is generated by your activities on our Service.
We collect Personal Data from you, such as your user name, password, age, and e-mail address, when you create an account on our Service or install our application on your computer or device.
When you pay for products or services provided by us, we will collect all information necessary to complete the transaction, including your email address, name, contact information, credit card information or other payment information, and billing information.
We may also collect Personal Data, such as demographic information, from you via the Service or at other points in our website or an application on your mobile device that state that Personal Data is being collected.
If you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail, we may collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the e-mail or that you submit to us, in order to send you a reply.
You may elect to contribute content to the Service, including forum postings, blog entries, in-panel comments, artwork comments, and other content that you own or have the right to display and reproduce. Contributed content will be stored on our servers and other users of the Service will be able to see it.
Data Collected via Technology.
We collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data from you based on your use of the Service, directly and indirectly. Like most Internet services, we automatically gather this Personal Data and Anonymous Data and store it in log files each time you visit our website or access your account through our Service, including through applications on your mobile device.
Our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) collect Anonymous Data from you, such as browser type and version, operating system, platform, Internet Protocol (IP) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, a date/time stamp for your visit, and other demographic information.
We use cookies and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather Anonymous Data such as the date and time of your visit, the information for which you searched and which you viewed, and the sites you visited before and after visiting our website. We also use cookies to collect, store and sometimes track Anonymous Data for statistical purposes to improve the Service. We also use a cookie to save your settings and to provide customizable and personalized services (such as to hold your shopping cart information). A “cookie” is a small data file that can be placed on your hard drive when you visit certain websites. Additionally, be aware that if you visit other websites you may be required to accept cookies. Advertisers and partners may also use their own cookies. We do not control use of these cookies used by advertisers and partners and expressly disclaim responsibility for information collected through them.
We use software tools such as Flash or JavaScript to collect page interaction information on our website such as clicks, drags, and hover-overs, response times, errors, and length of visits to certain pages.
We may use clear gifs or other data files or identifiers to track Anonymous Data for statistical purposes to improve and develop the services we provide. Additionally, be aware that advertisers and partners may also use their own clear gifs and we do not control use of these by advertisers and partners and expressly disclaim responsibility for information collected through them. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are placed on a user’s hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages.
