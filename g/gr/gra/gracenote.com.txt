Additional details about the information we may gather about you can be found below.
When you register or create an account on this Website, submit a question or request (e.g., to learn more about our data and services), sign up for an event that we are hosting, or provide us with feedback, we will collect the information that you voluntarily provide, such as your name, email address, phone number, employment details, and geographical location.
This Website may host various blogs, message boards, forums, or other services (including social media services) that allow you to share information and content with other visitors.

You should keep this in mind when sharing any personal information or other information on this Website.
As is true of most websites, when you visit and browse this Website, we also gather certain information automatically, including log usage data (e.g., when you view or click on content) and information from your device and network, including your IP address, browser operating system and version, device identifier and features, access times, and referring website addresses.
We may use cookies (i.e., small text files placed on your device) and similar technologies (e.g., web beacons, pixels, and ad tags) to enable certain features and functionality and collect additional information that helps us to improve this Website and better deliver our services to you. In particular, we may use cookies (session cookies and persistent cookies) to identify your browser or device, display information more effectively, provide you with tailored content, and gather statistical information about how you use this Website. We may also use such technologies for security purposes and to detect and defend against fraud and other risks in order to protect this Website’s visitors. If you do not wish to have information collected from your device by cookies, most browsers allow you to control and decline the use of cookies through the browser settings. Please note, however, that if you decline the use of cookies or limit the ability of this Website to set cookies, some of its features may not work properly.

We generally do not seek sensitive personal information (e.g., information relating to an individual’s racial or ethnic origin, political opinions or other similar beliefs, health or medical conditions, criminal background, or trade union membership) about visitors to this Website. If you voluntarily provide sensitive personal information for any reason or we are required to collect such information as a result of legal requirements imposed on us, we will, where necessary, obtain your explicit consent and use such information in accordance with this Privacy Statement and applicable law.
Use of Your Information
We use your information for the purpose(s) for which it was collected or provided to us (as stated at the point of collection) or as otherwise obvious from the context of collection. We may also use your information to:
administer and manage this Website, communicate with you about this Website, and respond to your inquiries and requests;

After you unsubscribe, we will not send you further promotional materials or communications, but we may continue to contact you to the extent necessary for the purposes of any services you have requested.
Legal Basis for the Processing of Your Personal Information
Applicable law in your country of residence may require us to set out in this Privacy Statement the legal basis upon which we rely in order to process your personal information.
If you are based in the European Union (“ EU ”)/European Economic Area (“ EEA ”), we will process your personal information for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Statement based on: (a) the consent that you provide us at the point of collection of your personal information to use such information for certain specific purposes; or (b) our legitimate interests, provided that such interests are not overridden by your interests, fundamental rights, or freedoms. In particular, we may process your personal information in reliance on a legitimate interest in the effective and lawful operation of this Website and our businesses as well as the effective delivery of information and services to you. We may have other legitimate interests and, if so, we will make clear what those interests are at the relevant point in time. To the extent that we process any sensitive personal information relating to you, we will do so because either: (a) you have given us your explicit consent to process the information; (b) the processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims; or (c) you have made the information manifestly public.
If you have any questions or concerns about the legal basis upon which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us at privacy.department@nielsen.com.

other third parties as we believe necessary or appropriate for legal purposes.
All of these disclosures may result in the transfer of your information to countries or regions with data protection laws that differ from those in your country of residence. By providing us with your information and using this Website, you are acknowledging that your information may be transferred to countries outside of your country of residence.
