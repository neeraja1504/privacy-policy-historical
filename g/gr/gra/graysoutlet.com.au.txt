Personal information that we collect and how.
The personal information we collect from you and hold includes information that is necessary in order for us to offer goods or services to you and to delivery these goods and services. This includes your Name, Address, Telephone Number and E-mail address.
We collect personal information directly from you and very occasionally via 3rd Party Suppliers. In other instances, we may collect personal information directly from you when you contact us (for example, when you make a telephone enquiry) and when you use our Web Site or use our mobile Apps.
Personal information is also collected directly from you via a series of forms which you complete including:
a) Membership Registration
Our site's registration form requires you to provide us contact information (email address) and may occasionally require demographic information. At this time you may withhold certain information if you so wish such as your real name and act under a pseudonym. We do not require any other personal information at this stage.
b) Passwords
You are responsible for all actions taken with your user name, email address and password. Therefore we do not recommend that you disclose your OO password to any third parties. If you choose to share your user name, email address and password or your information with third parties to provide you additional services, you are responsible for all actions taken with this information and therefore you should review that third party's privacy policy.
c) Address and telephone number
When you place an order on our website or via our mobile Apps we will require you to insert your address and telephone number and any other information relevant to your order, including your payment information and information on your payment method. At this time we may require you to provide us with your full name and not rely on any pseudonym you may have used to access the website. We will require your full postal address and in some circumstances we are unable to rely on or delivery to a P.O. Box. We also require your telephone number in order to contact you regarding the order or service that you have purchased or for other reasons.
Personal information that we collect via a 3rd party and how.
Personal information that we collect via a 3rd Party is information that you have opted in to share with us.

This basic information includes your name, e-mail address, gender and date of birth.
We may require further personal information and will prompt you to supply us with that information such as your address and contact details when you place an order as detailed above.
How we hold your personal information.

Cookies
Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored in a browser-related file on your computer's hard drive when you use our Web site. We use cookies to improve the member experience. We also use them to deliver information and fresh content specific to your interests. Cookies are widely used on most major Web sites.
OO mostly uses "session" cookies, which are removed from your computer once you leave OO. These are used so our service can remember that you have logged in already and prevent you doing so more frequently. The technology we use (Microsoft .NET), requires the use of session cookies. Session cookies expire and are deleted after 30 minutes of no activity on OO.
OO also uses persistent cookies to personalise the user experience, to help protect our members and to provide us with research information (such as how often members visit OO each month). Persistent cookies allow us to track users on OO and help us identify users abusing the OO service.
