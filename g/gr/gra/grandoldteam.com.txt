Editorial Policy
While we welcome all forms of contribution, we appreciate well-structured, informative, and interestingly written pieces dealing exclusively with Everton. The decision to publish, and the degree of editorial control exercised by GrandOldTeam.com, will be at our discretion. However, we do request that you read and abide by our Terms and Conditions of Use. GrandOldTeam assumes an open-door policy with regard to submissions and contributions. This website is provided by fans for the fans which means that we provide a forum for you to air your views, whether we agree with them or not. We always welcome reader responses that challenge any viewpoints espoused in the articles we publish and often we will counter such pieces with arguments of our own. Our line-up of columnists and contrbutors aims to provide a wide spectrum of viewpoints but, as is of often the case, it is critical content that gets seized upon as evidence of perceived or inherent bias. Please note: Just because we publish an article does not necessarily mean we agree with the views of the author. All materials published on GrandOldTeam may be subject to editorial review. This usually comprises minor text editing and formatting for web layout, page presentation, and readability. Spelling, grammar, and other errors may be corrected during this process. Content will rarely be changed as part of the editorial process, unless the meaning is unclear or obscure, statements made expose us to liability, or where the content is either abusive or similarly deemed unacceptable conduct. We may add links to other websites or to other pages on GrandOldTeam, as we deem appropriate.
