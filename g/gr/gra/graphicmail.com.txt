Communications to Users
Unless we are prohibited by applicable law from using cookies and a user has not otherwise consented to our use of cookies, we insert cookies in some of our correspondence with users.
In that case, when we send an email message to a user, our message contains images or links, which when viewed or clicked, will register an event with us that allows us to know whether the user has accessed or declined to open our message. This action may also store a cookie which will allow us to count unique clicks or visits and potentially track the recipient.
This information is needed for our legitimate business purposes, because it helps us understand how the individual reacts to our communications and limit the amount and nature of information provided. We believe that such means are fair, lawful, and proportional to the legitimate interest and needs of our business, and that our methodology fairly addresses each user’s legitimate rights and expectations in view of the context and purpose for the collection and use of the information collected.
The information is collected in connection with our marketing efforts and is retained so that we can continue or elect to stop interaction with the lead.
We do not want to intrude in your busy life or waste your time.

Surveys and Contests
From time-to-time, we invite users to participate in surveys or contests. Participation is voluntary. These surveys are organized for the purposes of our marketing efforts.
When a user participates, we request certain personal data such as name and email address. This is necessary to ensure that responses are categorized properly and are not duplicated
Depending on the nature of the survey or contents, we also use this information to send the survey results to the participants, or, if applicable, to notify contest winners and award prizes.
We use the information obtained from these surveys and contests in aggregate form, for analytics purposes, to understand our market, to monitor site traffic or app usage, or to modify our Platform or our Service to meet the needs or interests of users.
If we use a third-party service provider to conduct these surveys, the information collected by the service provider may be subject to both the service provider’s privacy policy and SharpSpring’s. We will provide information about the applicable privacy policies with the Survey rules and will seek your explicit consent to these rules when required by law. You should read the terms of the survey or contest to understand the extent to which the service provider is allowed to use or reuse the information collected.

Our Platform offers integrations with third-party social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. These services collect your IP address and which page you are visiting on our Platform. They may set a cookie to enable their features to function properly. Social media features and widgets are hosted by a third party or directly on our website. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing the feature.
_ _Your use of these services is optional. If you elect to use them, you will be deemed to have expressly consented to the collection of personal data by these services according to their terms.__
Information we Obtain from Third Parties
We receive information from third party data providers including directories. In some cases, such as LinkedIn, the information has manifestly been made public by the individuals who posted their profile on LinkedIn, and we assume that the individuals no longer have a privacy interest in such information, and it can be used for the legitimate interest of SharpSpring in learning about potential Customers.
In other cases, where it is not clear that the information was made manifestly public by the individuals, we obtain this data with assurances from these providers that the user has consented to the collection and sharing of this data, or that this information is available in public records and that is permissible to collect.
We receive information from social media services that you have elected to use to access our site or apps, in accordance with the social media services’ privacy policy.

In the event that we become aware of a security breach which we believe has resulted, or may result, in the unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of non-public personal information of users, we will promptly investigate the matter and notify the applicable parties of such breach. Such investigation will be without delay, consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement; (ii) measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach; (iii) efforts to identify the individuals affected; and (iv) steps to restore the reasonable integrity of our Platform.
If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us might have been compromised), or if you suspect someone else is using your account, please let us know immediately by contacting us as indicated in the “How to Contact Us” section.
Lost or Stolen Information
You must promptly notify us if your credit, bank, other financial institution information, username, or password is lost, stolen, or used without permission. In such an event, we will assist you in updating your account details.
We will retain personal data we collect from you where we have justifiable business need to do so, and/or for as long as it is needed to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required by law, such as for tax, legal, or accounting purposes.
You can request deletion of your personal data at any time, and we will consider your request in accordance with applicable laws.
When we have no justifiable business need to process your personal data, we will either delete it or anonymize it, or if it not possible (for example, because your personal data has been stored in backup archives), we will securely store your personal data and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

We may seek to rely on your consent in order to process certain personal data. Where we do so, you have the right not to provide your consent, and the right to withdraw your consent at any time.

17. California Residents: Rights under California Law
California requires operators of websites or similar services to make certain disclosures to users who reside in California regarding their rights, specifically:
Shine the Light
Under California law, a business that has an established business relationship with an individual, and has, within the immediately preceding calendar year, disclosed personal data that is primarily used for personal, family or household purposes to third party for the third party’s direct marketing purposes, must disclose to its California users, upon request, the identity of any such third party, along with the type of personal data disclosed.
You can contact us to as provided in the “How to Contact Us” section. Please note that under California law, businesses are only required to respond to a user’s request once during any calendar year.
Do-Not-Track
Some browsers give individuals the ability to communicate that they wish not to be tracked while browsing on the Internet. California law requires that we disclose to users how we treat do-not-track requests. The Internet industry has not yet agreed on a definition of what “Do Not Track” means, how compliance with “Do Not Track” would be measured or evaluated, or a common approach to responding to a “Do Not Track” signal. Due to the lack of guidance, we have not yet developed features that would recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track signals in response to California law.
In the meantime, there are technical means to prevent some of the tracking, if any. See Section “Your Advertising Choices.”
Our Platform is not directed to individuals under the age of 18. We do not solicit or knowingly collect Personal data from such individuals. If you become aware that a child has provided us with personal data, please contact us as indicated in the “How to Contact Us” section below. If we obtain actual knowledge that we have collected Personal data from a child under the age of 18, we will take steps to delete such information from our database.
