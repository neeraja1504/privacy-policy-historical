Privacy Policy
Your privacy is very important to us. GLStock ("Administrator") adheres to the following privacy policy
regarding its collection, use and dissemination of personal and non-personal information collected through its website ("Site").
Collection of Non-Personal Information
Whenever you visit a web page on the internet, your browser automatically identifies the IP address from where your page request was initiated – i.e. your computer. It also volunteers certain basic information like browser type, the operating system you are running, and in some cases the page which referred to the Site (if you clicked a link from another website). The Administrator's server automatically collects this information and tracks it on a page by page and on a statistical basis.
Use of Non-Personal Information
The Administrator uses non-personal information such as the region or country your IP request came from to suggest the appropriate language to use or to select the best presentation aligned to that region of the world. We also use browser type, operating system, and page visits for statistical analysis of site usage and navigation trends.
Collection of Personal Information
When you sign up as an Adopter or Promoter under the relevant agreement, we may ask for your name, your e-mail address, and contact information. The Administrator also uses "Cookies" to collect information about our visitors.
