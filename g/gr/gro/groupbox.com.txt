Privacy policy
Groupbox Principles
We built the Groupbox website to make it easy to keep up to date with your friends. We encourage you to use Groupbox to share your personal information - with that, we know that you don't want all of your personal information shared with the wider world.Â  That is why we give you control of your information. Our default privacy settings limit the information displayed in your profile to your friends (those people you have nominated to be your friends).
Groupbox follows three core principles:
1. You should have control over your personal information.
Groupbox helps you share information with your friends and people around you. You choose what information you put in your profile, including contact and personal information, pictures, interests and groups you join. And you control with whom you share that information through the privacy settings on your profile and settings pages.
2. You should have access to the information others want to share.
There is an ever increasing world of information on the Internet and Groupbox allows you to easily view that which is relevant to you.
3. You should be protected from those that do not wish to follow the rules. Groupbox runs on the input of users and thus we value that input above anything else.
Sharing information should be easy. And we want to provide you with the privacy tools necessary to control how and with whom you share that information. If you have questions or ideas, please contact Groupbox
