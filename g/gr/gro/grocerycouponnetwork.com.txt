HOW DO WE PROTECT PERSONAL INFORMATION?
We have security measures in place designed to protect the security of Your information. All collected information is stored in a technically and physically secure environment. In addition when You submit Your credit card information or other sensitive information, the 128-bit encrypted Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") connection scrambles or encrypts Your information before it is sent to Us over the Internet. This protects Your credit card information from being read while it is transferred. SSL is supported by Netscape 2.0+, Microsoft IE 3.0+ and most frame-enabled browsers. Depending on which browser You use, You will know that You are in a secure area by "https" or a small key or padlock in the bottom right hand corner of Your browser indicating that Your transaction is secure. Unfortunately, no security measures can ever be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect Your Personal Information and sensitive information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that You transmit to us, and You do so at Your own risk. Once we receive Your transmission, we make reasonable efforts to ensure its security on our systems. Access to Personal Information is strictly limited, and not accessible to the public. All Personal Information is restricted in our offices. Only employees that need the Personal Information to perform a specific job (for example, a customer service representative) are granted access to Personal Information. Our employees are dedicated to ensuring the security and privacy of all Personal Information. Employees not adhering to our firm policies are subject to disciplinary action. In compliance with applicable federal and state laws, we shall notify You and any applicable regulatory agencies in the event that we learn of an information security breach with respect to Your Personal Information. You will be notified via e-mail in the event of such a breach. Please be advised that notice may be delayed in order to address the needs of law enforcement, determine the scope of network damage, and to engage in remedial measures.
Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our website, or as required by law.
DO THESE SAME PRIVACY POLICIES APPLY TO THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES THAT YOU ACCESS THROUGH THE GROCERY COUPON NETWORK WEBSITE?
No. This Privacy Policy only applies to our Sites and our collection and use of your information. Any linked third party websites from Affiliates, products and services, and their collection and use of your information, are governed by the privacy policies of such third parties. We encourage you to learn about the privacy policies and practices of those third parties in connection with your use of those sites. You will notice that the Website may contain links to other websites, such as websites operated by Our Sponsors. We cannot be responsible for, and shall have no liability in connection with, the privacy and security practices of other websites that You may access through the Website, even if links to those third party websites are displayed within a frame on Our Website.

A SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING PEOPLE UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN (18)
Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important.

If you are under 13 years of age, then please do not use or access the Sites at any time or in any manner. If we learn that personally identifiable information of persons under 13 years of age has been collected on the Sites without verified parental consent, then we will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.
Our intention is to fully comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"). Qples encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and to participate and monitor the interactive activities of their children. If a parent or guardian has knowledge or is made aware of the fact that a child under the age of eighteen (18) has provided Us with Personal Information through the Website or otherwise, Contact Us and We will delete the information about the child from Our database.

Qples does not under any circumstances send or support in any way the generation of unsolicited messages to any person's computer, fax machine or email address.
Qples is a service that publishes and distributes coupons. Companies retain Qples to assist them with the distribution of their available coupon inventory.
We do not send spam and we do not distribute unwanted messages to the general public. Our Website allows for visitors to register and receive online notification when coupons are available, but this service is entirely voluntary and you would only be receiving these emails if you proactively subscribed to the service. Further, all emails sent to registrants include "unsubscribe" instructions at the bottom of the each email. If you received an unsolicited email that includes a coupon that we distributed (as evident by the word "(Grocery Coupon Network)" within the dateline of the release), you are not being spammed by Grocery Coupon Network but rather by someone else. Grocery Coupon Network delivers its subscribers coupons to websites and portals where the information is easily accessed by the public, including spammers who violate our copyrights by illegally copying these coupons and including it in their spam to you.
What you can do
Unsolicited Faxes
Grocery Coupon Network does not send unsolicited faxes. If you received an unsolicited fax that includes the word "(Grocery Coupon Network)" within the document, it is because the spammer is illegally copying & pasting a legitimate coupon that we distributed for a client and included it in their fax to you.
Email SPAM
Grocery Coupon Network does not send email spam. If you received an unsolicited email that includes the word "(Grocery Coupon Network)" within the documents, it is because the spammer is illegally copying & pasting a legitimate coupon that we distributed and included it in their email to you.
Report it to the Federal Trade Commission
Send a copy of unwanted or deceptive messages to uce@ftc.gov. The FTC uses the unsolicited emails stored in this database to pursue law enforcement actions against people who send deceptive spam email. Let the FTC know if a "remove me" request is not honored. If you want to complain about a removal link that doesn't work or not being able to unsubscribe from a list, you can fill out the FTC's online complaint form. Your complaint will be added to the FTC's Consumer Sentinel database and made available to hundreds of law enforcement and consumer protection agencies. Whenever you complain about spam, it's important to include the full email header. The information in the header makes it possible for consumer protection agencies to follow up on your complaint.
Send a copy of the spam to your ISP's abuse desk
Often the email address is abuse@yourispname.com or postmaster@yourispname.com. By doing this, you can let the ISP know about the spam problem on their system and help them to stop it in the future. Make sure to include a copy of the spam, along with the full email header. At the top of the message, state that you're complaining about being spammed.
Complain to the sender's ISP
Most ISPs want to cut off spammers who abuse their system. Again, make sure to include a copy of the message and header information and state that you're complaining about spam.
