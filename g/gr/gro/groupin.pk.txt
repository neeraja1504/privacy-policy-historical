Privacy Policy
This Groupin.pk privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") is proposed to inform you of our policies regarding the collection, use and leak of any information you submit to us through Groupin.pk. This includes "Personal Information," which is your personal information such as your name, e-mail address, user ID number, and other non-public information that is associated with the foregoing, as well as "Anonymous Information," which is information that is not related or linked to your Personal Information and does not permit the identification of individual persons.
By accessing or otherwise using Groupin.pk, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, which is integrated into and forms a part of the Groupin.pk terms of service (set forth on Groupin.pk terms). You expressly consent to the processing of your Personal Information and Anonymous Information according to this Privacy Policy. Your Personal Information may be processed and stored in other countries (including the United States) where laws regarding processing of Personal Information may be less rigid than the laws in your country. Your Personal Information will not, however, be used or disclosed for purposes for which you have not given consent or which are not allowed under applicable law.
Children under the age of 13 are not permitted to use Groupin.pk and we do not intentionally collect or maintain Personal Information from those who are under 13 years old. Protecting the privacy of children is very important to us. Thus, if we obtain actual knowledge that a user is under 13, we will take steps to remove that user's Personal Information permanently from our databases. We recommend that children between the ages of 13 and 18 obtain their parent's permission before submitting information over the internet. By using Groupin.pk, you are representing that you are at least 18 years old, or that you are at least 13 years old and have a parent's or guardian's permission to use Groupin.pk.

If you choose to sign up to receive information about products or services that may be of interest to you, we will collect your email address and other related information. Additionally, we collect any information that you voluntarily enter, including Personal Information, into any postings, comments, or forums within the Groupin.pk community.
We may receive Personal Information about you from other sources with which you have registered or through Companies who we have partnered with (collectively, "Partners"). We may associate this information with the other Personal Information we have collected about you.
If you send an email to us, we will collect your email address and the full content of your email, including attached files and other information you provide. We may use and display your full name and email address when you send an email notification to a friend through Groupin.pk or the social network from which you have connected to Groupin.pk.

We may also enable advertisers and ad servers to promote third-party products and/or services by placing advertisements on Groupin.pk. These advertisers and ad servers may use Cookies and/or "Web Beacons" (which are usually small, transparent graphic images) in order to monitor information related to served advertisements. Clicking on such advertisements will direct you to the website of a third-party and the advertiser. This Privacy Policy does not cover the privacy practices of any advertisers or ad servers.

You acknowledge that such transfers may occur and are permitted by this Privacy Policy, and that any acquirer of ours or that acquirer's assets may continue to process your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. We may disclose your Personal Information if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on us; or (b) to protect and defend our rights or property, you, or third parties. You hereby consent to us sharing your Personal Information under the circumstances described herein.

Collection
You can browse our sites without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. Once you give us your personal information, you are not anonymous to us. If you choose to provide us with personal information, you consent to the transfer and storage of that information.
We may collect and store the following personal information:
financial information, such as credit card or bank account numbers.
transactional information based on your activities on the sites (such as bidding, buying, selling, item and content you generate or that relates to your account)
shipping, billing and other information you provide to purchase or ship an item
additional information we ask you to submit to authenticate yourself or if we believe you are violating site policies (for example, we may ask you to send us an ID or bill to verify your address, or to answer additional questions online to help verify your identity or ownership of an item you list)
information from other companies, such as demographic and navigation data; and
other supplemental information from third parties (for example, if you incur a debt to us, we will generally conduct a credit check by obtaining additional information about you from a credit bureau, as permitted by law; or if the information you provide cannot be verified, we may ask you to send us additional information, such as your driver's licence, credit card statement, or a recent utility bill or other information confirming your address, or to answer additional questions online to help verify your information).
Use
Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient, and customised experience. You agree that we may use your personal information to:
provide the services and customer support you request;
resolve disputes, collect fees, and troubleshoot problems;
prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities, and enforce our User Agreement;
customise, measure and improve our services, content and advertising;
tell you about our services and those of our corporate family, targeted marketing, service updates, and promotional offers based on your communication preferences; and
compare information for accuracy, and verify it with third parties.
Accessing, Reviewing and Changing Your Personal Information
You can see, review and change most of your personal information by signing on to GROUPIN.PK. Generally, we will not manually modify your personal information because it is very difficult to verify your identity remotely. You must promptly update your personal information if it changes or is inaccurate. Once you make a public posting, you may not be able to change or remove it. Upon your request to Customer Service, we will close your account and remove your personal information from view as soon as reasonably possible, based on your account activity and in accordance with applicable law. We do retain personal information from closed accounts to comply with law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our TERMS AND CONDITIONS AGREEMENT, and take other actions otherwise permitted by law.
Our Disclosure of Your Information
We may disclose your personal information to:
our companies, subsidiaries and other companies within GROUPIN.PK to help detect and prevent potentially illegal acts;
service providers under contract who provide elements of our services, provide separate services that are complimentary to your use of the Site or otherwise help with our business operations (such as fraud investigations, bill collection, affiliate and rewards programmes and marketing activities);
law enforcement agencies, other governmental agencies or third parties in response to a request for information relating to a criminal investigation, alleged illegal activity or any other activity that may expose us, you or any other GROUPIN.PK user to legal liability. The personal information we disclose may include your User ID and User ID history, name, city, county, telephone number, email address, fraud complaints and bidding and listing history or anything else that we deem relevant;
