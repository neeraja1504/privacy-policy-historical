From time to time, GetResponse may contact you via email to notify you of changes to its Service, scheduled maintenance, information about GetResponse and promotional material from GetResponse. The Customer is obliged to update the data provided in the registration form as soon as any change in these data has occurred. We will retain your information for as long as needed to provide you the Service. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
Provision of personal data in connection with your use of the Service is voluntary. Note, however, that the refusal to provide certain data may make it impossible for you to use all or part of the Service functionalities.
Outsourcing of Subscribers Personal Data Processing
GetResponse recognizes the importance of respecting the privacy of Subscribers who decided to entrust their sensitive information with you. We make every effort to safeguard their security. GetResponse will never use the information about the Subscribers you collect within our Service to send any information other than expressly provided by you, nor will we share it with or sell it to anyone else for such use.
Subscribers personal data processing may be outsourced by the Customer to GetResponse only where the Customer is the data controller (within the meaning of Article 7 item 4 of the Act) or where the latter processes such personal data on the basis of Article 31 of the Act.
GetResponse may process Subscribers data within its capacity of data processor as set out in Article 31 of the Act.
Subscribers data processing may be outsourced as regards email address and other Subscriber-related information considered by the Customer necessary to ensure proper provision of the Service.
Further passing of the job of data processing may take place only within the limits, and for the purpose of proper provision, of the Service.
As for the countries from outside of the European Economic Area, GetResponse shall cooperate only with entities from countries which ensure an adequate level of personal data protection.

In certain situations, GetResponse may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
We use other third parties in a scope necessary to provide the Service, such as a credit card processing company to bill the Customer for goods and services. When you sign up for the Service we will share your information as necessary for the third party to provide the Service.
These third parties are prohibited from using your personal information for promotional purposes.

GetResponse has designed internal security processes that encrypt Customer's password to protect it from being divulged or accessed by anyone other than you. Neither GetResponse employees nor any of its contractors can obtain or access your password.

Mailing Policy
When you send us an email, we use your email address to thank you for your comment and/or reply to your question, and we will store your communication and our reply for any future correspondence. Beyond our initial reply, we will never use your email address to send you any unsolicited message or information, nor will we share it with or sell it to anyone else for such use.
When you accept to receive information about our services, promotions, newsletters, press releases, and/or new offers, we use your email address and any other information you give us to provide you with the information or other services, until you ask us to stop (using the 'unsubscribe' instructions provided with each email communication).

Information Security
We believe that keeping personal information secure is one of our most significant responsibilities.
We restrict access to personal information about you to those employees and others who need to know that information to assist us in our business, or to provide products or services to you. We safeguard personal information, according to the established security standards and procedures, by maintaining physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to the personal data information.
When we request Customers to enter sensitive information, such as credit card number, it is encrypted and protected with the best encryption software in the industry SSL and processed through a reputable payment processor. While on the secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon at the bottom of web browsers, e.g. Mozilla Firefox or Microsoft Internet Explorer, becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked or open, when you are just 'surfing'.
All of our Customers' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (e.g. our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are personally granted access to sensitive information.
