Cookies and right to object in direct mail
“Cookies” are small files that are stored on users’ computers. Different information can be stored within the cookies. A cookie is primarily used to store the information about a user (or the device on which the cookie is stored) during or after his visit to an online offer. Temporary cookies, or “session cookies” or “transient cookies”, are cookies that are deleted after a user leaves an online service and closes his browser. In such a cookie, e.g. the contents of a shopping cart are stored in an online store or a login jam. The term “permanent” or “persistent” refers to cookies that remain stored even after the browser has been closed. Thus, e.g. the login status will be saved if users visit it after several days. Likewise, in such a cookie the interests of the users can be stored, which are used for range measurement or marketing purposes. A “third-party cookie” refers to cookies that are offered by providers other than the person who manages the online offer (otherwise, if it is only their cookies, this is called “first-party cookies”).
We can use temporary and permanent cookies and clarify this in the context of this privacy policy.
We strive to provide you with the most personalized and user-friendly service possible. For this, and in order to make website improvements, we collect and store information about how you use our offer. We use cookies, small text files that your browser stores on your computer or mobile phone.
A cookie itself does not contain or collect any personal information about you or your internet usage. However, they are important, for example, for analyzing the behavior of guests on our website, or for showing personalized offers or for registering registered users for the duration of their visit. Cookies allow the website to “remember” you either for the duration of your current visit (“session cookie”) or for multiple visits (“persistent cookie”). First and foremost, they should allow you to use our website more efficiently and activate certain functions on the website.
How can you control the receipt of cookies?
Most web browsers accept cookies automatically. You can prevent cookies from being stored on your computer or mobile phone by setting your browser to not accept cookies. For detailed instructions on how to change your cookie settings, see the “Help” section of your browser. You can also at any time delete the cookies that are already stored on your device. Helpful information can be found on the information page allaboutcookies.org.
If you decide to generally not accept cookies, you can of course visit our website anyway. However, it may happen that you will not be able to use all the features and services or that certain content we offer will be unavailable.
A general contradiction against the use of the cookies used for the purpose of online marketing can be explained in a variety of services, in particular in the case of tracking, via the US side www.aboutads.info/choices/ or the EU page www.youronlinechoices.com/.
The data processed by us are deleted or limited in their processing in accordance with the Articles 17 and 18 GDPR. Unless explicitly stated in this privacy policy, the data stored by us are deleted as soon as they are no longer required for their purpose and the deletion does not conflict with any statutory storage requirements. Unless the data is deleted because it is required for other and legitimate purposes, its processing will be restricted. That is, the data is blocked and not processed for other purposes. This applies, for example for data that must be kept for commercial or tax reasons.
According to legal requirements in Germany, the storage takes place in particular for 6 years pursuant to § 257 paragraph 1 HGB (trading books, inventories, opening balance sheets, annual accounts, trade letters, accounting documents, etc.) and for 10 years in accordance with § 147 Abs. 1 AO (books, records, Management reports, accounting documents, trade and business letters, documents relevant to taxation, etc.).
Business-related processing
In addition, we process the following data from our customers, prospects and business partners for the purpose of providing contractual services, service and customer care, marketing, advertising and market research:
Contract data (e.g. contract, period of validity, customer category).
Payment data (e.g. bank details, payment history).
The hosting services we use are for the purpose of providing the following services: infrastructure and platform services, computing capacity, storage and database services, security and technical maintenance services we use to operate this online service.
Here we, or our hosting provider, process inventory data, contact data, content data, contract data, usage data, meta and communication data of customers, interested parties and visitors to this online offer on the basis of our legitimate interests in an efficient and secure provision of this online offer acc. Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR in conjunction with Art. 28 GDPR (conclusion of contract processing contract).
Collection of access data and log files
We, or our hosting provider, collect on the basis of our legitimate interests within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f. GDPR data on every access to the server on which this service is located (so-called server log files). The access data includes the name of the retrieved web page, file, date and time of retrieval, amount of data transferred, message about successful retrieval, browser type and version, the user’s operating system, referrer URL (the previously visited page), IP address and the requesting provider.
Logfile information is stored for security purposes (for example, to investigate abusive or fraudulent activities) for a maximum of 7 days and then deleted. Data whose further retention is required for evidential purposes shall be exempted from the cancellation until final clarification of the incident.
Order processing in the online shop and customer account
We process the data of our customers as part of the ordering process in our online shop to allow them to select and order the selected products and services, as well as their payment and delivery, or execution.
The processed data includes inventory data, communication data, contract data, payment data and the persons affected by the processing include our authors, customers, prospects and other business partners. Processing is for the purpose of providing contractual services in the context of the operation of an online shop, billing, delivery and customer service. Here we use session cookies for the storage of the shopping cart contents and permanent cookies for the storage of the login status.
Processing is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b (execution of order transactions) and c (legally required archiving) GDPR. The information marked as required for the establishment and fulfillment of the contract is required. We disclose the data to third parties only in the context of extradition, payment or in the context of legal permissions and obligations to legal advisors and authorities. The data will be processed in third countries only if necessary for the fulfillment of the contract (for example, on customer’s request upon delivery or payment).
Users can optionally create a user account in which they can in particular view their orders. As part of the registration, the necessary mandatory information will be communicated to the users. The user accounts are not public and cannot be indexed by search engines. If users have terminated their user account, their data regarding the user account will be deleted, subject to their retention is necessary for commercial or tax law reasons according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c GDPR.
Information in the customer account remains until its deletion with subsequent archiving in case of a legal obligation. It is the responsibility of the users to secure their data upon termination before the end of the contract.
As part of the registration and re-registration and use of our online services, we store the IP address and the time of the respective user action. The storage is based on our legitimate interests, as well as the user’s protection against misuse and other unauthorized use. A transfer of these data to third parties does not take place, unless it is necessary for the prosecution of our claims or there is a legal obligation in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c GDPR.
The deletion takes place after expiry of legal warranty and comparable obligations, the necessity of keeping the data is checked every three years; in the case of legal archiving obligations, the deletion takes place after its expiration (end of commercial law (6 years) and tax law (10 years) retention obligation).
Payment via PayPal:
If you pay for services with Paypal (PayPal (Europe) S.à.r.l. et Cie, S.C.A., 22-24 Boulevard Royal, L-2449 Luxembourg), data on the purchase will be forwarded to Paypal. The privacy policy of Paypal can be found here: https://www.paypal.com/uk/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full.
Payment via debit or credit card:
For the processing of credit card and direct debit payments, we use the service provider PayOne (BS PAYONE GmbH, Lyoner Strasse 9, 60528 Frankfurt / Main, Germany). PayOne provides an interface for initiating payment transactions and submitting data to the PayOne platform. Payments are made in a separate area (iframes) by PayOne on our website. Our systems are therefore not in direct contact with the buyer’s card data.
The privacy policy of PayOne can be found here: https://www.payone.com/en/privacy/.
For the data processing of the payment processing services, they are “responsible” themselves.
Provision of contractual services
We process inventory data (e.g., names and addresses as well as user and author contact information), contract data (e.g., services used, contact names, billing information) for the purpose of fulfilling our contractual obligations and services in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit b. GDPR. The entries marked as obligatory in online forms are required for the conclusion of the contract.
As part of the use of our online services, we store the IP address and the time of each user action. The storage is based on our legitimate interests, as well as the interests of users against abuse and other unauthorized use. A transfer of these data to third parties does not take place, unless it is necessary for the prosecution of our claims or there is a legal obligation in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c GDPR.
We process usage data (e.g. the visited web pages of our online offering or interest in our products) and content data (e.g. entries in the contact form or user profile) for advertising purposes in a user profile to inform the user e.g. about product instructions based on their previously used services.
The deletion of the data takes place after expiration of legal warranty and comparable obligations, the necessity of the storage of the data is checked every three years; in the case of legal archiving obligations, the deletion takes place after its expiration.

Administration, financial accounting, office organization, contact management
We process data in the context of administrative tasks and organization of our business, financial accounting and compliance with legal obligations, such as archiving. We process the same data that we process in the course of rendering our contractual services. The processing principles are Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c. GDPR, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f. GDPR. The processing affects customers, prospects, business partners and website visitors. The purpose and interest in processing lies in administration, financial accounting, office organization and data archiving, which are tasks that serve to maintain our business, perform our duties and provide our services. The deletion of the data in terms of contractual performance and contractual communication corresponds to the information provided in these processing activities.
We disclose or transmit data to the financial administration, consultants, such as tax accountants or auditors, and other fee agents and payment service providers.
Furthermore, based on our business interests, we store information about suppliers, promoters and other business partners, e.g. for later contact. We generally store this, mostly company-related data permanently.
Business analysis and market research

GDPR, whereby the persons affected include customers, prospects, business partners, visitors and users of the online offer.
The analyses are carried out for the purpose of business analysis, marketing and market research.

The analyses serve to increase the user-friendliness, the optimization of our offer and the business economics. The analyses are for us alone and will not be disclosed externally unless they are anonymous, aggregated value analyses.
If these analyses or profiles are personal, they will be deleted or anonymized upon termination of the users, otherwise after two years from the conclusion of the contract. Incidentally, the overall business analyzes and general trend provisions are created anonymously if possible.
Privacy policy in the application process and Talent Pool
We process the applicant data only for the purpose and in the context of the application process in accordance with all legal requirements. The processing of the applicant data takes place in order to fulfill our (pre-) contractual obligations in the context of the application process within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b. GDPR Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f. GDPR if the data processing e.g. is required for us in the context of legal proceedings (in Germany, § 26 BDSG applies additionally).

Instead of applying via the online form and e-mail, applicants still have the opportunity to send us the application by post.
The data provided by the applicants may be further processed by us in the event of a successful application for employment purposes. Otherwise, if the application for a job offer is not successful, the applicants’ data will be deleted.

VG Word / Scalable Central Measurement Method
We use the “Scalable Central Measurement Method” (SZM) of INFOnline GmbH (INFOnline GmbH, Brühler Str. 9, D-53119 Bonn) for the determination of statistical parameters for determining the copy probability of texts. Anonymous measurements are taken. Alternatively, traffic metering uses a session cookie or signature created from various automatically transmitted information from your browser to recognize computer systems. IP addresses are only processed in anonymous form. The procedure was developed in compliance with data protection. The only goal of the procedure is to determine the copy probability of individual texts. At no time individual users are identified. Your identity always remains protected. You will not receive advertising through the system.
Many of our pages are provided with JavaScript calls, through which we report the access to the “Verwertungsgesellschaft Wort” (VG Wort). We allow our authors to participate in the distributions of the VG Wort, which complies with the legal remuneration for the use of copyrighted works in accordance with Art. § 53 UrhG.
Usage data and metadata of the users are processed here, whereby the IP addresses are being shortened and the measuring methods are pseudonymous. The shortened IP address is stored for a maximum of 60 days. The usage data in connection with a pseudonymous assignment value (“Identifier”) are stored for a maximum of 6 months.
Users are also provided with an opt-out in order to disagree with the collection for the aforementioned purposes: https://optout.ioam.de. Further information can be found in the data protection statement of INFOnline https://www.infonline.de/datenschutz/benutzer.

Insofar as the contents of a newsletter are concretely described, they are authoritative for the consent of the users. Incidentally, our newsletter contains information about our services and us.
Double opt-in and logging: Registration for our newsletter is done in a so-called double-opt-in procedure. That means after registration, you will receive an e-mail asking you to confirm your registration. This confirmation is necessary so that nobody can register with external e-mail addresses.

Newsletter – shipping service provider
The newsletters will be sent by MailChimp, a mail-order service provider of Rocket Science Group, LLC, 675 Ponce De Leon Ave # 5000, Atlanta, GA 30308, USA. The privacy policy of the shipping service provider can be viewed here: https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/. The Rocket Science Group LLC is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement, which provides a guarantee to comply with European data protection standards: https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000TO6hAAG&status=Active.
The shipping service provider is based on our legitimate interests acc. Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR and a contract processing agreement acc. Art. 28 (3) sentence 1 GDPR.
The shipping service provider may use the data of the recipients in pseudonymous form, i.e. without assignment to a user, to optimize or improve their own services, e.g. for the technical optimization of shipping and the presentation of newsletters or for statistical purposes. However, the shipping service provider does not use the data of our newsletter recipients to address them themselves or to pass the data on to third parties.
Newsletter – Success Measurement
The newsletters contain a so-called “web-beacon”, i.e. a pixel-sized file that is retrieved from the server when opening the newsletter from our server, or if we use a shipping service provider whose server is called. This call will initially collect technical information, such as information about the browser and your system, as well as your IP address and time of retrieval.
This information is used to improve the technical performance of services based on their specifications or audience and their reading habits, based on their locations (which can be determined using the IP address) or access times. Statistical surveys also include determining if the newsletters will be opened, when they will be opened and which links will be clicked. For technical reasons, this information can be assigned to the individual newsletter recipients. However, it is neither our goal nor, if used, that of the shipping service provider to observe individual users. The evaluations rather serve us to recognize the reading habits of our users and to adapt our content to them or to send different content according to the interests of our users.

To learn more about how Google uses data when using partners’ websites and apps, visit: https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites?hl=en.
Google will use this information on our behalf to evaluate the use of our online offer by users, to compile reports on the activities within this online offer and to provide us with further services related to the use of this online offer and the internet usage. In this case, pseudonymous usage profiles of the users can be created from the processed data.
Google is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement, which provides a guarantee to comply with European privacy legislation: https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&status=Active.
We only use Google Analytics with activated IP anonymization.

Google Re/Marketing Services
On the basis of our legitimate interests (i.e. interest in the analysis, optimization and economic operation of our online offer within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) lit. GDPR) we use the marketing and remarketing services (“Google Marketing Services “), LLC, 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA, (“Google”).
Google is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement, which provides a guarantee to comply with European privacy legislation (https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&status=Active).
Google Marketing Services allows us to better target advertisements for and on our website so that we only present ads to users that potentially match their interests. If a user e.g. is being shown ads for products he’s been interested in on other websites, this is called remarketing. For these purposes, when Google and our other websites accessing Google Marketing Services are directly accessed by Google, a code will be executed by Google and so-called (re) marketing tags (invisible graphics or code, also called “Web Beacons “) are being incorporated into the website. With their help, the user is provided with an individual cookie, i.e. a small file is saved (instead of cookies, comparable technologies can also be used). The cookies can be set by different domains, including google.com, doubleclick.net, invitemedia.com, admeld.com, googlesyndication.com or googleadservices.com. In this file is noted which web pages the user visited, in what content he is interested and what offers he has clicked, as well as technical information about the browser and operating system, referring web pages, visiting time and other information on the use of the online offer. The IP address of the users is also recorded, whereby in the context of Google Analytics we announce that the IP address is shortened within member states of the European Union or other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area and is only in exceptional cases being transmitted to one Google server in the US and shortened there. The IP address will not be merged with data of the user within other offers from Google. The above information may also be linked by Google with such information from other sources. If the user then visits other websites, ads tailored to him can be displayed according to his interests.
The data of the users are pseudonymously processed in the context of the Google marketing services. I.e. Google stores and processes e.g. not the name or e-mail address of the users, but processes the relevant data cookie-related within pseudonymous user profiles. I.e. from the perspective of Google, the ads are not managed and displayed to a specifically identified person, but to the cookie owner, regardless of who that cookie owner is. This does not apply if a user has explicitly allowed Google to process the data without this pseudonymization. The information collected about users through Google Marketing Services is transmitted to Google and stored on Google’s servers in the United States.
Among the Google marketing services we use is the online advertising program “Google AdWords”. In the case of Google AdWords, each advertiser receives a different “conversion cookie”. Cookies cannot be tracked through AdWords advertisers’ websites. The information collected through the cookie is used to generate conversion statistics for AdWords advertisers who have opted for conversion tracking. Advertisers will see the total number of users who clicked on their ad and were redirected to a conversion tracking tag page. However, they do not receive information that personally identifies users.
We can incorporate third-party ads based on the Google AdSense marketing service. AdSense uses cookies that enable Google and its affiliate sites to serve ads based on users’ visits to this site or other sites on the Internet.
In addition, we may use the “Google Tag Manager” to integrate and manage the Google Analytics and Marketing Services on our website.
For more information about Google’s data usage for marketing, see the overview page: https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads?hl=en, Google’s Privacy Policy is available at https://www.google.com/policies/privacy?hl=en.
If you wish to object the interest-based advertising through Google Marketing Services, you can take advantage of Google’s setting and opt-out options: http://www.google.com/ads/preferences.
Facebook-Pixels, Custom Audiences and Facebook Conversion
Within our online offer the so-called “Facebook pixel” of the social network Facebook, by Facebook Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA, or, if you are located in the EU, Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbor, Dublin 2, Ireland (“Facebook”) is used due to our legitimate interests in the analysis, optimization and economic operation of our online offer and for these purposes.
Facebook is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement, which provides a guarantee to comply with European privacy legislation (https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000GnywAAC&status=Active).
With the help of the Facebook pixel, it is on the one hand possible for Facebook to determine the visitors to our online offer as a target group for the display of advertisements (so-called “Facebook ads”). Accordingly, we use the Facebook Pixel to display the Facebook Ads we operate only to those Facebook users who have shown an interest in our online offer or who show certain features (e.g. interests in certain topics or products which are determined on the basis of visited websites), which we transmit to Facebook (so-called “Custom Audiences”). With the help of the Facebook pixel, we also want to make sure that our Facebook ads are in line with the potential interest of users and are not annoying. With the help of the Facebook pixel we can also understand the effectiveness of the Facebook ads for statistical and market research purposes, in which we see whether users were redirected to our website after clicking on a Facebook ad (so-called “conversion”).
The processing of the data by Facebook is part of Facebook’s data usage policy. Accordingly, general notes on how to display Facebook Ads, in Facebook’s Data Usage Policy: https://www.facebook.com/policy.php. For specific information and details about the Facebook Pixel and how it works, visit the help section of Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/business/help/651294705016616.
You may object to the capture by the Facebook Pixel and use of your data to display Facebook Ads. To set which types of ads you see within Facebook, you can go to the page set up by Facebook and follow the instructions for the usage-based advertising settings: https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads. The settings are platform independent, i.e. they are adopted for all devices, such as desktop computers or mobile devices.
You can also object to the use of cookies for distance measurement and promotional purposes via the deactivation page of the Network Advertising Initiative (http://optout.networkadvertising.org/) and in addition the US website (http://www.aboutads.info/choices) or the European website (http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices/).
Online presence in social media
We maintain online presence within social networks and platforms in order to communicate with customers, prospects and users active there and to inform them about our services. When calling the respective networks and platforms, the terms and conditions and the data processing guidelines apply to their respective operators.
Unless otherwise stated in our Privacy Policy, we process users’ data as long as they communicate with us within social networks and platforms, e.g. write posts on our online presence or send us messages.
Usage Based Advertising - Online Behavioral Advertising (OBA)
Usage Based Advertising - Measurement Procedure SZMnG by INFOnline GmbH
Our web pages use the measurement procedure (“SZMnG”) provided by INFOnline GmbH (https://www.INFOnline.de) to measure statistical parameters relating to the use of our sites. The reason for collecting these user metrics is to statistically measure the number of visits to our websites, the number of visitors and their surfing behaviour using a standardised procedure to allow values to be collected that are comparable across the market.
For all sites that are members of the Informationsgemeinschaft zur Feststellung der Verbreitung von Werbeträgern e.V. [German Audit Bureau of Circulation] (IVW – http://www.ivw.eu) or that participate in online research carried out by the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Online-Forschung e.V. [German Online Research Working Group] (AGOF – http://www.agof.de), the user metrics will be processed further on a regular basis by the AGOF and the Working Group for Media Analysis (agma – http://www.agma-mmc.de) and will be published under the performance indicator “Unique User” as well as by the IVW with the performance indicators “Page Impression” and “Visits”. This reach and statistics can be accessed on their respective web pages.
1. Legal Basis for Processing
The measurement by INFOnline GmbH using the SZMnG measurement procedure is carried out upon legitimate interest, under Art. 6 Para.1 lit. f) of the GDPR.
The purpose of processing personal data is to gain statistics and to create user categories. The statistics are used to understand and substantiate the use of our sites. The user categories form the basis for an interest-oriented alignment of advertising material and advertising measures. A usage measurement which guarantees comparability with competitors in the market is essential for the marketing of this web page. Our legitimate interest stems from the economic usability of our findings that we get from the statistics, user categories and the market value of our web pages, as well as the direct comparison with third-party web pages, which can be determined from the statistics.
In addition, we have a legitimate interest in making the pseudonymised data of INFOnline, AGOF and IVW available for the purposes of market research (AGOF, agma) and for statistical purposes (INFOnline, IVW). Furthermore, we have a legitimate interest in providing INFOnline’s pseudonymised data for the further development and provision of interest-oriented advertising material.
2. Types of Data
INFOnline GmbH collects the following data which, according to EU-GDPR, can be linked to a particular person:
IP address: On the Internet, each device requires a unique address to transmit information: the IP address. Because of how the Internet functions, it is technically necessary for the IP address to be stored, at least for a short period. IP addresses are truncated to 1 byte before any processing. Further processing is only performed on anonymised IP addresses. No IP addresses that have not been truncated are saved or processed.
A randomly generated Client ID: To allow computer systems to be recognised, the further processing uses either a third-party cookie, a first-party cookie, a local storage object or a signature that is compiled from diverse information from your browser that is transmitted automatically. This identification is explicit for a browser, as long as the cookie or local storage object is not deleted. It is possible to measure the data and to subsequently assign it to the respective client identifier by accessing other websites that also use the measuring method (“SZMnG”) of INFOnline GmbH.
The validity of the cookie is restricted to a maximum of 1 year.
3. Data Use
INFOnline GmbH’s measurement process, which is posted on this web page, determines usage data. This is done to collect the performance indicators of page impressions, visits and clients, and to provide additional performance indicators (e.g. qualified clients). In addition, the measured data is used as follows:
Geolocalisation (web page access being linked to the access location) is performed exclusively on the basis of the anonymised IP addresses and only to the geographical level of federal state/region. The collected geographical information cannot, under any circumstances, be used to determine a user’s specific place of residence.
The usage data from a technical client (e.g. from a device’s browser) are amalgamated from all web pages and saved in a database. This information is technically evaluated for age and gender and handed over to the AGOF service providers for further processing. In the course of the AGOF study, random samples for social characteristics are taken for technical evaluation, which are organised into the following categories: Age, Gender, Nationality, Occupation, Marital Status, General Household Information, Household Income, Place of Residence, Internet Use, Online Interests, Place of Use, Type of User.
4. Data Storage Time
The full IP address will not be saved by INFOnline GmbH. The truncated IP address will be saved for a maximum of 60 days. The usage data in connection with the unique identifier is saved for a maximum of 6 months.
5. Data Disclosure
Neither the IP address nor the truncated IP address will be disclosed. The data with client IDs will be disclosed to the following AGOF service providers for the creation of the AGOF study:
Kantar Deutschland GmbH (https://www.tns-infratest.com/)
Ankordata GmbH & Co. KG (http://www.ankordata.de/homepage/)
Interrogare GmbH (https://www.interrogare.de/)

Integration of services and contents of third parties
Based on our legitimate interests (i.e. interest in the analysis, optimization and economic operation of our online offer within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) lit. GDPR), we make use of content or services offered by third-party providers in order to provide their content and services, such as include videos or fonts (collectively referred to as “content”).
This always presupposes that the third-party providers of this content perceive the IP address of the users, since they could not send the content to their browser without the IP address. The IP address is therefore required for the presentation of this content. We endeavor to use only content whose respective providers use the IP address solely for the delivery of the content. Third parties may also use so-called pixel tags (invisible graphics, also referred to as “web beacons”) for statistical or marketing purposes. The “pixel tags” can be used to evaluate information such as visitor traffic on the pages of this website. The pseudonymous information may also be stored in cookies on the user’s device and may include, but is not limited to, technical information about the browser and operating system, referring web pages, visit time, and other information regarding the use of our online offer.
We embed the videos on the YouTube platform of Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. Privacy Policy: https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/, Opt-Out: https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated.
We use the so-called “extended privacy mode” of the provider YouTube to embed videos. At the same time, a cookie is only saved on your computer when the video is played. According to YouTube, however, no personal cookie information is stored for playing embedded videos with enhanced privacy. For more information about YouTube’s official privacy policy, please visit: http://www.youtube.com/t/privacy_at_youtube
If you want to be sure that no data is being saved on YouTube, do not click on the embedded videos.
We include maps from the Google Maps service provided by Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. The processed data may include, in particular, users’ IP addresses and location data, but these are not collected without their consent (usually as part of the settings of their mobile devices). The data can be processed in the USA. Privacy Policy: https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/, Opt-Out: https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated.
Use of Facebook social plugins
Based on our legitimate interests (i.e. interest in the analysis, optimization and economic operation of our online offer within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) f. GDPR) we use social plugins (“plugins”) of the social network facebook.com, which is operated by Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbor, Dublin 2, Ireland (“Facebook”). The plugins can represent interaction elements or content (e.g. videos, graphics or text contributions) and can be recognized by one of the Facebook logos (white “f” on blue tile, the term “Like” or a “thumbs up” sign ) or are marked with the addition “Facebook Social Plugin”. The list and appearance of Facebook Social Plugins can be viewed here: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/.
Facebook is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement, which provides a guarantee to comply with European privacy legislation (https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000GnywAAC&status=Active.
When a user invokes a feature of this online offering that includes such a plugin, their device establishes a direct connection to the Facebook servers. The content of the plugin is transmitted by Facebook directly to the device of the user and incorporated by him into the online offer. In the process, user profiles can be created from the processed data. We therefore have no influence on the amount of data that Facebook collects with the help of this plugin and therefore inform the users according to our knowledge.
By integrating the plugins, Facebook receives the information that a user has accessed the corresponding page of the online offer. If the user is logged in to Facebook, Facebook can assign the visit to his Facebook account. If users interact with the plugins, for example press the “Like” button or leave a comment, the information is transmitted from your device directly to Facebook and stored there. If a user is not a member of Facebook, there is still the possibility that Facebook will find out and save their IP address. According to Facebook, only an anonymous IP address is stored in Germany.
The purpose and scope of the data collection and the further processing and use of the data by Facebook, as well as the related rights and setting options for protecting the privacy of users, can be found in Facebook’s privacy policy: https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/ .
If a user is a Facebook member and does not want Facebook to collect data about him via this online offer and link it to his member data stored on Facebook, he must log out of Facebook and delete his cookies before using our online offer. Other settings and inconsistencies regarding the use of data for advertising purposes are possible within the Facebook profile settings: https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads or via the US-American site http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or the EU page http://www.youronlinechoices.com/. The settings are platform independent, i.e. they are adopted for all devices, such as desktop computers or mobile devices.
Within our online offer, features and content of the Twitter service offered by Twitter Inc., 1355 Market Street, Suite 900, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA, may be incorporated. For this, e.g. content such as images, videos, or text and buttons that users use to promote their content, subscribe to content creators, or subscribe to our posts. If the users are members of the platform Twitter, Twitter can call the above-mentioned assign contents and functions to the profiles of the users there. Twitter is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement, which provides a guarantee to comply with European privacy legislation. (https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000TORzAAO&status=Active ). Privacy Policy: https://twitter.com/en/privacy , Opt-Out: https://twitter.com/personalization.
