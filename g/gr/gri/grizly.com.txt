7. How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals
We currently do not respond to do not track signals.
Access to Third Party Websites
You will be able to access third party websites directly from our Services. This privacy policy does not apply when you access third party websites. We cannot control how third parties may use personal information you disclose to them, so you should carefully review the privacy policy of any third-party website you visit, such as the third-party privacy policies we link to, before interacting with such third-party websites or disclosing your personal information to its provider.
Lawful Basis for Processing Personal Information
If you are in the European Economic Area or the United Kingdom, we process any personal information we collect in order to: (1) carry out our contractual obligations with you; (2) comply with our legal obligations; and (3) engage in activities that are in our legitimate interest, such as sending you direct marketing materials you request, providing you with an enjoyable experience, and to provide you with information related to our Services.
To the extent the processing of your personal information requires your consent, we will obtain such consent at the time we collect such information. This consent can be withdrawn at any time; provided, however, withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent. You can withdraw your consent by emailing us privacy@grizly.com.
*Your Rights*
Under the GDPR, individuals have a number of important rights free of charge. In summary, these include rights to:
*       * Access the personal information we have that concerns you;
* Require us to correct any mistakes in the personal information we have that concerns you;
* Require, in certain situations, the erasure of personal information we have that concerns you;
* Receive the personal information concerning you which you have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and have the right to transmit such data to a third party in certain situations;
* Object at any time to the processing of personal information concerning you for direct marketing;
* Object in certain other situations to our continued processing of your personal information; and
* Otherwise restrict our processing of your personal information in certain circumstances.
For more information on each of these rights, including the circumstances in which they apply, see the Guidance from the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) on individuals rights under the GDPR.
If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please:
*       * Email us at privacy@grizly.com;
* Let us have enough information to identify you; and
* Let us know the information to which your request relates.
If we cannot verify your identity, we may request proof of your identify, such as a copy of your driver’s license or passport.
We hope that we can resolve any query or concern you raise about our use of your information; however, the GDPR also gives you the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the European Union (or European Economic Area) state where you work, normally live, or where any alleged infringement of data protection laws occurred.

California Civil Code Section § 1798.83 permits users of our Services that are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an email to privacy@grizly.com.
International Processing
Our head office is located in Carlsbad, California, United States. We store and process your personal information on our computers and servers in the United States and, at times, depending on the cloud services we utilize, in various other countries. As such, that means that your personal information may need to be processed in countries where data protection and privacy laws and regulations may differ from those in your home country. In order to ensure your personal information is treated with the same level of care required in your home country, we require all authorized third parties, affiliates, and partners to take appropriate measures to keep your information confidential, safe, and secure in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
Data Retention
We will store your personal information only for as long as necessary to provide you with the services or information you require or request, or for as long as we are legally obligated to do so. We will also store certain personal information, such as email addresses, for archival purposes that are required for the continued operation of our business. For more information on where and how long your personal data is stored, and for more information on your rights of erasure and portability, please contact us at privacy@grizly.com.
Data Security
We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. All information we collect from you is stored in the cloud, which is encrypted by third-party systems. We limit access to your personal information to those who have a genuine business need to know it. Those processing your information will do so only in an authorized manner and are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Services, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to or through our Services. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. ‌
