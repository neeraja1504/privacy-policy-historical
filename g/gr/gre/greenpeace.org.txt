Use of Google Analytics
Greenpeace uses Google Analytics to gather visitors’ use of our website and analyze the data to help us maintain and improve the design of our website. Google Analytics generates statistical and other information about website use by means of cookies, which are stored on users’ computers.
Should you not be willing to get the analytics cookies, please change you cookies settings above (‘change your cookies preferences’).
As mentioned before, Google Analytics cookies used in this website are _utma, _utmb, _utmc, _utmz, _ga and _gid – and they all collect information in an anonymous form , including the number of visitors to the site, browser ClientID (to identify returning users, for example), where visitors come to the site from and the pages they visited. Here’s the privacy overview of Google Analytics, the Google Analytics Cookie Usage on Websites and here how to easily opt-out of Google Analytics cookies.
As of May 2018, Google Analytics introduced the Data Retention controls, giving organizations the ability to set the amount of time before user-level and event-level data stored by Google Analytics is automatically deleted from Analytics’ servers.
Such retention period applies to user-level and event-level data associated with cookies, user-identifiers (e.g., User-ID) and advertising identifiers (not applicable in Greenpeace websites anyway). For Greenpeace International, the Data Retention control for Google Analytics is set to 26 months. Once again, Analytics will not collect the internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your device to the internet.
Besides, it is important to mention that Google stores websites traffic information which have Google Analytics tracking code. Check Google’s privacy policy and how to opt-out of Google Analytics cookies.
You can install the “Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on” to prevent information about your visits to our website being sent to Google Analytics.
Use of social networks sharing buttons and widgets
Beside the customized HTML buttons we installed to allow you to share Greenpeace content on Facebook and Twitter, we may embed widgets from Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Soundcloud and other social media on our website to provide an enhanced experience.
These social networking  widgets come from web servers which may track your behaviour on our website and may combine this with other information about you originating from other websites. You can install a browser add-ons like “Privacy Badger” for Chrome or “Disconnect” for Chrome and Firefox to control some (the first) or disable them (the second).
