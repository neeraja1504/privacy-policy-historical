This Privacy Policy describes the practices that GREETINGQUBE, LLC d/b/a Greetabl (referred to as “Greetabl” or “we”) follows with respect to the collection, use, maintenance and disclosure of information collected through the website located at greetabl.com (the “Site”). This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect from this Site, and does not apply to any other website or business activity of greetabl. By using our Site, you consent to the collection, use, maintenance and disclosure of this information by us.
If you want to know what information we collect, why we collect it, and how it impacts you, then please take some time to read through our privacy policy:
What Information Do We Collect?
a. Personal Information – Personal information is any information that is considered personally identifiable, like your name, email address, phone number, mailing address or payment information, that allows us to identify or contact you. When you create an account with us, edit or update your account information, upload images or other content to our Site, or order or use any of our products or services, we may collect personal information.
We collect additional personal information when volunteered by you, such as information provided in surveys, blog comments, and emails.
You can choose not to provide personal information to us. However, if you do not provide such information, you may not be able to make a purchase or create an account, so your ability to use the Site will be limited.
b. Uploaded Images & Content – * We may collect additional information that you submit to the Site when designing a mailer or other packaging, including text, photographs and other images. We may collect technical information about those photographs and images (such as the file size and aspect ratio). *
c. Usage Information & Cookies – We may also collect “usage information”. It is information automatically collected by our web server (which may be hosted by a third-party) that your web browser makes available whenever you visit or use our Site. For example, we may collect your IP address, browser type, operating system version, and information regarding your browsing activities (e.g., information about the websites that you visit before or after visiting the Site) and geographic location. ****
We may also use cookies to collect information. Cookies are tiny text files that are stored on your computer or mobile device. Cookies help us to facilitate your shopping process, including making it possible for us to store information regarding your design, image, text and other selections for a mailer or packaging that you are designing, and the contents of your shopping cart. By doing this, we can personalize your experience and save you time during checkout.
It is possible to prevent cookies from being used by your browser. If you refuse to accept cookies, however, some portions of the Site may not function as intended.
d. Information Collected by Authorized Third Parties - We work with third parties to monitor our website for the purposes of obtaining information regarding website traffic and other statistics. Where authorized by us, these third parties may use cookies and/or other monitoring technologies to compile anonymous statistics about our website visitors. For example, this may include information regarding a visitor’s browsing activities, the pages and content viewed, the user’s geographic location, and the time and duration of visits . ****

The information we collect from these surveys, promotions, contests, and sweepstakes may be matched with individual customer accounts and used by Greetabl to contact you regarding our surveys, promotions, contests and sweepstakes and to improve your overall customer experience, and may be shared with third parties who provide services to us or on our behalf.
f. General Disclosure of Information - We may provide your personally identifiable information and usage information to third parties who provide services to us or on our behalf (e.g., those who help us fulfill or deliver your order, process payments, etc.).

We may disclose personal information and usage information to affiliated companies, our parent company and sister companies.
h. Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement – We may use and disclose your personal information and usage information when we have reason to believe that using and/or disclosing this information is necessary to investigate, identify, contact, or take action against someone who may have engaged in illegal or unethical activities or breached our Terms of Use or who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property, other users of our Site, or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities.
