Welcome to Great Girls Games.
After searching the internet for websites to play girls games on, I found that there were only a handful of them and even on those sites there wasn't much selection.
I then decided to create my own website, with a collection of games that I and my friends enjoy playing. So, Great Girls Games was born and now the site has one of the largest collections of games just for girls. Our site has games from all different categories, from Cooking Games, to Dress Up Games and even Celebrity Games.
All of the girls games are completely free to play, we will never charge you anything, because the site is kept alive by our sponsors and advertisements.
One of our most popular girls games categories is Dress Up Games , these games are really fun to play. If you enjoy dress up games then be sure to check them out.
Another popular type of game is Cooking Games , these range from cooking a pizza, baking a cake and even decorating cookies. If you enjoy cooking, then try our cooking games.
You should also try our makeover girl games and decor games.
GreatGirlsGames.com is the best place for girls games, so try out all our games and don't forget to tell your friends.
Have fun!
