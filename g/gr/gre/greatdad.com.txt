We may also ask for other information at other times but at no time will you be required to share any personal information to gain complete access to our site. In addition to personal information—such as name, street and e-mail addresses, and telephone numbers—we may also collect information that is in no way personally identifiable. This may include the operating system you are working on, the internet browser you are using, the domain name of your internet service provider, and the web sites you visit directly before and after your visit to GreatDad.com.
How does GreatDad.com use my personal information?
The more we know about you, the better we are able to customize our web site to suit your personal preferences and interests. The e-mail address you provide may be used by GreatDad.com for any reason, such as contacting you for editorial purposes or to advise you of any changes to our site. We may also, from time to time, send you messages about our marketing partners’ products.

We also use the information you give us to help our advertisers target the audience they want to reach. At no time does any party other than GreatDad.com have access to your personally identifiable information, and you will never be contacted by any party other than GreatDad.com. The only exceptions to the foregoing are that we may disclose personally identifiable information (i) in response to legal process, for example, in response to a court order or subpoena, (ii) in response to a law enforcement agency’s request, or where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take actions regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of another person, violations of our terms of use, or as otherwise required by law, or (iii) in the event we are acquired by or merged with another company. When you sign up for our updates or receive e-mail messages from GreatDad.com, you will always be given the chance to opt-out of special offers and site updates. You may change your preferences at any time and will only be contacted in manners consistent with your stated preferences. Non-personally identifiable information (such as stated above) may be shared in aggregate form with our advertisers or marketing partners but your personally identifiable information will never be disclosed to them.
Who else has access to my personal information?
The ads appearing on GreatDad.com are delivered to you by our Web advertising partners.
