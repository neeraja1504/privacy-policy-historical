Obtaining Consent
3.5 Obtaining Consent
3.5.1 For visitors to the website, at the top of the home page there is a notice alerting the visitor to the use of cookies on the Great Run website. The notice gives the option to accept the use of cookies on the Great Run website.
3.5.2 By choosing to accept their use, a cookie is placed on the visitor’s computer so that the Great Run website can ‘remember’ the visitor’s preference. On subsequent visits to the website, if the presence of the cookie is detected the notice will not appear.

However, if you browse the Great Run website having opted to disallow cookies you will still be able to use the website but certain features and functionality will be lost.
3.5.6 If you choose to ignore the notice but continue using the website, depending on the settings on your browser, cookies will be set. If you are at all concerned about cookies, we recommend that you do not use the Great Run website until you have clearly understood the implications or have altered your browser settings accordingly.
