Privacy Policy
Summary
This site collects no more data about you than most other websites.
Any information submitted to the site for public consumption is published and except in very limited circumstances, will be a permanent part of this site. If you decide to post comments, links, or any other information you must keep this in mind.
This privacy policy will be reviewed, and may be revised, from time to time. You may wish to revisit it regularly.
Public data and publishing
Browsing this site doesn’t reveal your identity publicly, though see Private Logging later in this document for more information.
Author identification
When creating an account, a name and email address are required. You do not have to select your real name. Your email address will not be published.
Cookies
The software running this site uses cookies if you create an account. This is a convenience for you so that you do not need to type in the same information the next time you visit.
Google, as a third party vendor, uses the Doubleclick DART cookie to serve ads on this site. The use of this cookie enables Google and its partners to serve ads based on users' visits to this site and other sites on the internet. Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie at any time by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy.
You may wish to clear these cookies and the browser cache if you wish to refrain from revealing any identifying information, especially if you are using a public or shared computer.
Third Parties
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click here.
Private logging
Any time you visit a page on the internet, you send quite a bit of information to the server. The webservers that host this site maintain access logs with the information that you send. This information is used to provide site statistics and to get an idea of popular pages and what sites link here. We do not intend to use these logs to identify legitimate users.
The data logged may be used by us to solve technical problems with the site and, in cases of abuse of this site, to investigate the abuse.
If you are concerned about attempts to match your IP address to your identity, you may wish to use an anonymous browsing service or attempt some means to obfuscate your real IP address.
If so, you might like to try Tor, an anonymous browsing service. Please see http://tor.eff.org/ for more details.
Data release policy
Our policy is to only release the data we collect in the following circumstances:
As required by law, such as in response to a valid request from law enforcement.
To designated third parties to resolve or investigate abuse complaints.
When the information is related to spiders or bots, usually when investigating technical issues.
For abusive users, we may release information to assist in attempting to block the abusive user or to complain to that user’ s Internet Service Provider.
If necessary to defend legal claims against us by third parties.
When we deem it necessary to protect the property or rights of the user community, or this website.
Information security
We make no guarantee that the information that you provide us will be secure.
Email
You are required to give your email address when you create an account. This email address will not be published. This email address will not be sold to any third party.
If you are concerned, you may wish to get a free email account or attempt to use a remail service, or use a fake email address as no attempt is made to validate it, other than ensuring it is in the form of an email address. However, a valid email is required if you wish to reset your account password.
