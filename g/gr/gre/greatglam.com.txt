2) We hate spam as much as you do. Actually, I think we hate it more since we get something like 100-odd junk e-mails each day! So, we will NEVER send you any unsolicited junk e-mail. If you register or choose to subscribe to our free mailing list, you will receive your newsletter no more often than 3 times a week. Clear unsubscribe details are always shown on the newsletter.
3) This site does use cookies. However, we do not keep any of your personal details on cookies. We simply store your Customer ID (just a number) in cookie format. This Customer ID does not correlate to any of your personal information. We also store your first name on cookie format to personalize this website. We reserve the right to at any time after receipt of your order to accept or decline your order or part of an order for any reason. In the event that an order or part of an order is declined we will refund the payment for the declined items. We also reserve the right to block customers from purchasing at our sole discretion for any reason. If a blocked customer attempts to circumvent the block their order will be cancelled and a cancellation fee will apply.
4)We reserve the right to,and at our sole discretion, to reject returns or exchanges of items that are not any one of the following: in original unworn condition,free of odor, with all tags attached and postmarked within 3 weeks of the order date(6 weeks international orders). Additionally we charge a restocking fee to customers who order more the one of the exact same style and color in different sizes intending to try them both on and then return the one that doesn't fit. We request that customers do not do this. This is very costly for us because it ties up our inventory and wastes our warehouse staff's time. It is also very unfair to other customers because our items are only available in very limited quantities.  In cases where a customer has bought more than one size of the exact same style and color in the same day and then sends just some sizes back we will charge a 8.99 per item restocking fee. This fee only applies in cases where more than one size of the exact same style and color has been purchased by a customer and that same item is then returned. In cases where a customer repeatedly does this we also reserve the right to cancel that customers order(s) and bar that customer from ordering. If an item is sent back soiled such that it requires cleaning there will be a 1.99 cleaning fee.  If the credit card you paid with has expired at the time we process your return, or you used paypal and more than 60 days have elapsed, or you paid for all or part of your order with a gift certificate your refund can only be issued in the form of a gift certificate. Buy It Don't like it keep it for free policy is a courtesy credit extended at our discretion. We reserve the right to request that you instead mail back items in cases where the use of this policy is excessive.
Free shipping is promotional and has a value of the current stated shipping rates on our site at the time of return. If you return your entire order the free shipping promotional value will be deducted. If you receive a promotional discount based on the value of your order and after your return your order falls below the promotional value the discount will be deducted.
