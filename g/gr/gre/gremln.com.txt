Other than the following instances, Gremln does not rent, sell or share personal information about you with any other person(s) or organization(s):
Gremln may share your information with outsourced service providers in order to provide the materials you requested. For example, to fill an order for training materials, your name, address, and phone number may be provided to a third-party order filling agency so they can ship you the materials.
When the law requires Gremln to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process, Gremln provides the information needed to obey the law. Gremln also may provide information in order to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.
Gremln believes it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.
Gremln may also share your information with Partner organizations and associations. Because Gremln is in no way responsible for the actions of their Partners, Gremln can not be held liable for their Partners’ use (or misuse) of personal information.
Gremln makes every reasonable effort to ensure the security of the data it collects. However, Gremln cannot warrant against the disclosure of this information in the event of a security breach or other event beyond our control.
