US Privacy Policy
PRIVACY POLICY
**This Privacy Policy was last updated: April 5, 2019.    Updated section entitled “What Personal Information Does Greystar Collect?”, “What Information Do We Share or Disclose,” “Third-Party Site Links” and “Notification of Changes,” and added sections entitled “Notice to California Residents,” and “Do-Not-Track Disclosures; Third-Party Tracking.” **
This Privacy Policy applies to the Greystar.com website operated by Greystar Worldwide, LLC and its affiliates (referred to herein as "Greystar", "we", "us", or "our") and to information provided by website users in the U.S.  This Privacy Policy does not apply to any information collected online or offline but not collected via the greystar.com website and any other website linking to this Privacy Policy.  This Privacy Policy does not change or impact any separate written agreements with Greystar.
Greystar recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of individual-specific information ("Personal Information") collected from and about our website users (referred to as "you" or "your" in this Privacy Policy). This Privacy Policy describes what Personal Information we gather, how we use it and how you can correct, change and limit our use of it. It is our intention to give you as much control over your Personal Information as possible to preserve your privacy, while still allowing us to utilize that Personal Information to provide you a valuable service and hopefully to have you as a resident of one of our communities. In some instances, and in particular, if you are asked to submit registration details through this site, you may be requested to agree to additional terms regarding our use of your Personal Information, and those additional terms will apply in that context. Any additional terms will be provided for your review at the time of registration.
This Privacy Policy constitutes an integral part of our website’s Terms of Use and is subject to the provisions thereof, including with respect to Limitation of Liability and governing law. We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy before you send or share Personal Information with us or use our website and to read it again when you return to it.
WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DOES GREYSTAR COLLECT?
We collect Personal Information from our websites to provide you with information on the Greystar products and services you have expressed an interest in and to provide you with information on other similar Greystar products and services we believe will be of interest to you and to better understand how we can help prospective residents, current residents and employees.
The type of Personal Information we collect will depend upon what we will need to provide you with the product or service you are interested in. Prospective residents (“future residents”) will be asked to include most of the following further information: first and last name, primary phone number, email address, the apartment size you are looking for (number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms), where you want to live (e.g., city and state or community name), the type of building you prefer, your proposed rent budget, move-in date, desired lease term, and whether or not you have pets (if so, what type), and any additional comments you wish to provide.
Current residents of one of our residential communities will be asked to provide an apartment number, first and last name, phone number, email address, reason for contacting us, and any additional comments.
For those interested in booking corporate housing stays, you can view available listings on our site.  We use separate sites for booking corporate stays and you will be redirected to those websites, which have their own privacy policy.
For those interested in applying for employment at Greystar, the following Personal Information may be requested or obtained: name and address, age or date of birth, email address, occupation, employment information, telephone number, educational background and Social Security/national insurance number, credit checks, background checks and employment verification.  Although most, if not all, of that Personal Information is requested or obtained by third-party sites that are beyond our control, some of that Personal Information could be requested or obtained via the greystar.com website.  See also Third-Party Site Links below.   Where required, we will obtain your consent before undertaking these checks. Once a candidate accepts a position, the candidate may be asked to complete further online details. T his may include an invitation to self-identify ethnicity or race. This information is only collected for meeting government reporting requirements and the provision of this information by candidates is voluntary.
Our residential communities have their own separate sites and we use separate sites for the processing of rental applications and agreements and to assist our residents with other tasks which are required or helpful to them, such as paying rent online. You will move away from this site when engaging in those activities and those sites will have their own privacy policies, and so please review that privacy policy before using those separate sites. _See also Third-Party Site Links below._
We may receive information about you, including Personal Information, from third parties.  For example, if you are on another website and you opt-in to receive information from us, that website will forward to us your email address and other information about you so that we may contact you as requested.
USAGE TRACKING: USE OF IP ADDRESSES
An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Internet. Web servers, the main computers that serve up web pages, automatically identify your computer by its IP address. As permitted under applicable law, Greystar collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, gathering and analyzing aggregated information, creating a better experience for users and auditing the use of our site.
We do not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that your session will be logged, but you remain anonymous to us. We will seek to link your IP address when we feel it is necessary to protect this site and other users from harm and to prevent criminal misconduct. Please see the section on Use of "Cookies."
USE OF "COOKIES"
Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to an individual for record¬keeping purposes. Cookies make web surfing easier for you by saving your preferences while you are at our site. The use of cookies is an industry standard, and as such, you will find them at most major websites. By showing how and when users use a site, cookies help us see which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the site are based on such data as total number of visitors and pages viewed. This information is most easily tracked with cookies. We use the information from cookies only to provide services better tailored to your needs and for the protection of our website and users from potential harm. We never save passwords or credit card information in cookies.
We use persistent tracking cookies on our website which are cookies that stay in your web browser between visits. These cookies can also be used to show us which sites you have visited before entering our site and which sites you may go to if you leave, especially if you access the registered user parts of this site by using your social media log-in credentials.  We use these to capture analytical information about our visitors that helps us to improve the performance of our website and create a better experience. These cookies allow us to recognize and count the number of visitors, to provide content related to a prior visit to the website, to see how visitors move around the site and the products and services they are interested in when they are using it and to see what other types of products and services they may be interested in. This helps us to improve the way our website works, for example by making sure users are finding what they need easily.
We may also use cookies which allow us or third parties to advertise our products and services on websites that you access after you have visited our site.  You may also see advertisements from us if other websites you visit capture through a cookie that you have been on our site.  These ad preference cookies are often used by search engine sites.  Our cookies can be disabled as indicated below. To prevent this advertising, you may also need to review the cookies disabling information on the other sites you visit.
Most browsers are set up to accept cookies. If you want to change your cookie preferences, you can do so through your browser settings or refuse the cookies when you enter the website. You may also limit the information we gain from certain cookies by logging directly into the registered areas of this site rather than by logging in by using your social media log-in credentials.  Please remember that our cookies are often used to give you certain functionality and without them you may not be able to use some of our website e.g. save properties from our listings.
You can also remove cookies that have already been set in your browser via your browser settings.

By using this website and providing your Personal Information, you consent to this transfer, provided use of the Personal Information will remain in accordance with the Privacy Policy in place at the time of the transfer.
THIRD-PARTY SITE LINKS
You should be aware that when you are on the Greystar website you could be directed to other third-party sites that are beyond our control, including, without limitation, to the websites of residential communities. There are links to other sites from Greystar, which take you outside our service. For example, if you "click" on a banner, an advertisement or a search result, the "click" may take you off the Greystar site. These other sites may include sites of other advertisers, sponsors and partners that may use their logo with ours as part of a co-branding agreement. These other sites may send their own cookies to visitors to collect data or solicit information. Greystar does not control these sites and therefore is not responsible for their content. The inclusion of hyperlinks to any other sites by Greystar does not imply any endorsement of the material on such sites, nor any association with their operators.
Greystar policies do not extend to anything that is inherent in the operation of the Internet, which is beyond our control. Remember that whenever you give out Personal Information online, that information may be collected and used by people you do not know.
SECURING INFORMATION
Greystar takes reasonable technical and organizational measures in accordance with applicable laws to safeguard users' Personal Information. While Greystar strives to protect your Personal information and therein your privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any Personal Information you disclose online, and you therefore disclose such Personal Information at your own risk.
We limit access to Personal Information to employees who we believe reasonably need to receive such information to provide our services or to do their jobs, and we take the precautions we deem reasonable to protect the security of users' Personal Information. We also work very hard to ensure that our employees are aware of the sensitivity of the data submitted to us and that they handle it with care, being careful not to allow any improper access by third parties. However, as in many computer systems, internet applications and software programs, unauthorized use, failure of hardware or software, etc. may be injurious to the confidentiality of users' Personal Information.
If users have any questions about security, please contact us using the information in the "Contact Information" section.
ENCRYPTION
Because the security of all Personal Information associated with our users is of utmost concern to us, we periodically review and improve our security and this Privacy Policy as necessary when new technology becomes available. This includes use of software which encrypts (generally processed at 256 bits) or distorts data submitted to us relating to an online Rental Application or employment application.
EMAIL CONSENT AND OPT-OUT
Your provision of Personal Information through any of our registration forms on this site constitutes your affirmative consent that we may contact you by email to provide you with information and notices relating to the property where you reside, on various similar services available to you at or through that property and on various other properties that may be available and of interest to you in the future. It also means we may email you regarding updates to this Privacy Policy.
You may choose to opt out of receiving future commercial email messages from us by using this site. Each mass commercial email sent by us contains a link with instructions on how to remove yourself from our email list. Please note that if you are a resident of a Greystar community and you use this site and your community site, you will need to opt-out of your community site separately.
