GREAT MINDS PRIVACY POLICY
Last Updated: June 22, 2018
Great Minds and Great Minds LLC (“Great Minds”) seek to ensure that all students, regardless of their circumstance, receive a content-rich education in the full range of the liberal arts and sciences, including English, mathematics, history, the arts, science, and foreign languages. Great Minds does this by working with teachers, scholars, and schools to create curricula and instructional materials, conduct research, and promote policies that support a comprehensive and high-quality education in America’s public schools.
We are so grateful that you have given Great Minds your trust and have chosen to join us in this crucial work; keeping your trust through the protection of your privacy is of utmost importance to us.
This Privacy Policy explains the types of information that Great Minds collects from you, why we collect it, and how we will use, share, and protect your information.

This Privacy Policy also covers Great Minds’ treatment of any personal information about our users that our partners or other services might share with us. We will collect, use, and share your personal information only in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to websites, services, or practices of companies that Great Minds doesn’t own or control, such as third-party services you might access through links or other features on the Great Minds Website.
