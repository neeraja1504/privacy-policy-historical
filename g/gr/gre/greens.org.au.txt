Trackers
Our website uses trackers to monitor how visitors find and use our site. We report on this activity in aggregate, and use this information for the purposes of improving our website and how we engage our audience.
In addition to these, your browser may load trackers from external third party services when you use a page on our website. These trackers are specific to the third-party and accordingly the data held in them can be seen and managed by the third party and not by us.
We use a variety of widely used third-party plugins to help improve your experience while using our site. We control whether or not we use the third-party service with our website, and how it is integrated and presented on our website. We do not have control over the trackers themselves. No personal information is maintained which might identify an individual should they visit our website at a later date.
Whilst every attempt has been made to protect visitors’ privacy, The Australian Greens accept no fault if these systems result in a breach of privacy.
If you have concerns about the privacy implications of the trackers we use, you can block trackers using the cookie management tools in your web browser. Additional steps to protect your privacy online can be found in these recommendations from the Electronic Frontiers Foundation.
