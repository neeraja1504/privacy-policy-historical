Privacy Policy - Green Wedding Shoes
Updated October 26, 2018
We’ve recently updated both our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service to improve transparency and communicate your control over your data.
Transparency :  We want to ensure you understand the type of data we collect from you, where we store it and how it’s safeguarded.
Control :  Your data is  your data. We’ve always treated it as such and will continue to do so. You have the ability to opt in and out of emails, correct inaccurate data, delete your data and, if you’re a vendor with a Green Wedding Shoes profile,  delete your account at any time.
This Privacy Policy discloses the privacy practices of Green Wedding Shoes, LLC. and greenweddingshoes.com, our email newsletters and other applications owned and operated by Green Wedding Shoes, LLC. (collectively referred to as the “GWS Services”), and to any services that display this notice. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, unless otherwise noted, all references to “Green Wedding Shows” include greenweddingshoes.com.
The GWS Services may contain links to other websites for your convenience and information. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those sites.
What information do we gather about you?
The information gathered when you interact with the GWS Services falls into two categories:
Personal information:  This includes personal information you supply when you subscribe, order, complete a survey, enter a contest, create a vendor profile, submit content for editorial consideration or provide your email address
Non-personal information:  This information is collected through technology, which includes tracking information collected by us as well as third parties.
Personal Information That You Give Us Or Ask a Third Party to Share with Us
Billing and Credit Card Information
To enable payment for GWS Services we collect and store name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card information and other billing information. This information will only be shared with third parties who help to complete the purchase transaction. Examples of this include fulfilling orders and processing credit card payments.
User Generated Content and Public Activities (Including Comments)
We offer you opportunities to engage in public activities on greenweddingshoes.com and other GWS Services. “Public activities” are any actions you take on greenweddingshoes.com that are designed to be visible to other users, including comments, submitting content to be considered for editorial features or any other items that you submit. Any information you disclose in your public activities, along with your screen name or ID, or any images or photos, becomes public and may be used by Green Wedding Shoes for online and offline promotional or commercial uses in any and all media. If you choose to engage in public activities, you should be aware that any personal information you submit can be read, collected and used by other users of these areas. We are not responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in the course of your public activities and we have no responsibility to publish, take down, remove or edit any of your public activities or submissions. For more information, read the Forums, Discussions and User Generated Content section of the Terms of Service.
Public activities may be included in our RSS feeds and other distribution formats. As a result, your public activities may appear on other websites, blogs, feeds or social networks. Keep in mind that we are not responsible for any personal information you choose to make public via your public activities, and you agree that such sharing will be deemed to have been done by you, not Green Wedding Shoes.
When you share or recommend links to content on a third-party platform (including but not limited to Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Google+ and Twitter), that action and any information you share will be covered by their privacy policy.
Contests, Sweepstakes and Special Offers
Green Wedding Shoes collects personal information from you when you participate in sweepstakes, contests or special offers. If this information is also being collected by a third party other than Green Wedding Shoes, we will notify you at the same time. If you do not want any personal information shared, you should not participate in the sweepstakes, contest or special offer.
Reader Surveys, Reader Panels and Market Research
Green Wedding Shoes may collect personal information from you in connection with voluntary surveys conducted via the GWS Services. Data may be collected through the GWS Services, on the phone or through the mail. The information you provide may be shared, but only in the aggregate, with advertisers and partners unless we notify you otherwise at the time of collection.
Participants in our polls or discussions about their readership of Green Wedding Shoes, agree to voluntarily share information about their household/personal characteristics and their purchase behavior.
