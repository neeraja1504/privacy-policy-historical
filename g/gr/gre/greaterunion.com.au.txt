What is Cookie Information?
We may collect information and data when you visit our website using cookies, tags, pixels and other similar technologies ( Cookie Information ). Cookie Information includes pieces of information that websites can transfer to an individual’s computer hard drive for record keeping, such as the IP address of a user’s computer, the URL of a page visited and the time the page was visited by the user. The collection and use of Cookie Information is an industry standard and many websites collect this information.
Cookie Information is useful for facilitating a user’s access to and use of a site. It allows us to track usage patterns and compile data that can help us improve our services to you.  We do not use Cookie Information to identify you as an individual.
Cookie Information is useful to advertisers because it helps them understand their advertising audience, and to deliver advertising.
How do we use Cookie Information?
We may use Cookie Information, or engage third parties who collect similar information and data from publicly available sources, to deliver or modify advertising (including re-marketing) that is customised or more relevant to your interests, characteristics or general location ( Targeted Advertising ).
In order to carry out Targeted Advertising we may build a user and/or device profile by:
(a)             using Cookie Information and de-identified system information that we hold;
(b)             using device-matching technologies that utilise mobile device advertising identifiers as well as Cookie Information; and
(c)             engaging or working with third parties who provide the EVENT Group with information about you collected from publicly available sources or from their own databases.
We may also work with other companies to advertise their products and services online using Cookie Information. When we provide Cookie Information to third parties, we take commercially reasonable steps to ensure that that information is de-identified.
To whom do we disclose Cookie Information?
Examples of third parties that we may work with and disclose Cookie Information to include external companies and agencies that provide programmatic advertising services, specialist data companies, advertising platform providers, advertising servers, data partners, specialist data providers and social media operators such as Facebook.
How can you control Cookie Information?
The settings of most web browsers can be modified to prevent the collection of Cookie Information. You can also delete Cookie Information from your device.
Most mobile devices using common operating systems such as Android or iOS record a unique advertising identifier. This identifier may be part of the Cookie Information we collect, and can be reset in the device settings.
8                Storage and security of your personal information
We generally store the personal information that we collect in electronic databases, some of which may be held on our behalf by third party data storage providers located in Australia.
We may also, at times, keep hard copy records of personal information in physical storage facilities.  We use a range of physical and technical security processes and procedures to protect the confidentiality and security of the information that we hold, and we update these from time to time to address new and emerging security threats.
9                Access to and correction of personal information
You have a right to access and correct most of the personal information we hold about you.  If you wish to access or correct your personal information, please contact us via the details provided below.
To protect the integrity and security of the information we hold, we may ask that you follow a defined access procedure, which may include steps to verify your identity.  In certain cases we may charge you an administration fee for providing you with access to the information you have asked for, but we will inform you of this before proceeding.  There may be cases where we are unable to provide the information you request, such as where it would interfere with the privacy of others or result in a breach of confidentiality.  In these cases we will let you know why we cannot comply with your request.
Cinebuzz members can also update their membership profile online at:
