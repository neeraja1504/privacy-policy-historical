We may collect and process information about you when you:
buy tickets;
travel on our services;
visit our stations or car parks;
use our website, apps or Wi-Fi;
buy a product from us or make a sales enquiry;
contact customer relations;

An accident or injury occurs at our stations or on our trains.

We collect information such as your contact details, ticket purchases, stations visited (for example for charging the correct fares on smart cards), payment and refund details. We may require additional details for some services, such as your age for age restricted tickets. This information is generally provided by you.
Sometimes we obtain details from third parties, for example if our Group structure changes or for legitimate business reasons.
HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION
We will only use the information you provide as permitted by Data Protection Law (DPL). Our reason(s) for using your data will vary depending on: how you contact us, use our services, the consent you have given, our legitimate interests, or legal obligations we may have. Reasons for use of your data include:
To provide you with the service - things like carrying out our obligations arising from any contracts - selling tickets, making and taking payments. We mostly rely on the legal ground of contractual performance to process your data, but sometimes the data is also used for our legitimate interests of customer service, health and safety, improving our services and other legal obligations, like providing information to our regulators
To provide you with details of our services, information about travelling and customer service - this is based on our legitimate interests, to run train and associated services. Sometimes it is part of our contract or our other legal obligations
To provide you with details of promotions and offers which we feel may interest you; this is based on our legitimate interests to try and sell more train tickets when you have given consent for us to contact you and you have an absolute right to ask us to stop sending marketing emails/SMS
To run our services and improve them - we believe in investing in our railway services, not just to benefit passengers but also the wider community, environment, and economy. There are lots of activities we do to achieve this, some are administrative, and we also do things like monitoring passenger numbers, and popular stations, improving technology to help plan journeys - make money, run our services safely and be a good employer - we call these our legitimate interests. Some of these are also covered in our legal obligations, not just to customers, but under Franchise Contracts, the Department for Transport or Regulators. Some data is also shared to run interoperable services – in the Rail Industry this is overseen by the Rail Delivery Group - this is how you are able to use a ticket on a train and tube for example, or use a rail Discount card.
For your safety and security.
For fraud and crime prevention.
To enhance your experience of our website, as described in our cookie policy.
To run competitions
We are part of a Group of Companies and share administrative services and support. Your data may therefore be shared with other Group companies where appropriate. We are also required to pass certain customer data to successor franchisees, Secretary of State or Department for Transport.
Our Legitimate Interests
Running our business and Group businesses, in a safe and socially and environmentally responsible manner, efficiently, to provide sustainable and high quality, locally focused passenger transport services, improve and expand our services, be a leading employer in the transport sector, investing in and developing our staff, operating with financial discipline and reducing crime and fraud to provide shareholder value, provide and improve customer services.
SHARING OR DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION
We will only share or disclose your information as set out in this Policy or in accordance with DPL and will obtain your consent where we are required to do so. We will only use third parties to process information where we are satisfied that they comply with these standards and can keep your data secure.
Due to the nature of the services we provide, we process a large range of data, in a manner of ways, across a number of solutions. Accordingly, it was deemed impractical to set out the details of all the third parties that we may share your data with below. You can find out more about the information we collect and how we use, share or disclose it below or by contacting us at GDPR@greateranglia.co.uk
We may share or disclose information for the following reasons:
We use data processors to provide or assist with some of our services, for example, the processing of bookings. Where we do so, they must agree to strict contractual terms and to keep your data secure;
Where we share data across our Group Companies, this is only in accordance with a written data sharing agreement;
To operate interoperable services - this includes use of some shared systems and processors, by the rail industry generally and overseen by the Rail Delivery Group;
To respond to your complaints or administer requests you have made, either to us or another regulatory body such as the Department for Transport; Passenger Focus, London Travelwatch, the Rail Complaints Ombudsman or other Train Operating Companies (TOCs);
To process payment card transactions;
To comply with requests from the British Transport Police under an Information Sharing Protocol, ensuring that any disclosure is lawful;
To comply with the police or other law enforcement agencies for the purposes of crime prevention or detection, these are dealt with on a case-by-case basis, under a specific Information Sharing Protocol, to ensure that any disclosure is lawful;
To comply with other legal obligations for example, relating to crime and taxation purposes or regulatory activity;
To protect our legitimate business interests, as outlined above;
Where required because of the sale, merger, or acquisition of business assets. As the Railway Industry is run on a system of franchises, we are required to transfer our customer data to a successor franchise, or the Secretary of State, this is so that they can take over and continue the running of the railway service;
In respect of information provided to us for marketing purposes only (including freely given consent), to the Department for Transport and/or any successor operator of the rail franchise in order that they may contact you for marketing purposes in the event that we cease to operate this rail franchise;
If you have agreed (via freely given consent) to receive information for competition, promotion, survey or research purposes, we may share your contact details with a limited number of parties, but only for the reasons you have agreed to in the terms and conditions of the purpose; and
Where you have consented, to share with other members of the Abellio Group UK (“Abellio”), of which we are a member, where Abellio has any services, promotions and offers which we feel may interest you. Details of other members of Abellio can be found here.
TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT
CCTV
Camera systems we operate
Our CCTV is used to capture, record and monitor images of what takes place at our stations and car parks and on our trains, in real time. In limited circumstances, we use body worn cameras which make audio visual recordings.
Depending on the type of camera, images are recorded on video tape (analogue) or as digital information. Cameras can be fixed or set to scan an area. In some circumstances, they can be operated remotely by controllers.
Why we operate CCTV cameras
We operate CCTV for the following purposes:
Health and safety of employees, passengers and other members of the public;
Crowd management; and
Prevention and detection of crime and anti-social behaviour.
Camera locations
We operate cameras at the stations and car parks we manage and on some of the trains that we run.
We operate cameras at some of the stations and car parks across our network, for a full list of stations and car parks and operators please click https://www.greateranglia.co.uk/
Network Rail and other TOCs operate the cameras at some stations that our services stop at. These are shown below:
London Liverpool Street
Peterborough
Stratford
Kings Lynn
Seven Kings
Gidea Park
Harold Wood
Romford
Brentwood
Edmonton Green
Hackney Downs
We operate CCTV on some of the trains that we run.
Length of time CCTV footage is kept
CCTV footage at stations and on train is generally held for a maximum of 30 days from the time of recording.
On train CCTV footage varies depending on the classification of train;
Class 317 - 7 days
Class 379 - 10 days
Class 321 - 30 days
Class 360 - 30-40 days
Recordings from body worn cameras are generally held for 28 days, unless required for legitimate business reasons.
How to access your CCTV personal data
You can request copies of images or footage of yourself by making a Subject Access Request to GDPR@greateranglia.co.uk
Please note that it may not always be possible to fulfil these requests because of the necessity to protect third party data.
Disclosing CCTV/personal data to the police
At our discretion, we may disclose CCTV/personal data in response to valid requests from the police and other statutory law enforcement agencies.
Before we authorise any disclosure, the police have to demonstrate that the CCTV/personal data is necessary to assist them in the prevention or detection of a specific crime, or in the apprehension or prosecution of an offender.
Requests from the police are dealt with on a case-by-case basis to ensure that any such disclosure is lawful in accordance with the DPL.
Sharing CCTV footage with other third parties
Some of our CCTV infrastructure is shared with the British Transport Police, Local Authorities, Network Rail, and Car Park operators under formal data sharing agreement.
In certain agreed circumstances, they may take control of a limited number of cameras and use them for activities such as the prevention and detection of crime and anti-social behaviour, policing major events and crowd control. AEA is not responsible for the CCTV when it is in the control of a third party.
We may also disclose personal data to third parties, if required to by law or it is necessary for a legitimate purpose such as defending or bringing legal action. DPL allows us to do this where the request is supported by:
evidence of the relevant legislation
a court order
satisfactory evidence and assurances of the legitimate interest.
Legitimate interest would include requests such as defending or making a legal claim, such as to insurers following a vehicle collision in a carpark. When we are not required to provide CCTV, we will take into account the circumstances and any potential harm to individuals, we may also charge a fee and seek indemnity for any use beyond which it is requested.
External guidelines and best practice
AEA operates its CCTV systems in compliance with the CCTV Code of Practice issued by the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) in 2017. The Code describes best practice standards which should be followed by organisations operating devices which view or record images of individuals. It also covers other information derived from those images that relates to individuals (for example vehicle registration marks).

The right may be restricted if it is not practical for us to provide the information in this way or it adversely affects the rights of others.
INFORMATION ABOUT PROFILING AND AUTOMATED DECISION MAKING
We target some of our marketing and service communications so that they are more relevant to you, based on the type of ticket(s) you bought and your location/travel stations. We will try and ensure where possible the communications are compatible with the device you are using.
We use automated decision making to calculate the validity and value of Delay Repay claims made through our website. You will receive a notification of the outcome of your claim. At this stage you are able to request that your claim is manually reviewed by a member of the Delay Repay team. If you remain dissatisfied, you are able to escalate to our Customer Relations team.
HOW WE DEAL WITH RIGHTS REQUESTS
We are not able to charge you a fee for dealing with rights requests, unless they are manifestly unfounded or excessive or in circumstances where copies have been provided previously. We would always let you know if we thought this was the case, so that you can make a decision about what you wanted to do next.
There are various limitations and exemptions in relation to the exercise of rights in DPL - for example if it would affect another’s rights and freedoms or if we need to retain the information to make or defend a legal claim. We intend only to rely on limitations and exemptions where it is fair to do so and always bearing in mind that it is your personal data.
