This website is provided by Oxbridge Solutions Limited, registered in England and Wales under company number 2592842 at Ground Floor, 108 Cannon Street, London, EC4N 6EU, UK.
We take very seriously the privacy of our website users and the security of their personal information.
This Privacy Policy together with our Terms and Conditions (https://www.gpnotebook.co.uk/TnC.cfm) set out the principles governing our use of personal information which you give or we obtain about you. By using this website you agree to this use. We ask you to read this Privacy Policy carefully. Any dispute which may arise over privacy will be subject to this policy, any data collection notice incorporated into this website and the provisions of English law.
We may change our Privacy Policy from time to time. Therefore we ask you to check this Privacy Policy occasionally to ensure that you are aware of the most recent version which will apply each time you access this website.
DESCRIPTION OF THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT
Personal Information
If you have filled in a registration form either on this or a third party site then we will collect personally identifiable information about you, such as your name, e-mail address, country of residence and other information which you voluntarily submit. If you contact us we may keep a record of that correspondence. We may also collect information about how you in particular use this website through the use of cookies (see below).
When you submit personal information you consent to our use of the information as set out in this Privacy Policy.
This information helps us to personalise your experience by tailoring the content you see, optimising your enjoyment of the website.
We may also obtain information about your opinions if, for example, you send us feedback, or ask us questions.
We may also, occasionally, receive information about you from other sources (such as third parties or associated sites) which we will add to the information which we already hold about you in order to help us improve and personalise our service to you.
We use Google Analytics tracking to track user activity. The data we collect about users in Google Analytics can be connected to other data we have about the end user, as per the measurement policy supplied by Google. We will not upload any data that allows Google to personally identify an individual (such as certain names, Social Security Numbers, email addresses, or any similar data), or data that permanently identifies a particular device (such as a unique device identifier if such an identifier cannot be reset)
Use of Cookies
In common with many organisations we monitor the use of this website by collecting aggregate information through the use of cookies. No personally identifiable data are collected in this process. Typically, we collect information about the number of visitors to the website, to each web page and the originating domain name of the visitor's Internet Service Provider. This information helps us to improve our site and to deliver a more personalised service and may be shared with third parties.
A cookie is a small file which is placed on your computer's hard drive. The file is added and the cookie helps analyse web traffic or lets you know when you visit a particular site. Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual. The web application can tailor its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your preferences.
We use traffic log cookies to identify which pages are being used. This helps us analyse data about web page traffic and improve our website in order to tailor it to customer needs. We only use this information for statistical analysis purposes and then the data is removed from the system.
Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better website, by enabling us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us.
Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. This may prevent you from taking full advantage of the website.
Some of our advertising banners may send a cookie to your hard disk (whether or not you click the banner). If you subsequently visit the advertised website we will know that you have seen our banner. This allows us to keep track of the success rates of such banners.
The majority of web browsers accept cookies, but you can usually change the web browser’s settings to refuse new cookies, disable existing ones or simply let you know when new ones are sent to your hard disk. However, please be aware that, if you refuse or disable cookies, some of the website’s functionality may be lost. To learn more about how to refuse or disable cookies please visit “aboutcookies.org”.
HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION

You can tell when a third party is involved in a product or service you have requested because their name will appear with ours.
