Gushcloud will require your country of residence and like profile name and picture, it is visible to all Gushcloud users as a default. The reason being cloud posters will know whether you can be applicable and suitable to do a specific task with regards to your country.
Getting Verified
Verification is an important step to ensure that you are indeed an autonomous human being and not any form of harmful automated entity. Thus we need to authenticate you as person who has sign up for a particular account as Gushcloud involves transactions that are financial in nature. This process also helps us to ensure that there is no account duplication or duplicate accounts made by a particular individual. If a person is not verified, he cannot withdraw any funds or perform clouds with monetary rewards. In order to be verified, we will ask for your mobile number. We will send you an automatically generated pin on our end by SMS and confirm the mobile number. We will also ask for your country of residence, address and zip code for verification purposes also.
We will not use your address for any other purpose but verification only. Your address will be kept private and confidential, in which will not be shown to other people in any Gushcloud page.

Your Gushworth identifies how much influence you have in your social network, your network spread, how well you do a task and your authenticity in Gushcloud. The cloud posters will know to whom to prioritize and target for invites to the cloud. It also helps the cloud poster to identify spammers, frauds, authentic users and people who repeatedly do not do their task accordingly.

Cloud posting privacy
There are 4 types of privacy settings for clouds:
Open to everyone: Anyone can view and do this cloud.
Open to everyone: Anyone can do this cloud so long as the cloud has a similar tag to the searched tags.
Closed cloud: Only invited people can do this task and invited friends in the bonus task option will be able to see this cloud as well.

The funds available in your wallet will never be made public on your public profile by Gushcloud. However, your cloud activities will be made public. We strongly advise not to reveal your monetary transfers and funds residing in your wallet to protect your account and prevent unwanted and malicious attention.

However, the cloud poster will be unable to see who selected a particular answer in the poll results due to respect of anonymity and privacy of all Gushcloud users.

These efforts may on occasion result in a temporary or permanent suspension or termination of some functions for some users.
To supplement your profile.
We may use information about you that we collect from other Gushcloud, Twitter and Facebook users to supplement your profile (such as when you are tagged in a photo or mentioned in a status update). In such cases we generally give you the ability to remove the content (such as allowing you to remove a photo tag of you) or limit its visibility on your profile.
Downloadable Software.
Certain downloadable software applications and applets that we offer, such as our browser toolbars and photo uploaders, transmit data to us. We may not make a formal disclosure if we believe our collection of and use of the information is the obvious purpose of the application, such as the fact that we receive photos when you use our photo uploader.

The invitation may also contain information about other users your friend might know. We may also send up to two reminders to them in your name. We will only allow a non-Gushcloud account holder to receive such invites 2 times a week. We want to do our best to keep Gushcloud a spam free platform as much as possible.

You should protect yourself and block potential spammers, frauds, dual account holders, etc to safe guard your privacy and welfare. You can go the extra step to inform us of such people.

To provide you with services.
We may provide information to service providers that help us bring you the services we offer. For example, we may use third parties to help host our website, send out email updates about Gushcloud, remove repetitive information from our user lists, process payments, or provide search results or links. These service providers may have access to your personal information for use for a limited time, but when this occurs we implement reasonable contractual and technical protections to limit their use of that information to helping us provide the service.

Deactivating or deleting your account.
If you want to stop using your account you may deactivate it or delete it. When you deactivate an account, no user will be able to see it, but it will not be deleted. We save your profile information (connections, photos, etc.) in case you later decide to reactivate your account. Many users deactivate their accounts for temporary reasons and in doing so are asking us to maintain their information until they return to Gushcloud. You will still have the ability to reactivate your account and restore your profile in its entirety. When you delete an account, it is permanently deleted from Gushcloud. You should only delete your account if you are certain you never want to reactivate it.
Limitations on removal.
Even after you remove information from your profile or delete your account, copies of that information may remain viewable elsewhere to the extent it has been shared with others, it was otherwise distributed pursuant to your discoverability, or it was copied or stored by other users. However, your name will no longer be associated with that information on Gushcloud. (For example, if you post something to another user's profile and then you delete your account, that post may remain, but be attributed to an "Anonymous Gushcloud User.") Additionally, we may retain certain information to prevent identity theft and other misconduct even if deletion has been requested. If you have given third party applications or websites access to your information, they may retain your information to the extent permitted under their terms of service or privacy policies. But they will no longer be able to access the information through our Platform after you disconnect from them.
Backup copies.
Removed and deleted information may persist in backup copies for up to 90 days, but will not be available to others.
Non-user contact information.
If a user provides your email address to us, and you are not a Gushcloud user but you want us to delete your address. However, that request will only apply to addresses we have at the time of the request and not to any addresses that users provide to us later.
Steps we take to keep your information secure.
We do our best to keep your information secure, but we need your help.
We keep your account information on a secured server behind a firewall. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card numbers and passwords), we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We also use automated and social measures to enhance security, such as analyzing account behavior for fraudulent or otherwise anomalous behavior, may limit use of site features in response to possible signs of abuse, may remove inappropriate content or links to illegal content, and may suspend or disable accounts.
Risks inherent in sharing information.
Although we allow you to set privacy options that limit access to your information, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot control the actions of other users with whom you share your information. We cannot guarantee that only authorized persons will view your information. We cannot ensure that information you share on Gushcloud will not become publicly available. We are not responsible for third party circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures on Gushcloud. You can reduce these risks by using common sense security practices such as choosing a strong password, using different passwords for different services, and using up to date antivirus software.
