What personally identifiable information does Turtlediary collect from me?
Turtlediary collects information in several ways from different parts of our products.
Some personal information is gathered when you register. Depending on your account type, Turtlediary may ask for your name, e-mail address, and/or additional information. We may also ask you to choose a username and password. This information is used to activate additional features of the Website, to purchase products and to view secure content. In the event that you purchase a subscription, we ask for credit card data and other payment and billing information.
In addition to the information we collect when you register, we may ask you for personal information at other times, such as when you contact our technical support team.

How does Turtlediary use my information?
Turtlediary's goals in collecting personal information are to provide you and your child, the user, with a customized experience on our sites and a high level of technical support.
Turtlediary does research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior based on the information provided to us upon registration, from our server log files, or from surveys. We do this to better understand and serve our users; for instance, this information often gives us ideas for improving our products. This research is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis.
Who is collecting information?
When you are on the Turtlediary site and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information with Turtlediary alone, unless it is specifically stated otherwise. If data is being collected or maintained by any company other than Turtlediary, you will be notified prior to the time of the data collection or transfer.
As a general rule, Turtlediary will not disclose any of your personally identifiable information except when we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the law requires it or under the circumstances described below. The following describes some of the reasons that your information may be disclosed.
Business Partners & Sponsors. Turtlediary will never disclose your personal information to business partners or sponsors, unless it is specifically described to you prior to data collection or prior to transferring the data. If personally identifying data about you will be shared, we will tell you before we collect or transfer the data. If Turtlediary becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Third Party Data & Data in the Aggregate. Under confidentiality agreements, Turtlediary may match user information with third party data. Also, Turtlediary discloses aggregated user statistics (for example, 8% of our users are from California) in order to describe our services to current and prospective partners and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes.
Other. Turtlediary may release personal information if it has a good faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request; (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof; (c) detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; or (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property, or safety of Turtlediary, its users, or the public as required or permitted by law.
What are my choices regarding collection, use, and distribution of my information?

What security precautions are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of my information?
We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure, or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage, and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data. However, the internet is an open system and we cannot provide absolute assurances that transmissions or data cannot be intercepted or decrypted by others.
Your registered accounts are password-protected so that you and only you have access to any personal information you have entered in your account. You may edit your account information at any time by logging into your account and clicking the Account or Profile link.
For your protection, remember to log out of all accounts before closing your browser. There is a log out link available on most Turtlediary pages.

This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information if you share a computer with someone else or are using a public computer.
We restrict access to personal information to Turtlediary employees, contractors, and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop, or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.
How does Turtlediary protect children's privacy?
Turtlediary is committed to protecting the safety and wellbeing of children, and we continually work to ensure that our data collection practices conform to all applicable laws, including the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).
We are required by law to obtain parental consent in order to collect, use, or disclose Personal Information from Children who are under 13 years of age. Turtlediary does not ask a child under age 13 for more personal information, as a condition of participation, than is reasonably necessary to participate in a given activity. Such personal information may include the child's name and email address as gathered upon registration, messages that the child may post via message boards or chat rooms, email inquiries as well as information gathered passively via Cookies. Turtlediary does not gather information on the ages of our users and will never knowingly share personally identifying information about users who are under the age of 13 with business partners or other third parties.
A Parent has the right to review their Child's personal information, either by logging in to the Child's account profile or by contacting us directly. A Parent may update their child's personal information directly in the account profile. Additionally, a Parent may ask us to delete their child's personal data and close the account, which would further prohibit future collection or use of the child's personal information. Upon such request, we will delete the Child's account and all the information and data stored for such account to the extent possible. When we delete such data, it will be deleted from our active databases but may remain in our archives.
Turtlediary may (and the Parent authorizes us to) rely on the instructions that we reasonably believe are given by a Child's Parent. For example, if a person contacts our technical support and provides the requisite account information, we may assume that the person calling is the Child's Parent.
What else should I know about my privacy?
Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online (for example on message boards, through e-mail, or in chat areas) that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.
Some Turtlediary services offer the option to show your name and e-mail address in various capacities. If you decide to show your name and e-mail address, you are making it available to others over the Internet.
Additionally, some Turtlediary services offer the ability to build custom Web pages or customize the content on a Web page. Just like any other Web-page building tool, the pages thus created can be accessed by anyone over the Internet. Please do not include any information on your Web page that you do not want to disclose over the Internet. PLEASE BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL WHEN DISCLOSING ANY INFORMATION IN CHAT ROOMS, FORUMS AND OTHER PUBLIC POSTING AREAS. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE USE BY OTHERS OF THE INFORMATION THAT YOU DISCLOSE IN SUCH CHAT ROOMS, FORUMS OR OTHER PUBLIC POSTING AREAS.
