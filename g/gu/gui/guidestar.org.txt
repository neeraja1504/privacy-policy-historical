Do Not Track.
Every time your computer sends or receives information over the Web, the request begins with some short pieces of information called “headers.” These headers include information like what browser you are using, what language your computer is set to, and other details. The Do Not Track technology provides individual users with the ability to include a simple, machine-readable header indicating that they don't want to be tracked, and sends a signal to Websites visited requesting that the website disable either its tracking or cross-site user tracking of an individual user. To learn more about how DNT works, please visit http://allaboutdnt.com/.Currently, various browsers—including Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Safari—offer a “do not track” option. Presently, there is no consensus on how Do Not Track should be interpreted, and no common or accepted industry standard for implementing. Consequently, please note that our Website does not currently respond to browsers' Do Not Track signals, and as such your activities will be tracked, regardless of whether you have opted to enable the Do Not Track option offered by your browser.
