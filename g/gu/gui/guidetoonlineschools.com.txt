Introduction and Scope of this Privacy Policy
At Reach Network, we take online privacy seriously and we respect the concerns of our community of users. The following Privacy Policy governs the online information collection practices of GuidetoOnlineSchools.com (owned by Reach Network, Inc. DBA as SR Education Group). Specifically, it outlines the types of information that GuidetoOnlineSchools.com (the “Site”) gathers about you to help you make informed decisions about how information is used or shared when you visit or use the Site (the “Services”). It also describes the choices available to you regarding the use of, your access to, and how to update and correct your personal information.
Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By visiting the Site, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.
Because the Internet is an evolving medium, we may need to change our Privacy Policy at some point in the future. We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page prior to the change becoming effective so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
By continuing to use the Site after we post any such changes, you accept the Privacy Policy as modified.
What Information is Collected About Visitors?
The information that is collected about you while you are using the Service falls into two general categories:
1. Information You Provide to Us.
The Site may collect and store information, personal or otherwise, that you voluntarily supply while on the Site and/or use the Service. Specifically, but not exclusively, we collect personal information such as your name, address, phone number, email address, and other information relevant to particular products or services that you choose to enter into one of the Service's forms. We use this information to send you product updates, respond to customer service requests, and to administer your query. If you decline to supply or provide the Site with certain information while using the Service, you may not be able to use or participate in some or all of the features offered through the Service or by the Company. If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter(s), we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you. Out of respect for your privacy, you may choose to stop receiving our newsletter or marketing emails (see "Opt-Out Policy" below).
2. Log Files.
As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.
We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. We do this to improve services we offer you, as well as to improve analytics and site functionality.
3. Merging of Information.
Information collected through the Site may be merged with information collected from other sources, including offline sources such as modifications requested via phone or email in order to modify contact information. Similarly, information collected through the Site may be stored with information collected from other sources, including offline sources.
With Whom Will Your Information Be Shared?
We may share information about you with other people or unaffiliated companies or for various purposes including, without limitation, the purposes described below: (Except as stated in this policy, we do not sell your personal information to third parties). We may disclose your personal information to these third parties with your prior consent.
Products or Service Requests : If you submit a request for information about a product or service on the Site, we will share information about you contained in the request form with third-parties regarding whose products or services you seek information. Alternatively, we may directly fulfill your request for the information you seek. Third parties who provide products or services regarding which you seek information may contact you by telephone, e-mail, or postal mail based on the information you provided, even if you have opted into the National Do Not Call List administered by the Federal Trade Commission, any state equivalent Do Not Call List, or the Do Not Call List of a specific company. If one of our business partners contacts you and you wish not to be contacted again by that business partner with respect to your inquiry, then you should specifically make a request to that partner not to contact you again. In some cases, a third party may be involved in the process - for example, the Site may share your information with a third party who will fulfill your request on behalf of the third party regarding whose products or services you seek information.
Service Providers : We may disclose information about you to companies that provide certain services on behalf of the Site, such as marketing or distribution services. Our service providers use the information received via the Site for the purposes of providing you with the products or services you requested. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.
Related Companies : We may share information about you with subsidiaries, parent companies, entities otherwise controlled by us, with successors, and assigns, or in connection with a merger or sale of all or substantially all of our assets or equity, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.
Marketing Partners : We may also share information with marketing partners who may provide information (on their own behalf or on behalf of third parties) regarding products or services which may be of interest to you.
Required by Law : In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. We reserve the right to disclose your personal information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site.
You may opt-out of the above information sharing as set forth below (see "Opt-Out Policy" below).
In addition to the information that you provide to us or that we obtain about you, we may augment the data we collect with other information from other online or offline sources.

If you opt-out, we will not contact you after we have processed your opt-out request (up to 3 days) unless otherwise provided in this privacy policy. However, if we shared your information with third parties prior to the processing of your opt-out request, such third parties may continue to contact you. If you receive email correspondence from third parties, you should contact such third parties directly with respect to opting out of such third party communications.
