2. How Guidebook Uses Your Information
We acquire, hold, use, and Process Personal Information about Individuals for a variety of business purposes, including:
Guidebook Customers
We use your Personal Information to provide and improve the Services, process payments, complete your transactions, administer your inquiries, and contact you regarding account activities, new version and product offerings, or other communications relevant to the Services.
If you interact with End Users through a Guide, for example by sending notifications or other information to them, we keep records of such messaging on our servers and use it in the operation of the Services.
Your Guide may be accessible via search engines or similar services. You can keep your Guide private by adjusting your privacy settings.
You Content will be visible to any End Users who download the applicable Guide, and Guidebook does not control the use or dissemination of Content in such cases by End Users, Visitors, or any third party. You are solely responsible for obtaining the consent of any data subjects whose Personal Information might be reflected in a Guide you create using the Services.
End Users
We use Profile Information and Social information to populate a profile that is visible to other users of the Services. If you do not want other End Users to see this information, you should not input it into the Services. Guidebook cannot and does not control the actions taken by other End Users with information they can access through the Services.
We also share Usage Information and Personal Information about your use of a particular Guide with the Guidebook Customer who created the Guide. This may occur through the Guidebook App or a branded app, but in a branded app the Guidebook Customer may request additional Personal Information from you. You should consult that Guidebook Customer, its privacy policy, and or its support team for details about how they use such information. Guidebook Customers may use information, including Personal Information, to provide online advertising on a Guide and to facilitate transmittal of information that may be useful, relevant, valuable or otherwise of interest to you. Guidebook is not responsible for the privacy practices or policies of Guidebook Customers or the content of such advertisements. Guidebook does not restrict or control the use of Personal information about End Users by Guidebook Customers, who may share your information with, for example, event sponsors.
We use your location, if available, to tailor the Services to you and offer you more relevant information about your Guide, event, location, or other nearby users.
We use information about your interactions with other End Users or Guide authors to operate and improve the services, deliver communications between you, and/or notify you that you have relevant information available to you to review within the Guide or Guidebook App.
We use your Personal Information to communicate relevant information to you about the Services, your Guide, or the Guidebook App via email, to authenticate your access to the account (including by using Social Logins to authenticate your login to our own Guidebook App).
It is possible that, because of the nature of the Guide you download using the Guidebook App or otherwise, certain potentially-sensitive information about you may be logged on our systems – for example: you download a guide relating to transgender advocacy or diabetes treatment.
End Users can send a request to privacy@guidebook.com to request that their Personal Information be deleted from our systems and not further shared with Guidebook Customers or other third parties. Note that this may require that you delete your Guidebook account and/or cease using one or more Guides.

Please note that we do not respond to or honor DNT signals or similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers.
6. Cookies and Interest-Based Advertising
As noted above, you may stop or restrict the placement of cookies on your computer or remove them from your browser by adjusting your web browser preferences. Please note that cookie-based opt-outs are not effective on mobile applications. However, on many mobile devices, application users may opt out of certain mobile ads via their device settings.
The online advertising industry also provides websites from which you may opt out of receiving targeted ads from our data partners and our other advertising partners that participate in self-regulatory programs. You can access these, and also learn more about targeted advertising and consumer choice and privacy, at www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp, or http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/ and www.aboutads.info/choices/. You can also choose not to be included in Google Analytics here.
To be clear, whether you are using our opt-out or an online industry opt-out, these cookie-based opt-outs must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted-out. For example, if you have opted-out on your computer browser, that opt-out will not be effective on your mobile device. You must separately opt out on each device. Advertisements on Third-Party websites that contain the AdChoices link and that link to this Privacy Policy may have been directed to you based on anonymous, non-Personal Information collected by advertising partners over time and across websites. These advertisements provide a mechanism to opt out of the advertising partners’ use of this information for interest-based advertising purposes.
7. Rights of Access, Rectification, Erasure, and Restriction
Under Privacy Shield, you may inquire as to whether Guidebook is Processing Personal Information about you, request access to Personal Information, and ask that we correct, amend or delete your Personal Information where it is inaccurate or has been Processed in violation of the Privacy Shield Principles.
EU and Swiss residents have the right to access personal data about them and to request the correction, amendment, removal or limitation of the use and disclosure of their personal data processed by Guidebook. Such requests should be sent by email to privacy@guidebook.com or by regular mail to:
Guidebook Inc .
Attn: Security Department
340 Bryant Street, Suite 400

Please include your full name, email address associated with your account, and a detailed description of your data request. Such requests will be processed in line with local laws.
Although Guidebook makes good faith efforts to provide Individuals with access to their Personal Information, there may be circumstances in which Guidebook is unable to provide access, including but not limited to: where the information contains legal privilege, would compromise others’ privacy or other legitimate rights, where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the Individual’s privacy in the case in question or where it is commercially proprietary. If Guidebook determines that access should be restricted in any particular instance, we will provide you with an explanation of why that determination has been made and a contact point for any further inquiries. To protect your privacy, Guidebook will take commercially reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access to or making any changes to your Personal Information.
8. Data Retention
Guidebook retains the Personal Information we receive as described in this Privacy Policy for as long as you use our Services or as necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected, provide our Services, resolve disputes, establish legal defenses, conduct audits, pursue legitimate business purposes, enforce our agreements, and comply with applicable laws.
9. Security of Your Information
Guidebook is very concerned with safeguarding your information. We employ commercially reasonable administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access. Unfortunately, no transmission of information over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you provide to us. We do not accept liability for unintentional disclosure. We encrypt transmissions through our Services, including transmission of Personal Information, with Transport Layer Security (TLS), a cryptographic protocol recognized in the software industry as a reasonable secure method of internet transmission. In addition, our cloud service providers implement industry standard security measures to protect your Personal Information when in storage and/or at rest.
Your Payment Information, subject to any changes to our third party payment processor’s operations, is secured according the Payment Card industry Data Security Standards, Level 1.
Our employees are provided with context-specific access to our systems and your Personal Information, and are subject to contractual obligations to access and use your Personal Information only as required to deliver Services to you.
While our Services use cloud infrastructure, our cloud provider places technical and procedural safeguards in place to limit their access to any of our business information, including your Personal Information.
Any changes to the treatment of Personal Information are reviewed and approved by Guidebook management.
A note regarding storage. We use cloud storage providers to operate the Services.
