Our Privacy Promise and Policy
At guitarguitar, we believe in being open and transparent with our customers, so we have developed a Privacy Promise. This is a quick and simple summary of how we manage, share and store your information.
We promise to tell you how we use your data and that we will use it to keep your shopping experience as smooth and as simple as possible. Plus, we will make sure we collect and store your data securely.
Why we need a little information
To allow you to enjoy your purchase, we sometimes have to collect and keep a small amount of data, including your name, contact details, address, email address and payment details. We also have to share your data with organisations when necessary, including, but not limited to, our couriers, suppliers, repair technicians, payment providers, and finance providers. On occasion, we may additionally be required to share your details with local councils and authorities.
If we need your details, we promise to collect, process, store, and share your data safely and securely. We will also expect other businesses we work with to be just as careful with your data and not to use it for purposes you have not authorised. We will never hold onto your data for longer than is required and we will never sell your data to any 3rd party.
We will use data to make your purchase quick and easy
We will use the personal details that you share with us to let you know when online orders will be delivered, when in-store orders have arrived, for resolving issues regarding your order, for improving the processing of any servicing or warranties, for purchase preferences, for e-receipts, for audit and statistical analysis, and for other matters relating to the goods you have purchased. We may also ask for feedback on your purchase using our partners Feefo and Trustpilot if you have provided an email address.
If you have agreed separately, we may use your data to tell you about events and promotions
If you choose to receive marketing from guitarguitar, we can let you know when items are on sale, when there are special offers, or to tell you about new products and services we think might be of interest to you.
You’re in control of your data
If you would like to stop receiving non-essential communications from us, you can amend your preferences at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link contained within email communications.
