2.2 Analytics Information
We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Website. These tools collect information sent by your device, including the web pages you visit, add-ons, and other information that assists us in improving the Website. We collect and use this analytics information with analytics information from other visitors so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify any particular individual visitor of the Website.
2.3 Cookies and similar technologies
The Website contains “cookies”, clear gifs (also known as “web beacons” and “web bugs”), or similar technology. A cookie is a piece of data that is sent to your Internet browser, which will store the cookie on your computer if your browser is enabled to accept cookies. Web beacons assist in the delivery of cookies and the collection of non-personally identifiable information, such as “click path” and other data as described above.
The Website uses cookies, clear gifs, frames, server log analysis and other technologies as they are developed to customize your experience with the Website. We use them to:
(a) remember information about you so you do not have to keep giving it to us;
(b) help us understand how you and other visitors are using the Website;
(c) help us personalize the Website for you by remembering your preferences and settings; and
(d) find out if our emails have been read and if you have clicked a link in it.

To manage the Information being collected, you can access the “Settings” in your browser and adjust the “Cookies” settings to:
(a) erase cookies from your computer hard drive;
(b) block acceptance of all or some cookies; or
(c) receive a warning before a cookie is stored.
Please note, however, that if you block cookies, some portions of the Website may not function properly.
2.4 Log file information
Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you make a request to access (i.e., visit) a web page or app. It can also be provided when the content of the web page or app is downloaded to your browser or device.
When you use the Website, our servers automatically record certain log file information, including your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, referring/exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Website, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. We may also collect similar information from emails sent to our Mailing List Subscribers which then helps us track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Website.

When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access the Website, we may access, collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more “device identifiers.” Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device that uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by us.
A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third-party partner about how you browse and use the Website and may help us or others provide reports or personalized Content and ads. Some features of the Website may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.

Generally, we collect and use Information for the following purposes:
(a) to remember information so that you do not have to re-enter it each time you use the Website;
