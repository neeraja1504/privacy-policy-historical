The Guttmacher Institute (the “Institute”) is committed to protecting your privacy online. Your use of www.guttmacher.org (the “Website”) indicates your acceptance of this Privacy Policy (the “Policy”). If you do not accept all of the terms of the Policy you should not use the Website. This Policy may change, so please refer back to it periodically.
COLLECTION OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION
We may collect Personally Identifying Information from you only if it is specifically and knowingly provided by you. “Personally Identifying Information” is information that would allow someone to identify or contact you, including, for example, your name, organization, address, phone number, and e-mail address.
You are not required to provide Personally Identifying Information to visit the Website. If you choose not to provide Personally Identifying Information when prompted, you can still visit most of the Website pages.
USE OF INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE
Personally Identifying Information collected will be used to provide you with information and services, to enable you to participate in features on the Website, to contact you regarding updates about the Website, to provide customer support, and for other purposes described at the point of collection (for example, purchase transactions, requests for printed materials, electronic mailing list sign-up, and requests for download permission for selected online content).
If law enforcement or judicial authorities require us to provide them with your Personally Identifying Information, we must cooperate with the authorities if their request is supported with the necessary legal documentation.
In the event you make a donation, you grant us permission to access your credit card information. The Institute will use the information you provide for the transaction to complete your donation and to provide you with tools to manage and monitor your transactions. The Institute will not share, rent, or sell this donation-related information to any third parties without your consent, except that your credit card and other personal information will be shared with our credit card processor and then only to process the transaction.
Personally Identifying Information may also be used to gather broad demographic information about our user community or to perform analyses of user behavior in order to measure visitor interest in specific areas of the Website.
DONOR PRIVACY
The Institute at times exchanges the names and mailing addresses of donors who live in the United States with other nonprofit organizations working on similar issues. This type of exchange provides us with a cost-effective and reliable way to acquire new donors to support our work. If you would like to opt-out of our exchange program you may email us at donation@guttmacher.org or call 800-355-0244. View our donor privacy policy.
