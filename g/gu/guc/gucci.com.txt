This website is provided and managed by Gucci America, Inc.
Gucci recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of personal and financial information. We have instituted reasonable policies and security measures to protect the information you provide to us. When you register online with Gucci, use our online store, or choose to fill out and submit one of our customer information cards when visiting a Gucci store, you give us your consent to process and use such submitted personal data in accordance with this privacy policy.
This privacy policy applies to all protected personal information collected, maintained or used by Gucci. “Gucci” means Gucci America, Inc. and Guccio Gucci S.P.A. (Florence, Via Tornabuoni 73/r - Italy), which is the ultimate data controller. Gucci is an affiliate of the Kering Group.
What Information Gucci Collects
Gucci collects some protected personal information (e.g. name, address, telephone number(s), email address, etc.) from visitors to its website who register their information or who use the online store. We also use cookies (as described below) and track IP addresses so that we can improve our services and enhance your Gucci experience. In addition, Gucci collects some protected personal information from our customers who submit a customer information card at one of our stores, from our affiliated companies and, on occasion, from online or offline third party sources. We may use any such personal information about our customers and prospective customers in order to better serve you and to enhance the promotional offerings, tailored advertisements and communications you receive.
Gucci does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of thirteen. If you are under thirteen, please ask your parents to register and/or use the online store.
How Gucci Uses Information You Provide
The data that you choose to provide to us at one of our stores or online, and the data that we may collect, is used by Gucci to keep you informed of our special events or promotions, to register you with our website, to administer our website services, and/or to process any orders you may place online. Otherwise, we may use the information you provide to us only to review our performance and to improve our services to you, or to communicate with you about your order if you have placed an online order.
Gucci maintains customer data for purposes of customer relationship management, marketing research, analysis and promotion. By either giving the appropriate consent on our website or by submitting your email address on a customer information card, you agree that Gucci may send you announcements on products or promotions, tailored advertisements that may be of particular interest to you, and invitations to Gucci’s events based on your purchase profile.
If you provide incomplete or inaccurate data, Gucci may be unable to inform you of specific promotions or events and to provide you with our services.
Does Gucci Share Your Information With Others?
Gucci does not sell, rent or, except as described below, disclose our client's names, addresses, email addresses or other personal information to any non-Kering Group entity. Gucci may share customer information within Kering Group, so that you may be informed of other products that may be of interest to you.
Your data will be held in our secured electronic Worldwide Gucci Customer Database which may be accessed by other companies within the Kering Group throughout the world and by selected third-party service providers acting on Gucci’s behalf.
In order to maintain our website, to manage our database, and to distribute and provide promotional materials and other communications to clients or potential clients, Gucci contracts with selected third parties. As necessary, the personal information you provide to us may be processed by these third parties, solely on Gucci’s behalf but we do not authorize any of these service providers to make any other use of your information.
Gucci does not otherwise disclose your information to third parties, unless we are required to do so by law or in connection with a legal claim or proceeding. If Gucci is acquired by another entity or is merged or consolidated, information about Gucci customers may be made available to the new entity. However, the new entity will agree to protect the confidentiality of your personal information consistent with this Privacy Policy.
Security
Gucci uses appropriate security measures to protect the information you provide to us. However, while we take reasonable steps to protect this personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure, you accept that no Internet data transmission can be guaranteed to be secure from access by unintended recipients and will not hold us responsible for any breach of security unless this breach is due to our negligence.
