Privacy Policy | GunBroker.com
As used in this Privacy Policy, “personal information” means information that may be used to identify a specific individual, or that is about an identifiable individual, including but not limited to name, email address, phone number or credit card number.  “Aggregate information” refers to combined demographic information which has been derived from personal information but which cannot be reasonably used to identify any individual.
** ** I. Information We Collect On the Site and How We Use It
You can visit our Web Site and learn about the services we provide without providing personal information.  You do need to provide personal information, however, to sell, bid on or purchase items, and to participate in our user forums and other interactive portions of the Site.   Certain non-personally identifiable information, such as IP address, is collected automatically from every Site visitor, even if not voluntarily provided, as discussed further below.
We collect and use personal information in the specific ways listed below, and generally to improve our Site and services to you, as well as to meet our legal obligations.  We also use personal information you provide for other purposes consistent with the reason you provide such information to us.
1.   Registration and Site Activity Information.  The Site’s registration process requires users to provide us valid and accurate contact information including name, billing address, mobile phone number, birth date and email address (collectively, “Registration Information”).
We may verify your registration information through third-party identity verification service providers we use to assist us. This is done as an identity verification and fraud prevention measure.
One type of identity verification service is called “credit header” information. You may be required to answer a multiple-choice questionnaire compiled from information managed by consumer and business information sources. These questions can include elements from your financial history. We do not collect or store any personal information from the “credit header” process. All we receive is an indication of how many questions you answered successfully.
Another type of identity verification service we have uses your mobile phone Subscriber Data from your mobile carrier (AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, US Cellular, Verizon, or any other branded wireless carrier) to verify your identity. Your mobile phone Subscriber Data may include, without limitation, name, date of birth, postal address, billing zip code, telephone numbers, electronic mail addresses, credit card numbers, Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI), location information, handset and mobile device identifiers (International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) and International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI)) and other status details, if available, account information and credit information.
Pre-Fill Form Option: Identity verification using your mobile phone Subscriber Data includes a Pre-Fill Form Option for us to use to expedite verifying your identity. The Pre-Fill Form includes information verified by our mobile phone identify verification service provider. The Pre-Fill Form Option requires you to answer a question by submitting your mobile phone billing zip code. It also requires you to provide us your express opt-in consent by clicking on the “OK” button on the consent page.
You authorize your wireless operator to disclose your mobile number, name, address, email, network status, customer type, customer role, billing type, mobile device identifiers (IMSI and IMEI) and other subscriber details, if available, to GunBroker.com and service providers for the duration of the business relationship, solely for identity verification and fraud avoidance.
We collect certain information submitted during transactions on the Site based on your activities, including all purchases, as well as shipping and billing information, and other information you provide in connection with buying or shipping an item (collectively, “Transaction Information”). We may also collect certain personal information that you provide through message board discussions, chats, correspondence or dispute resolution.
Registration Information, Site Activity Information  and other personal information that you provide may be used in the following ways:
For fraud protection at the time of registration;
To send you transaction-related notifications about transactions you carry out on the Site;
If and when you bid on an item, to share your name, address, telephone number, email address and bid information with the seller to facilitate the transaction;
If and when you list an item for sale, to share your contact information, including name, address, email address, telephone number and item detail with bidders to facilitate the transaction;
To perform our billing, administration and collections functions (and to contact you when necessary about these functions);
To report information about your account, including late payments, missed payments or other delinquencies or defaults on your accounts, to credit reporting bureaus;
To better understand your interests and for other marketing-related initiatives;
To communicate with you and carry out actions requested by you (such as subscriptions to newsletters), including promotional messages (some of which may be related to your transactions on the Site); and
When facilitating the investigation of fraud or illegal activity, to share information with law enforcement or other governmental agencies or authorized third parties when requested pursuant to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity or any other activity that may expose you, us or another Site user to legal liability.
Please see “Communications From the Site and Your Choices” below for information on controlling communications from us.
2.    Financial Information .   If you list items on the Site, we collect financial information including bank account and/or credit card number, expiration date, card security code and billing address.  As noted under “Registration and Site Activity Information” above, we also collect credit card information from those who register using an email address from a free email provider such as Yahoo!™ Mail or Hotmail™ or Google’s Gmail.  Financial information is used to bill you for transactions you carry out on the Site and to collect on fees and debts incurred through the use of the Site.  If your account is past due and collection must be pursued, your contact and financial information may be shared with collection agents and/or credit reporting agencies.  We share financial information with non-affiliated third parties to facilitate the completion of transactions on the Site as specified above, to respond to subpoenas, for other legal compliance purposes, and for billing and collections.
3.    Contests and Surveys.  If you decide to enter contests or surveys featured from time to time on the Site, you may be asked for personal information in addition to your Registration Information.  This information is used in order to administer the contest or survey (for example, to contact the winner) or as otherwise disclosed on the Site at the time we collect the information.
4.    Information Requests.  We may ask you to provide personal information in order to allow us to respond to your requests for information or other requests made over the Site.
5.   Social Media.  We may collect your user name and other information you transmit to us over social media platforms such as Facebook® or Twitter® when you interact with GunBroker.com’s specific page or social media account.  We use the information you provide on social media to respond to your requests or questions, to improve our services, and for other purposes as disclosed at the time of the interaction.
6.   Emails from GunBroker.com.  Most email messages generated by the Site result directly from the user’s actions (such as registration information, confirmation of placing a bid, confirmation of listing an item, or the user’s choice to subscribe to certain communications), or as necessary to inform you of changes to the Site or events related to the Site, or changes to the Site rules or policies. Other e-mail messages may result from marketing initiatives on the Site; however, users may opt-out of receiving marketing messages; see the section below entitled “Communications from the Site and Your Choices.”
Emails from our Site may contain web beacons or “clear .gifs.”  These are small graphic images that can be used for recording when an email has been opened in order to track the performance of email marketing campaigns.  We and our third party service providers currently log responses from web beacons, but this information is not stored or linked to your personal information in our systems.
7.    Non-personal information.  We automatically collect your IP address when you visit our Site.  We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Site. Your IP address is used to gather broad demographic information, and to track usage patterns in the Site. We also may collect geo-location information, device identification number and type, computer and connection information, statistics about page views and standard web log information.   We do not correlate this information with data about individual users (though our third-party analytics companies and/or advertisers may do so – see below under “Website Analytics” and “Banner Advertising” for your choices in this regard).
8.  _  Cookies_.  We or our third party advertisers or service providers may use a technology referred to as “cookies” (or other similar technology), which are pieces of data on your computer tied to information about you.

9.    General Uses .   In addition to the foregoing, we will use your personal information as specifically described on the Site at the time of collection (for example, to share with a charity in the case of your participation in a charity auction).  We may also use your information internally to customize your experience with our company and our Site (for example, adapting the Site to your browser), to help us develop new products and services, to verify your identity, to collect debts or fees owed to us, or to investigate or settle inquiries or disputes, and for other legally required or permissible purposes.
10. Website Analytics .
