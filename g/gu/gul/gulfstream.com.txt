Automatically through logging and analytics tools, cookies, and as a result of your use of and access to the Services; and
From third-party sources, including from app stores, which includes service providers such as payment processors, aircraft maintenance providers, and analytics providers, and through your interactions with us on social media websites.

In certain situations, we may also require you to provide personal data to authenticate your identity in order to carry out your requests.
We also collect information from you that, depending on applicable law, may not constitute personal data.
Information Collected Automatically: When you browse or use the Services, we utilize commonly used logging and analytics tools, including Google Analytics and for our mobile applications, AppSee, to collect information about your device, the network used to access the Services, and information about your use of the Services (such as how you navigate and move around the Services).
We also use certain technologies on the Services, including cookies and pixel tags, that allow us, our service providers, and other third parties to store information locally on your device, identify your device, track your interactions with other sites or with our email campaigns, and track activity over time and across websites.
Information collected automatically includes the software and hardware attributes of the device you use to access the Services, unique device ID information, regional and language settings, performance data about the Services, network provider, and the IP address (a number assigned to your device when you use the internet). In addition, information is collected passively in the form of log files and third-party analytics that record activity on websites and mobile applications.

Location Information: If you permit certain Services (such as our mobile applications) to access information about your location (including Global Positioning System ( "GPS" ) or general location information derived from the network you use to access the Services), we collect the precise or general location information provided by your device for the purposes listed in the Addenda for those Services. See the "YOUR CHOICES" section below for more information about how to disable or limit the collection of GPS data.
Cookies, Web Tracking, and Advertising: We use cookies and pixel tags to personalize and enhance your experience in regard to our Services, to collect data about your visit to our Services, to help diagnose problems with our servers, to administer the Services, to evaluate the effectiveness of our marketing and advertising campaigns, to permit analytics providers to gather information about your visit to the Services, and to gather broad demographic information about our users.

4. HOW DO WE PROCESS PERSONAL DATA?
We process personal data for two general purposes, pursuant to various legal bases, including:
For our business operations (including communicating with you, fulfilling orders, providing information about our products and services, improving the Services, and complying with applicable legal requirements); and
To market and promote our, and our partners’, products and offerings.
We disclose personal data to our service providers to allow them to provide services to us and assist in carrying out your requests.
In addition, we may disclose information we maintain, including personal data, when permitted or required to do so by law, in response to a request from a law enforcement agency or authority or any regulatory authority, and/or to protect the integrity of the Services or our interests, rights, property, or safety, and/or that of our users and others.
Please see the "YOUR CHOICES" section below for information about how you can make decisions about how we process personal data, including how to opt out of certain marketing communications.
Legal Bases for Processing: We process personal data for, or based on, one or more of the following legal bases:
Performance of a Contract: We may use personal data to enter into, or perform under, the agreement between us, including processing payment and billing information as part of a purchase or sale, to conduct due diligence on customers and potential customers, and providing customer service and support.
Legitimate Interests: We may use personal data for our legitimate interests, including improving service; providing information about our products and/or services; to the extent necessary and proportionate for the purposes of ensuring the security of our premises, network, and information; and for administrative, fraud detection, and legal compliance purposes.
Compliance with Legal Obligations and Protection of Individuals: We may use personal data to comply with the law and our legal obligations, as well as to protect you and other individuals from certain harms.
Your Consent: We process certain personal data because you have given us your consent to process it in that manner.
Operational Uses: We process your personal data as part of our operations, which include:
Providing you with information tailored to your requests, responding to inquiries, and delivering services and products;
Operating, maintaining, and improving the quality of the Services and such content, products, and/or services as we may make available through the Services;
Communicating with you by email, mail, telephone, push notification, and other methods of communication, in each case with your consent, if such consent is required in accordance with applicable laws, about products, services, order status, and other topics;
Compliance with applicable laws, regulations, rules, and requests of relevant law enforcement and/or other governmental agencies;
Endeavoring to protect our and our partners’ rights, property, or safety, and the rights, property, and safety of our users and other third parties; and
For other purposes, as permitted or required by law.
Marketing Uses: We process your personal data to send messages to you about us, our partners, and the products and services we and our partners offer, which may from time to time include contests, rewards, events, and special offers for products and services. These communications are tailored based on the communications preferences you select when providing us with your information and will only occur with your prior consent, if such consent is required in accordance with applicable laws. We process personal data collected through social media platforms and web tracking technologies to market to and understand our audience.
Sharing of Personal Data: Some of the above processing involves sharing collected personal data with third parties, including service providers, affiliates, and other partners.
We share personal data with third parties when you ask us to do so;
We share personal data among our affiliated entities;
We share personal data with our service providers, including those that provide aircraft support services such as maintenance and scheduling, payment processors, software and Web developers, customer relations management (CRM) services, communications services, order processing and fulfillment services, commercial mail/email providers, security consultants, data hosting services, and other vendors we engage so that they may provide services to you, to us, or on our behalf; and
We share personal data with third parties when we believe it is required by, or necessary to comply with, applicable law.
5. PROTECTING PERSONAL DATA
We employ reasonable and appropriate physical, technical, and organizational safeguards designed to promote the security of our systems and protect the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of personal data. Those safeguards include: (i) the pseudonymization and encryption of personal data where we deem appropriate; (ii) taking steps to ensure personal data is backed-up and remains available in the event of a security incident; and (iii) periodic testing, assessment, and evaluation of the effectiveness of our safeguards.
However, no method of safeguarding information is completely secure. While we use measures designed to protect personal data, we cannot guarantee that our safeguards will be effective or sufficient. In addition, you should be aware that internet data transmission is not always secure, and we cannot warrant that the information you transmit utilizing the Services is or will be secure.
6. RETENTION OF PERSONAL DATA
We retain personal data for a period of time depending on the type and sensitivity of the personal data, the purpose for which it is processed, and to the extent we deem necessary to carry out the processing activities described above, including, but not limited to, compliance with applicable laws, regulations, rules and requests of relevant law enforcement and/or other governmental agencies, and to the extent we reasonably deem necessary to protect our and our partners’ rights, property, or safety and the rights, property, and safety of our users and other third parties. We consider multiple factors, including legal requirements, the scope and nature of the personal data, and potential risk of harm to data subjects from a data breach, in determining the appropriate retention period.
For example, we generally retain personal data about our customers for the duration of the customer relationship plus a number of years afterwards. That process depends on the sensitivity of the information and the purpose for which it is processed. For example, personal data processed for the purposes of ensuring security of Gulfstream facilities during customer visits is held for a shorter period of time than personal data processed as part of customer service or sales contract activities.
If you have a specific question regarding retention of your personal data, you may contact us as described in the "Additional Information and Assistance" section below.
