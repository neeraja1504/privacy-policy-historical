As do most Internet retailers, we use other service providers (such as courier services) to perform specific functions on our behalf.

All information gathered by Gulmohar Lane is stored securely within a controlled database.

And, of course, any information you include in a posting to the discussion areas or on your social media profiles is available to anyone with Internet access. Any information that you share with your friends and others under our 'share with your friend' feature or ‘Share your private showcase’ is at your risk.
