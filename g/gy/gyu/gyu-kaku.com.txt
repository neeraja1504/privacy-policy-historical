Information Collected Via Technology – Do We Use “Cookies”?  As you use the Gyu-Kaku Site, certain information may be passively collected and stored on our service providers’ server logs, including your device information (e.g., Internet protocol address, browser type, device settings, and operating system) and usage information (e.g., the Gyu-Kaku Site you use, the time and duration of your use of the Gyu-Kaku Site, and other information about your interaction with content offered through the Gyu-Kaku Site). We also use cookies and navigational data, like Uniform Resource Locators (“URLs”), to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the solutions and information for which you searched and viewed, or on which of the advertisements displayed on the Gyu-Kaku Site you clicked. An Internet protocol address, or “IP Address,” is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. In some cases your IP Address stays the same from browser session to browser session; but if you use a consumer internet access provider, your IP Address probably varies from session to session. “Cookies” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing the Gyu-Kaku Site. They are used to help us understand your preferences based on previous or current Gyu-Kaku Site activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services. We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about Gyu-Kaku Site traffic and Gyu-Kaku Site interaction so that we can offer better Gyu-Kaku Site experiences and tools in the future. You can manage your cookie preferences via your browser settings; however, if you choose to disable this function, your experience at the Gyu-Kaku Site may be diminished and some features may not work as they were intended.

This may also include information about your precise location if you have enabled location-based services on your mobile device. We may also receive information about your device and may access your camera, microphone, or other device services or hardware. Some devices may allow you to opt-out of this collection or access, and in those cases, you may be able to subsequently stop the collection or access. Please review your device settings for more information.
Information from Third Party Sources.  We may receive information about you from publicly and commercially available third party sources, as permitted by law, which we may combine with other information we receive from or about you. For example, we may receive information about you from a social media site if you connect to the Gyu-Kaku Site from that social media site.
Other Information We Collect.  We also may collect other information about you, your device, or your use of the Gyu-Kaku Site in ways that we describe to you at the point of collection or otherwise with your consent.​
Third Party Access to Your Information.  Although you are entering into an agreement to disclose your information to us pursuant to this Policy, we do use third party individuals and organizations to assist us, including contractors, web hosts, app developers, and others. Throughout the course of our provision of the Gyu-Kaku Site to you, we may delegate our authority to collect, access, use, and disseminate your information. For example, our web host stores the information that you provide us, and we may hire outside contractors to perform maintenance or assist us in securing our website, or, our online and mobile interface provider develops and hosts a mobile application for us. It is therefore necessary that you grant the third parties we may use in the course of our business the same rights that you afford us under this Policy. For this reason, you hereby agree that every authorization that you grant to us in this Policy, you also grant to any third party that we may hire, contract, or otherwise retain the services of for the purpose of operating, maintaining, repairing, or otherwise improving or preserving the Gyu-Kaku Site or its underlying files or systems.

THIRD PARTY USE AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION.  Except as otherwise stated in this Policy, we do not sell, trade, rent, or otherwise share for marketing purposes the personal information that we collect with third parties, unless you ask or authorize us to do so.
However, we may provide your personal information to third party service providers or affiliates to perform business functions on our behalf or in conjunction with us. For example, we may use third parties to help us make our products, goods, and services available to you, fulfill orders you may have placed, process credit card payments, provide customer service, ship postal mail and packages, deliver your mail and packages, conduct market research or information analysis, manage promotions and sweepstakes, and contact you in connection with the Gyu-Kaku Site. We limit information provided to the aforementioned affiliate and third party service providers to the extent necessary for them to provide the services and require such service providers to promise not to use such information except as necessary to provide the relevant services to us. In these instances, we may need to provide your information to these third parties for such purposes.
Additionally, in the event we go through a business transition such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your personal information may be among the assets transferred. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur and are permitted by this Policy, and that any acquirer of ours or that acquirer’s assets may continue to process your personal information as set forth in this Policy.

SECURITY.  We are committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of industry-standard security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. Even though we have taken significant steps to protect your personal information, no company, including us, can fully eliminate security risks associated with personal information. The Gyu-Kaku Site has security measures in place to prevent the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information that we obtain from you. Please keep in mind, however, that whenever you give out personal information online there is a risk that third parties may intercept and use that information.
