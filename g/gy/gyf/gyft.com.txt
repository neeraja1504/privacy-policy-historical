Privacy - Gyft
Last Revised:  September 4, 2014
Gyft, Inc., is a subsidiary of First Data Corporation and is referred to in this privacy policy (“Policy”) as “Gyft”, “we”, “our”, or “us”.  This Policy explains how personally identifiable information is collected, used and disclosed by Gyft with respect to your access and use of our mobile application (“App”), the Gyft websites located at https://gyft.com  and app.gyft.com (collectively, the “Sites”) and Gyft’s online products and services provided therein (collectively with the App and Sites, the “Service”), so that you can make an informed decision about using the Service.  For the avoidance of doubt, the collection, use and disclosure of information by merchants that issue and redeem gift cards using the Service are governed by the privacy policies of those merchants.
We reserve the right to change the provisions of this Policy at any time. We will alert you that changes have been made by indicating on this Policy the date it was last updated and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as by adding a statement to the homepage of our App and/or Sites or by sending you an email notification). We encourage you to review this Policy from time-to-time to make sure that you understand how any personally identifiable information you provide to us or collected about you will be used.
What Is Personally Identifiable Information?
As used in this Policy, the term “personally identifiable information” means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, user name or email address), or information about that individual that is directly linked to information that specifically identifies an individual. Personally identifiable information does not include “aggregate” information, which is data we collect about the aggregate use of the Service or about a group or category of services or users, or data that has been reasonably de-identified and from which individual identities or other personally identifiable information has reasonably been removed. This Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate or de-identified information.
What Information Do We Collect?
Active Collection : We collect information from you in various ways when you use the Service. For example, we collect information that you voluntarily provide to us (such as when you send us an email or create a Gyft account). Such information may include personally identifiable information, such as your name, email address, social network data, other account data, and financial information. Personal and demographic information may also be collected if you provide such information in connection with posting data, providing access to your online groups and other activities in connection with the Service.

For example, we may automatically collect certain information such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address (which we may use to estimate your approximate location), unique device identifiers, your mobile number, your device model and name, your operating system, your browser type, your preferred language, and your activity on the Service. We may also automatically collect certain logistical information in server logs, including information about how you use various features of our Service and information about the number, frequency and length of each session. We treat this information as personally identifiable information if we combine it with or link it to any of the identifying information mentioned above. Otherwise, this information is used in aggregate or de-identified form only.
In connection with our App, we may collect information about the precise geolocation of your device with your consent.
