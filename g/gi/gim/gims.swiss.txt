We only transmit your data if you have expressly consented to this, if we are required to do so by law, or where we must do so in order to exercise our rights. We also transmit your data to our affiliates.
Furthermore, we transmit users’ personal data to third parties to the extent necessary for the use of the website and in order to answer questions, handle requests for information or, as applicable, provide the services requested by the user. Third-party use of data transmitted to this end is strictly limited to the purposes mentioned above, subject to the following clauses on use of data for marketing purposes.
Use for marketing purposes
Newsletter and other marketing campaigns By signing up for the newsletter, you expressly agree that we can use your address and your personal data for marketing purposes, such as sending newsletters about GIMS, invitations to the event and satisfaction surveys. You can unsubscribe from all marketing campaigns at any time. You will find the relevant contact details below, under “Contact”. There is also an unsubscribe link in all newsletter emails.
Furthermore, we are authorised to entrust the technical development of marketing campaigns to third parties and thus have the right to make your personal data available to third parties to that end.
Each time a newsletter is sent out, information is generated about the address file used, the subject, and the number of newsletters sent. We can also see which addresses have not yet received the newsletter, which address it was sent to and for which addresses sending failed. In addition to that, we can see the opening rate, including information about the addresses that opened the newsletter and clicked on the various links and/or made a purchase (tracking pixels). Finally, we can see information about the addresses that have unsubscribed. We use this data for statistical purposes and with a view to optimising the newsletter’s content and structure.
Transmission of personal data abroad
GIMS has the right to transmit your data to third-party companies abroad to the extent necessary for handling your requests for information, providing services and conducting marketing campaigns. These third-party companies are required to respect users’ privacy in the same way as the provider itself.
Right to information, deletion and correction
You may request information about the personal data concerning you and stored by us at any time. Requests for information must be submitted in writing and must be accompanied by proof of identity. Similarly, you have the right to demand the deletion or correction of the personal data concerning you and stored by us at any time.
You can exercise this right by emailing dpo@palexpo.ch. Other contact options are outlined below.
Please note that by law, certain data must be retained for a specific period. We are therefore required to store such data until that period has ended. We set these data apart in our system and only use them to comply with the relevant legal provisions.

The website of GIMS is intended for an adult audience. Minors, especially children under the age of 16, are prohibited from sending us their personal data or signing up for a service. If we discover that such data have been transmitted to us, we will delete them from our database. The child’s parents (or legal representatives) can contact us and request deletion or unsubscription. In order to fulfil such a request, we require a copy of an official document certifying that you are the child’s parent or are otherwise responsible for the child’s upbringing.

We also take our own in-house data protection very seriously. Our employees and the service providers acting on our behalf are required to maintain confidentiality and comply with the legal provisions on data protection. Moreover, access to personal data is only granted to the extent that it is necessary.
