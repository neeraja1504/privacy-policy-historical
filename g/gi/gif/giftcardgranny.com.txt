How We Define Personal Information
For purposes of this Privacy Statement, “ Personal Information ” means any information that identifies a specific person.  For example, Personal Information includes name, address, phone number, email address, the last four digits of a Social Security number, etc.  Personal Information also includes information that does not directly identify you but when combined with other information identifies (or can be used to identify) you.
**How  We Collect and Use Your Personal Information **
How we collect and use information from you depends on how and why you use the Services. GCG collects information in the following ways:
When You Give GCG Information :  When you create an account, we may ask you for Personal Information including (but not necessarily limited to) name, email address, telephone number, and credit card or debit card number and associated card security code. Certain parts of the Services may require users to provide contact information (such as name and e-mail address), demographic information (such as ZIP code), financial information (such as credit card number and/or bank account and routing number) and other similar information. If you sign up for emails about GCG’s latest news and new products, we collect the email address that you give us. We also collect feedback, questions, and information that you provide to us for customer support.
When You Use the Services : ** ** We collect information about how and when you use the Services:

We may collect data about the location of the Device that you use to access the Services (“ Location Data ”) using IP address, GPS, cellular towers and other information from your mobile service provider, Bluetooth address, Wi-Fi access points and information made available by you or others that indicates the current or prior location of the user, such as geotag information in photographs.  How we collect Location Data depends on how you access the Services.  Certain Services may collect Location Data even when you are not actively using the Services.  If you do not want us to collect Location Data from your mobile Device, please turn off the location services in your Device settings.

From Other Sources : GCG collects information about you from third parties:
** When you Connect with Social Media through the Services** :  The Services link to social media platforms through “plug-ins” (e.g., Twitter and LinkedIn buttons). When you are logged into your social media account and access the Services, we may (depending on your settings) automatically receive information (including Personal Information) from the social media platform.  GCG collects and uses this information for the purposes described in this Privacy Statement or at the time the information is collected. Please remember that the manner in which a social media platform uses, stores and discloses your information is governed by the terms and policies applicable to your use of such platforms, and GCG has no liability or responsibility for the privacy practices or other actions of any social media platform with which you connect through the App or Services.
** From Third Parties** :  GCG may from time to time supplement the information that we collect from you with information from third parties. We may combine the third-party information with information that we already have from or about you.
** Through Service Providers** : Third parties that assist us with our business operations also collect and use information (including Personal Information) through the Services and also may share the collected information with us. For example, our service providers collect and share information with us to analyze the performance of the Services and detect and prevent fraud.
GCG uses your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Statement and for any other purpose that we disclose when we collect your Personal Information.
GCG uses Personal Information to:
• identify you when you access and use the Services and personalize your experience of the Services;
• respond to your inquiries and fulfill your requests for information, products or services;
• verify your identity;
• deliver advertisements and marketing communications to you;

• provide you with important notices about our products and policies or other administrative information;
• evaluate your eligibility for products or services;
• conduct data analysis, identify usage trends and determine the effectiveness of promotional campaigns;

If you provide GCG with access to your credit or debit card, and/or to any financial institution account, in connection or pursuant to the Services, you authorize us to collect and store your credit card, debit card, and/or financial institution account information, along with other information related to your qualifying transaction, such as purchase amount, purchase time, purchase date, and merchant for each transaction with the applicable card payment network or financial institution. As with other Personal Information, we may use that information in connection with the reason for which it was provided.
How We Use Data Collection Tools
Cookies, pixel tabs (also known as web beacons, flash cookies and clear GIFs) and similar technology (“ Data Collection Tools ”) help GCG automatically collect information about you when you use the Services.
** Web Beacons** : A web beacon (also called a pixel tag or clear GIF) is computer code that communicates information from your device to a server.  Some of our content and emails may contain embedded web beacons that allow a server to read certain types of information from your Device, allow us to count the number of people who have viewed content, to know when you opened an email message, and the IP address of your Device.  Web beacons help us develop statistical information to provide better and more personalized content.
** Cookies** :  Cookies are small text files that are sent to or accessed from your web browser or your computer’s hard drive. A cookie typically contains the name of the domain (internet location) from which the cookie originated, the “lifetime” of the cookie (i.e., when it expires), and a randomly generated unique number or similar identifier. A cookie also may contain information about your Device, such as user settings, browsing history, and activities conducted while using the Services.
GCG uses the following types of cookies:
• Strictly necessary cookies, which are required for the operation of the Services. Without them, for example, you would not be able to register or log in for the Services that GCG offers.
• Analytical/performance cookies, which allow GCG to recognize and count the number of visitors, learn how visitors navigate the Services, and improve the Services.
• Functionality cookies, which GCG uses to recognize you when you return to the Services.
• Targeting cookies, which record your visits to the Services, the pages you visited, and the links you followed. Targeting cookies helps GCG deliver digital advertisements that are targeted to your interests (as inferred from your online activity). GCG also shares information collected through targeting cookies with third parties that send you targeted advertisements.
• Interaction cookies, which allow you to connect GCG through social media.
To learn more about cookies and web beacons, visit www.allaboutcookies.org.
Data Collection Tools record how long you spend on various webpages, which webpages you view, your search queries, the products you viewed, error and performance reports, your IP address, your browser type, time zone and language settings and operating system.  Data Collection Tools also help us with fraud prevention and detection.
GCG also may use analytics services, such as Google Analytics, to collect information.  Generally, analytics services do not identify individual users.  Many analytics services allow you to opt out of data collection.  For example, to learn more about Google Analytics practices and to opt out, visit www.google.com/settings/ads or download the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.
** Your Control of Data Collection Technology :** Some web and mobile browsers provide settings that allow you to control or reject cookies or to alert you when a cookie is stored in your browser. If you set your browser to refuse to accept cookies, you may not be able to use certain features of the Services or access some of our online services. You also may be able to reject use of mobile device identifiers by activating the appropriate setting on your Device.  Although you are not required to accept cookies or mobile device identifiers, if you block or reject them, you may not have access to all features available through the Services.
How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals
Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome) incorporate a “Do Not Track” (“ DNT ”) or similar feature that signals to a website that a user does not want to have his or her online activity and behavior tracked.  If a website that responds to a particular DNT signal receives the DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain information about the browser’s user.  Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform.  For this reason, many website operators, including GCG, do not respond to DNT signals. GCG is able to offer and provide you with our Services whether or not your browser incorporates DNT signals.
**How  We Share Personal Information **
We may share Personal Information collected through the Services as follows.
Affiliates : GCG shares Personal Information within GCG’s corporate family for the purposes described in this Privacy Statement and as required by law.
Service Providers : GCG shares information with GCG’s third-party service providers that help us operate the Services, provide GCG products, and personalize your experience on the Services. Some service providers help us with payment processing, facilitating payments, sending emails, order fulfillment, conducting advertising, providing customer service or product support, industry benchmarking, consumer analysis, market research, and administering promotions.
Corporate Transactions : GCG may share and transfer Personal Information if GCG is involved in a merger, sale, acquisition, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, bankruptcy, or other change of ownership or control by GCG or any affiliated company (in each case, whether in whole or in part).
Other Lawful Disclosures : GCG also shares information: (i) as permitted by law; (ii) if we determine that disclosure of specific information is necessary to comply with the request of a law enforcement or regulatory agency or other legal process; (iii) to protect the rights, privacy, property, interests, or safety of our company or our affiliates, customers, business partners, employees, or the general public; (iv) to pursue available remedies or limit the damages; (v) to enforce the Terms of Use and Terms of Service; and (vi) to respond to an emergency.
GCG never publicly discloses any Personal Information related to financial or payment activities or any government identification numbers. GCG also doesn't allow unauthorized publishing or disclosure of any user’s non-public contacts.
How We Protect and Store Information
GCG takes precautions intended to help protect information that we collect and store; however, any transmission to us is at your own risk, and we expect that you will use appropriate security measures to protect your information.
You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account credentials and other authentication involved in obtaining access to password-protected or secure areas of the Services.  GCG will treat access to the Services through your account credentials as authorized by you.  Unauthorized access to password-protected or secure areas is prohibited and may lead to criminal prosecution.  We may suspend your use of all or part of the Services without notice if we suspect or detect any breach of security.  If you believe that information you provided to us is no longer secure, please notify us immediately using the contact information provided below.
We retain information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which you provided the information, to comply with legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce agreements, and similar essential purposes.
