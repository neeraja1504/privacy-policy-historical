What Information do we Collect?
We may collect both personally identifiable information about you and non-personally identifiable information about your visit when you access our website.
Personally Identifiable Information :  The personally identifiable information we collect includes information you submit to us.  For example, if you subscribe to online services we offer or register for certain services with us online that require registration, agree to participate in on-line surveys, participate in on-line contests, sweepstakes and promotions sponsored by us, make certain on-line information requests to us, or want to establish a profile for submission of user generated content available to other Site visitors, we may ask you to provide personally identifiable information such as your contact information (e.g., name, phone number, address and e-mail address) and user demographic information (e.g., gender, age, hobbies or interests).  Because participation in these activities is completely voluntary, you have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.
Non-personally Identifiable Information :
The non-personally identifiable information we collect includes the domain name of the site providing you with Internet access, the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet, which is usually associated with the place from which you enter the Internet, like your Internet Service Provider, your company or your university.  Our service may also collect your browser type and version, the operating system your computer is running, and other site visit data such as the pages you view, the referring page that linked you to us (e.g., another Web site or a search engine), information you search for, information or ads you click on, the average time spent on our website, and the web site you visit after this web site.  Much of this information is tracked through log files, which are stored on Company’s servers.  As explained below, we may link this information with your personal information when we feel that it is necessary to enforce compliance with our rules and policies or terms of service or to protect our Sites, customers or others.
