Visiting our Site from the European Economic Area (EEA)
The Legal Basis for Using European Personal Information
When we collect information about you through our Site the legal basis on which we process your personal information is fulfillment of an agreement between us, namely, to provide you with the products and services or the Giant Vapes Newsletters and other information marketing our products in response to your request.
When we collect information about you through our Site, the legal basis on which we process your personal information is the performance of our agreement with you to purchase or review products. When we use your personal information outside of what is strictly necessary for that transaction, we are doing so toward our legitimate interest of informing you of related products and promotions.
To the extent that we transfer personal information from the EEA to a jurisdiction outside the EEA that has not been adduced by the European Commission as providing adequate data protections (such as the US), we will ensure that such personal information is safeguarded through appropriate contractual terms.

In addition, if you are a resident of the EEA, you have the right to:
Find out if we use your personal information, to access your personal information, and receive copies of your personal information.
Withdraw any express consent that you have provided to the processing of your personal information at any time without penalty.
Access your personal information and have it corrected or amended if it is inaccurate or incomplete.
Obtain a transferable copy of some of your personal information which can be transferred to another provider when the personal information was processed based on your consent.
If you believe your personal information is inaccurate, no longer necessary for our business purposes, or if you object to our processing of your personal information, you also have the right to request that we restrict the processing of your data pending our investigation and/or verification of your claim.
Request your personal information be deleted or restricted under certain circumstances. For example, if Giant Vapes is using your personal information on the basis of your consent and has no other legal basis to use such, you may request your personal information be deleted when you withdraw your consent.

If you object to any such changes, you must immediately cease using the Site.   A User is bound by any changes to this Privacy Notice when he, she or it uses the Site after those changes have been posted.
