6. Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies
We use cookies, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash Local Storage Objects (“Flash LSOs”) and similar technologies, including technologies designed for mobile applications, to track user activity and collect usage data about our Sites and App. We may combine this data with the personal data we have collected from you.
Cookies. Cookies allow a web server to transfer data to a computer for record keeping and other purposes. We and our service providers use “cookies” on our Sites and similar devices designed for mobile applications, to, among other things, better serve you with tailored information and facilitate your ongoing access to and use of the Site. There are two types of cookies: session-based and persistent cookies.
Session Cookies. Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser or turn off your computer. We use session cookies to allow our systems to uniquely identify you during a session or while you are logged in to the Site (and the Apps). This allows us to process your online transactions and requests and verify your identity, after you have logged in, as you move through our Sites and App.
Persistent Cookies. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or turned off your computer. We use persistent cookies to track aggregate and statistical information about user activity, which may be combined with other user information.
Disabling Cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Visitors to our Sites who disable their web browsers’ ability to accept cookies will be able to browse the Sites; homarkwever, certain site features, such as the shopping cart or the ability to find the location of a lab, may not function if you disable cookies.
Local Storage Objects. We may use Flash LSOs in order to store your Site preferences and to support individual applications. Flash LSOs are different from browser cookies because of the amount and type of data stored. In addition, you cannot control, delete or disable the acceptance of Flash LSOs through your browser. For more information on Flash LSOs, or to learn how to manage your settings for Flash cookies, go to the Adobe Flash Player Help Page, choose “Global Storage Settings Panel” and follow the instructions. To see the Flash LSOs currently on your computer, choose “Website Storage Settings Panel” and follow the instructions to review and, if you choose, to delete any specific Flash LSO.
Web Beacons, Pixel Tags and Other Technologies. Our service providers use web beacons in HTML emails to our customers, to help us track email response rates, measure the success of our marketing campaigns, identify when our emails are viewed and track whether our emails are forwarded.
Analytics. We work with service providers (including Google Analytics and Flurry) who conduct analytics to help us track and understand how visitors use our Sites and our App. If you prefer not to participate in Flurry, please follow the instructions provided at http://www.flurry.com/. Google Analytics is a web analytics service provided by Google that uses cookies to help us analyze how users use our Sites and our App. The information generated by the cookies about your use of the services will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. If you access the Sites or our App through different devices, Google may associate your devices with one another. Google has developed the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on for the Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js, analytics.js, dc.js). You can prevent Google’s collection and use of the data it collects as defined in its policy by downloading and installing this browser plug-in: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB.
