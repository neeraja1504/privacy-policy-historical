Girl Rising
Ten Times Ten, LLC (“Ten Times Ten/Girl Rising,” “we,” “our,” “us”) respects your privacy. This policy describes how we collect, use, and share information related to you.
Global Internet Privacy Policy
It is our policy commitment to be transparent about our practices. This commitment reflects the value we place on earning and keeping the trust of our activists, users, viewers, employees, nonprofit and business partners and others who share their personal information with us.
This Global Internet Privacy Policy (this “Policy”) describes how we collect, use, and share information when you access the websites, mobile applications, or other online services that we own or operate and that link to this policy (collectively, the “Services”). As used in this Policy, the term “personal information” means information that may directly identify you personally such as name, address, telephone number, email address, etc.
As used in this Policy, the term “aggregate information” means non-personally identifiable/anonymous information about visitors, including but not limited to age, gender, frequency of visits to the Services, parts of the Services most frequently accessed, search terms entered, browser type, IP address, etc. Aggregate information is reviewed and analyzed on a collective basis and will not be linked to the identity of any individual person. By accessing the Services, you agree to be bound by the Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Policy, please do not use the Services. Each time you use the Services, the current version of the Policy will apply.
Accordingly, when you use the Services, you should check the Effective Date of this Policy (which appears at the end of the document) and review any changes since the last version.
Information Collected on the Services and How It May Be Used
When you access and use the Services, there are 3 ways we may collect information about you:
Information Collected Automatically
We may collect information automatically from your device, browser, or application when you access the Services. This information typically includes, but is not limited to, the IP address of your Internet service provider, the type of device you use to access the Services, the name of your operating system (such as Macintosh or Windows) and the name and version of your browser (such as Internet Explorer, Chrome or Firefox). The information we receive depends on the settings on your web browser, device or application. We and our service providers may collect information over time and across different websites when you use the Online Services. Information Collected By Placing a “Cookie” On Your Computer We may collect information by installing a “tag” or similar technology on your device. These technologies are often called “cookies.” Our websites use cookies to collect statistical information about the ways visitors use our Services – which pages they visit, which links they use, and how long they stay on each page. We analyze this information (known as “clickstream data”) in statistical form to better understand our visitors’ interests and needs to improve the content and functionality of our websites. We may also use information collected via cookies to deliver ads based on your use of the Services. For information about how to opt out of interest-based ads, please visit https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en.
If you do not wish us to place cookies on your device, you may be able to set your browser to reject cookies or to alert you when a cookie is placed on your computer. Although you are not required to accept cookies when you visit the Services, you may be unable to use all of the functionality of the Services if your browser rejects our cookies. We use GoSquared and Google Analytics to collect information about the use of the Services. GoSquared and Google Analytics collect information such as how often users visit the Services and what pages users visited prior to visiting the Services. We use this information to maintain and improve our Services. For information about how Google uses the information, see Terms of Service and the Google Privacy Policy. You can opt out of Google Analytics by visiting https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.

We collect information that you provide when you use the Services, for example the information you provide when you sign up to receive email alerts, when you complete a survey, when you enter a search term on the Services, or when you ask us a question or email us with feedback.
In some cases this information will be personal information. Girl Rising uses this information for the purposes for which you provide it. For example, if you provide your e-mail address when you sign up to receive e-mail alerts, we use your e-mail address to deliver the e-mail alerts you request.
We may also use the information we collect on the Services for various business purposes such as customer service, fraud prevention, market research, improving our products and services, and providing you with information and offers we believe may be of or interest to you. We may also remove personal information from our files and use the aggregate information for historical, statistical or scientific purposes
Sharing/Disclosing Personal Information and Aggregate Information
We may share, transfer or disclose your personal information collected on the Services to affiliates and other entities related to us. We may share information with service providers that provide services to us in connection with our operations (e.g., web hosting and mailing services). We may share, sell, transfer or otherwise disclose your personal information collected on the Services to third parties unrelated to Girl Rising, including charitable organizations, so these third parties can contact you for marketing and promotional purposes. Our current NGO partners are listed in the “Partners” sections of our website. These lists are subject to change.
In addition, we may share or transfer information: (i) to comply with a legal requirement or court order; (ii) to investigate a possible crime, such as identity theft; (iii) in connection with the sale, purchase, merger, reorganization, liquidation or dissolution of Ten Times Ten/Girl Rising; or (iv) when we believe it is appropriate to do so to protect the rights, property, or safety of us or others. In the event of such a sale, purchase, merger, reorganization, liquidation or dissolution of Ten Times Ten, we will use reasonable efforts to try to require that the acquiring entity use personal information you have provided through this Services in a manner that is consistent with this Policy.
Security of Personal Information
We maintain physical, managerial, and technical safeguards designed to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of your personal information. Although we use security measures to help protect your personal information against unauthorized disclosure, misuse, or alteration, as is the case with all computer networks linked to the Internet, we cannot guarantee the security of information provided over the Internet and will not be responsible for breaches of security.
Links to Third Party Internet Sites
The Services may contain links to Internet sites or other online services that are not owned or operated by us. These links are provided as a service and do not imply any endorsement of the activities or content of these sites, nor any association with their operators. We do not control these third-party services, and we are not responsible for their content, security, or privacy practices. We urge you to review the privacy policy posted on the online services you visit before using the services or providing personal information.
