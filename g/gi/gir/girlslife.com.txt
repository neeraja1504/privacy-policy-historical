Our subscription department allows anyone over 13 to request or order the magazine, renew a subscription, give a gift subscription or give us a change of address. In order to process those requests, we need to have the following information: Your name, address, e-mail address. We will also ask for the name and address of the girl you are sending the magazine to. If you are renewing or changing your address, we will also ask for your customer number.

Will anyone know how I answer questions on your site? Or if I ask them?
Girlslife.com visitors can send questions to several different experts whose wisdom we share on our web site.
• We ask that all girls sign their letters with a nickname or name related to the concern (i.e. Boy Baffled, In Need of a Mascara Master, Bewildered and Confused, etc).
