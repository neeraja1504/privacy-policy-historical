Privacy Policy - Gigya
Protecting the individual’s privacy on the Internet is crucial to the future of Internet-based business and the move towards a true Internet economy. We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to the individuals’ right to data protection and privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines our handling practices with regards to such information that can be used to directly or indirectly identify an individual (“Personal Data”).
A. GENERAL INFORMATION
When does this Privacy Policy apply? This Privacy Policy applies to Personal Data that you provide to us or which is derived from such Personal Data as further outlined below. For additional information about cookies and other web tracking technologies that we are using please see also our Cookie Policy.
Data Controller. Data controller in case of the website www.gigya.com (“Website”) is Gigya, Inc., 2513 E. Charleston Rd, Suite 200, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (“Gigya”). Gigya, Inc. is a subsidiary of SAP America Inc., which is an affiliate of SAP SE and thus part of the SAP group. The group’s data protection officer is Mathias Cellarius (privacy@sap.com).
What does Gigya do with my Personal Data? Gigya will process the Personal Data provided hereunder only as set out in this Privacy Policy. Where the processing of your Personal Data is based on a statutory permission, you can find information on which Personal Data Gigya is processing or using and the corresponding purposes for such processing or use in Section B. below. Where consent for the processing of your Personal Data is required you can find further information in Section C. below. Section D. describes Gigya’s processing operations (as a data processor) with regard to Personal Data about individuals (“End Users”) at the direction and on behalf of users (“Customers”) of the Gigya services (“Services”) (as the data controllers). In this Privacy Policy, “Services” include Gigya’s web services, products, offerings, contests, sweepstakes, other content, non-marketing related newsletters, whitepapers, tutorials, trainings and events. Section E. provides further information about transfers of Personal Data outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”).
Duration of processing of Personal Data. Notwithstanding those instances where your Personal Data is processed or used by Gigya based on a statutory permission (see Section B. below) or your consent (see Section C. below), Gigya will only store your Personal Data (i) for as long as it is required to fulfil the purposes set out below, (ii) until you object to Gigya’s use of your Personal Data (if Gigya uses your Personal Data based on legitimate interest), or (iii) until you withdraw your consent (if Gigya uses your Personal Data based on your consent). However, where Gigya is required by mandatory law to retain your Personal Data longer or where your Personal Data is required for Gigya to assert or defend against legal claims, Gigya will retain your Personal Data until the end of the relevant retention period or the settlement of the claims in question.
Why am I required to provide Personal Data? As a general principle, granting of any consent and the provision of any Personal Data hereunder is entirely voluntarily to you. However, there are circumstances where Gigya cannot take action without certain Personal Data (e.g., because Personal Data is required to process your orders or provide you with access to a web offering or newsletter). In these cases it will unfortunately not be possible for Gigya to provide you with what you request without the relevant Personal Data.
Where Gigya will my Personal Data be processed? The Website is hosted in the United States, and as part of the SAP global group of companies, Gigya has affiliates and third-party service providers within as well as outside of the EEA. As a consequence, whenever Gigya is using or otherwise processing your Personal Data for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, Gigya may transfer your Personal Data to countries outside of the EEA, including to such countries where a statutory level of data protection applies that is not comparable to the level of data protection within the EEA, as further described in this Privacy Policy under Section E.
Data subjects’ rights. You can request from Gigya at any time information about which Personal Data Gigya processes about you and the correction or deletion of such Personal Data.  Notwithstanding your request, Gigya may retain your Personal Data if there is a statutory obligation or prevailing right of Gigya to retain it. Kindly note that if you request the deletion of your Personal Data from Gigya you will not be able to further use such Gigya Services which require Gigya’s use of your Personal Data.
If Gigya uses your Personal Data based on your consent or to perform a contract with you, you may further request from Gigya a copy of the Personal Data that you have provided to Gigya  To make such a request, please contact the email address below and specify the information or processing activities to which your request relates, the requested format for your Personal Data (provided it is commonly used), and whether the Personal Data shall be provided to you or another recipient. Gigya will carefully review your request and discuss with you how it can be best implemented.
Furthermore, you can request from Gigya that Gigya restricts your Personal Data from any further processing in any of the following events: (i) you state that the Personal Data Gigya has about you is incorrect, however, only for as long as Gigya requires to check the accuracy of the relevant Personal Data, (ii) there is no legal basis for Gigya’s processing of your Personal Data and you demand that Gigya restricts your Personal Data from further processing, (iii) Gigya no longer requires your Personal Data but you claim that you require such data in order to claim or exercise legal rights or to defend against third party claims, or (iv) in case you object to the processing of your Personal Data by Gigya for as long as it is required to review as to whether Gigya has a prevailing interest or legal obligation in processing your Personal Data.
Please direct any such request to privacy@gigya.com.
Right to lodge a complaint. If you take the view that Gigya is not processing your Personal Data in accordance with the requirements set out herein or applicable EEA data protection laws, you can at any time lodge a complaint with the data protection authority of the EEA country where you live.
Use of this website by children. The Website is not directed toward individuals under the age of thirteen (13), and we request that such individuals do not provide Personal Data through our Website. Additionally, we do not knowingly collect or maintain Personal Data from anyone under the age of 13, unless or except as permitted by law. If we learn that Personal Data has been collected from a user under 13 years of age on or through the Website, then we will take the appropriate steps to cause this information to be deleted.
