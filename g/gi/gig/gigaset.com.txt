Use of Facebook social plugins
Our website uses social plugins ("plugins") provided by the social network facebook.com, operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Avenue, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA ("Facebook"). The plugins are identifiable by a Facebook logo (white letter f on blue background or a thumb up icon) or the notice "Facebook Social Plugin". For a full list of all social plugins please see: http://developers.facebook.com/plugins.
When you visit a page of our website that contains a social plugin, your browser establishes a direct connection to the Facebook servers. Facebook transmits the content of the plugin directly to your browser and the browser integrates it into the web page. We therefore have no influence on the scope of the data that Facebook collects using this plugin and can only provide the information we currently possess:
The embedded plugins provide Facebook with the information that you have accessed the corresponding page of our website. If you are logged into Facebook, your visit can be assigned to your Facebook account. If you interact with the plugins, for example by clicking "Like", or entering a comment, the corresponding information is transmitted from your browser directly to Facebook and stored by it. If you are not a member of Facebook, it is still possible that Facebook may learn and store your IP address.
For further information on the purpose and scope of data collection and further processing and use of the data by Facebook, as well as your corresponding rights and setting options for protecting your privacy, see the Facebook privacy policy: http://www.facebook.com/policy.php.
If you are a Facebook member and do not want Facebook to connect the data concerning your visit to our website with your member data already stored by Facebook, please log off Facebook before entering our website.
Further you can block Facebook social Plugins by using add-ons for your browser, like the "Facebook Blocker".

Google Analytics

The information created by the cookie about your use of this website, such as the time you visited the website as well as the frequency and the action path, is transferred to a Google server and stored there. The server may be outside your country of residence. However, your IP address is automatically truncated, making it anonymous, and is not merged with other data from Google. Due to legal requirements, for example, and for the performance of tasks on behalf of Google (e.g., billing or data storage), the information created can be made available to third parties. In this case, Google will ensure that this data is only processed in compliance with the respective data protection provisions and security measures. On behalf of the operator of this website, Google uses this information to evaluate your use of the website, to create reports about the website activities and to perform further services connected with website use and Internet use for the website operator. You can prevent the cookies being saved via a setting in your browser software. However, please be aware that if you change this setting, you may not be able to use all of the functions of this website to their full extent.
