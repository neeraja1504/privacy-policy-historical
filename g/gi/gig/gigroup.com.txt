Privacy - Gi Group - Your job our work - Employment agency
The confidentiality of personal data is a right which the Gi Group companies seek to respect, and for this purpose, they wish to make known, even in accordance with Article 13 of the Legislative Decree of the 30 June 2003 no. 196 (regarding the Personal Data Protection Code), the norms and procedures which regulate the processing of personal data as well as the way it is gathered and used, and the choices available to the user. The present declaration on the confidentiality of personal data, available on the Group’s Portal (www.gigroup.com) and in the various home pages of the Group’s companies, applies to all the websites and domains of the Group’s companies [«.it», «.eu», «.com», «.net», «.org» and «.info»] and may be subject to updates.
All the websites of the Group’s companies are structured in a way so as to allow the user to visit them without identifying him/herself or revealing personal information in any way. The present portal contains links to the Group’s companies and is used both as a means of obtaining information of the activities that took place as well as a tool for collecting data.
Links to websites which are not part of Gi Group
To give the user more convenience and information, the Group’s Portal and websites of the Group’s companies may contain links to other companies’ websites. If one gains access to these links one leaves the Group’s portal or the website of the Group’s company. The Group’s companies have no control over these sites, neither on the procedures which they apply to respect data confidentiality. These procedures can therefore be different from those adopted by the Group’s companies, which, consequently, do not assume any responsibility in relation to other companies’ websites. The personal data which the client decides to disclose to third parties not linked to the Group’s companies are not covered by the present Declaration of confidentiality. Therefore, before disclosing personal information, the users are invited to consult the regulations on the privacy of the persons with whom they come into contact. Certain companies which are unconnected with the Group may decide to share the personal data they possess with the Group. In this case, the regulation used by the company in question to deal with personal data is applied.

Such information does not allow identification of the user’s personal data.
Use of data
The companies of the Group offer the possibility to receive various kinds of information to complement one’s own core business.

Alternatively, the user can cancel through the relevant procedure available on the websites, by following the instructions to suspend subscription.

The Group’s companies commit themselves to protect the information given by the candidates or visitors.

The Group’s societies send cookies when their sites are used, when information is requested or personalized or when one registers for particular services. If the visitor’s computer accepts the cookies used by the sites of the Group’s companies, the visitor does not have the possibility to access his personal information but can use the cookies to identify the computer. Normally, cookies are classified as «temporary» or «permanent». «Temporary» cookies do not remain on the computer once one leaves the website or after the browser is closed. The aggregate information collected allows the Group’s companies to analyse the site’s traffic patterns. In this way, it is possible to improve the site by modifying or personalising the content, thus making it more user-friendly.
«Permanent» cookies, on the other hand, remain on the visitor’s computer. They enable one to facilitate navigation, personalization and registration services. Cookies, for instance, can keep track of services asked for and the pages visited up to that time and enable one to put the password only once in web pages which request user identification. The user can manually remove «permanent» cookies.
