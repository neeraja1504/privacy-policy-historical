User Information
Information We Collect
Gizmodiva collects user submitted account information such as name and email address to identify you and send you notifications related to the use of the service. Gizmodiva also collects user submitted location information such as city, state or zip. Gizmodiva also collects user submitted photos, reviews, and ratings of content around the web. Some information collected is not explicitly submitted by the user; we log your browser-type related information, IP address, requested URL, referring URL, and timestamp.
How We Use Your Information
Information such as your full name, profile photo and any personally identifiable information you have included in your profile may be shown to friends or other users primarily in conjunction with content you have contributed. Your full name and email address may also be used when you send an email notification to a friend (such as in an invitation). We may also use your email address to send you updates or news regarding our site, but you may choose not to receive email of this type by editing your preferences in your profile. Additionally, we use your email address to contact you on behalf of your friends (such as when someone sends you a personal message).
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use aggregated information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please see: http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp
Browser-type related information, IP address, requested URL, referring URL, and timestamp data help us diagnose problems with our server, administer Gizmodiva, and otherwise provide the highest possible level of service to you. In addition, we use this information to perform statistical analyses of user behavior and characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of the site and to inform advertisers of such information as well as the number of users that have been exposed to, or clicked on, their advertising banners.
Transfer of Information
Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, we do not sell, rent, share, trade or give away any of your personal information. Gizmodiva will disclose information about individual users to governmental or judicial authorities or law enforcement agencies, or to other individuals or entities in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal processes. Further, Gizmodiva may share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities or suspected fraud, or to enforce or apply the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.
We reserve the right to transfer your personal information in the event of a transfer of ownership of Gizmodiva, such as an acquisition by or merger with another company. In such an event, Gizmodiva will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Gizmodiva will notify you when information about you may be provided to third parties in ways other than explained above, and you will have the option to prevent such information sharing.
Controlling Your Personal Information
You should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information (e.g., user name, e-mail address) via comments, messages, forums, postings, or in other areas of the Gizmodiva network, that information, along with any substantive information disclosed in your communication, can be collected and correlated and used by third parties and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of Gizmodiva. Please do not post any personal information on the Gizmodiva site or in other areas that you expect to keep private.
As a registered Gizmodiva user, you can modify your personal information at any time by editing your “Profile”. Also, upon your request, Gizmodiva will use commercially reasonable efforts to functionally remove you and your personal information from the site; however, it may be impossible to remove your entry without some residual information being retained by Gizmodiva. Registered users who wish to close their account should contact Gizmodiva@gmail.com.

Our website may contain links to third party websites to which we have no affiliation. Gizmodiva does not share your personal information with those websites and is not responsible for their privacy practices. We suggest you read the privacy polices on these third party websites.
