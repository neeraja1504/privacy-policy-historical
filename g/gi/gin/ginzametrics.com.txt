Information Gathering

As a data processor for a Business Customer, we make available this privacy policy so that each Business Customer can better understand our data practices and whether they are consistent with privacy notices such Business Customer has made available to its data subjects. We only collect the information about a Business Customer’s data subjects that such Business Customer provides to us or directs us to collect (“Customer Information”). We may obtain EU and Swiss Personal from data subjects regarding name, postal address, e-mail address, phone number, as well as information relating to payment-card, personal health, clinical-trial data, demographics, purchase history, market-research, employee and student performance and any information a Business Customer may send or direct us to collect from third parties at such Business Customer’s direction. We do not control what Customer Information we receive and host, nor what steps a Business Customer as data controller has taken to ensure that the data is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete and current.
