Where you have requested participation in a clinical trial with Gilead or one of Gilead’s partners;
Disease management, education, or decision support systems related to the use of Gilead products or services;

WHAT DATA WE COLLECT
When interacting with Gilead, you may choose to provide us with information to help us serve your needs. The Personal Information that we collect will depend on how you choose to interact with Gilead.
Where you participate in Clinical Trials
If you participate in a clinical trial with Gilead, or one of our partners, we will collect Personal Information about you as is necessary to fulfill the purpose of the clinical trial. This can include SPI such as biological and medical information about you. However, as required by the Principles, Personal Information will be Pseudonymized, as appropriate, to both protect your privacy as well as maintain the integrity of the clinical trial.
Where you request information about our services
If you request further information about our services, we require you to submit your name, e-mail address, the name of your organization, and the country in which you are based so we may send you the material you have requested, and to enable us to identify whether you have an existing relationship with Gilead.
Where you register with us and/or request services
If you register with us, or request a service available on the Site, we may ask you for your name, e-mail address, country, telephone number and the reason for your communication; as well as information about your position, organization, and such other information as is reasonably necessary so that we can provide you with the service. On the data submission form, we shall indicate by way of an asterisk, which information is optional and which information is mandatory. This information can include information you provide on applications or other forms, which may include your name, address, email address, and payment information.
Individuals should not provide Gilead with any Personal Information that is not specifically requested. Where Gilead receives Personal Information from its subsidiaries, affiliates, or other entities, it will use or disclose such Personal Information in accordance with the above procedures.
Gilead may consolidate or aggregate Personal Information in a non-identifiable form (anonymized/Pseudonymized data) to help Gilead improve product design and services, to enhance Gilead’s research activities, and to facilitate other business functions.
DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO OTHERS
We do not disclose any Personal Information about you to any third parties except as stated in this Privacy Statement or as notified to you, or as otherwise permitted by law, or authorized by you.
Generally
Third parties to whom we disclose information are required by law and contractual undertakings to keep your Personal Information confidential and secure; and to use and disclose it for purposes that a reasonable person would consider appropriate in the circumstances, in compliance with all applicable legislation, which purposes are as follows:
As is necessary to fulfill a clinical trial to which you are a participant;
To provide the products and services you have requested from us;
To notify you, or allow our affiliated companies to notify you of certain products or services offered by our affiliated companies;
For legal, regulatory, and related purposes; and
To process transactions through data processing service providers.
If these third parties wish to use your Personal Information for any other purpose, they will have a legal obligation to notify you of this and, where required, to obtain your consent.  Contact us at privacy@gilead.com for more information on these third parties.
Affiliate Sharing
In the normal course of performing services for our clients, Personal Information may be shared within Gilead and its affiliates for research and statistical purposes, drug safety and efficacy purposes, disease management, system administration and crime prevention or detection, or any purpose otherwise identified in this Privacy Statement.
Service Providers
Because a number of the service providers we use in pursuance of the purposes mentioned above are located in countries other than your own, your Personal Information will be processed and stored inside those other countries, and those countries’ governments, courts, or law enforcement or regulatory agencies may be able to obtain disclosure of your Personal Information under local laws.
Business Transactions
As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy assets. In such transactions, user information, including Personal Information, generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, if either Gilead itself or substantially all of Gilead assets were acquired, your Personal Information may be one of the transferred assets. Therefore, we may disclose and/or transfer your Personal Information to a third-party in these circumstances.
Other Legally Required Disclosures
Gilead reserves the right to disclose without your prior permission any Personal Information about you or your use of this Site if Gilead has a good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) protect and defend the rights, property or safety of Gilead, employees, other users of this Site, or the public; (b) enforce the terms and conditions that apply to use of this Site; (c) as required by a legally valid request from a competent governmental authority and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process; or (d) respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third parties. We may also disclose Personal Information as we deem necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request.
Choice:
Where Gilead relies on consent for the fair and lawful processing of Personal Information, the opportunity to consent will be provided prior to when the Personal Information in question is collected. Your consent may be given through your authorized representative such as a legal guardian, agent, or holder of a power of attorney. Where Gilead relies on consent, you will be entitled to withdraw that consent at any time.
For SPI, Gilead will provide individuals the opportunity to affirmatively and explicitly authorize or consent to the collection, processing, transfer, or disclosure of their SPI to a non-Agent third party or the use of their SPI for a purpose other than the one for which the individual originally consented.
Gilead will not disclose your Personal Information to third parties except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Statement or otherwise notified to you.
Gilead maintains servers and other storage facilities in the United States, EU, and Asia. Gilead may transfer Personal Information outside of its country of origin for the purposes, and in the manner, set out above; including for processing and storage by Service Providers and Affiliates in connection with such purposes. In all situations, Gilead takes reasonable steps to ensure that your privacy is protected. Such steps include, but are not limited to: implementing privacy, security, and contractual controls; as well as steps noted above, as required by applicable law. To the extent that any Personal Information is sent out of an individual’s country, it is subject to the laws of the country in which it is held, and may be subject to disclosure to the governments, courts, or law enforcement or regulatory agencies of such other country, pursuant to the laws of such country, consistent with the Principles.
Accountability for Onward Transfers: Gilead will obtain assurances from its Service Providers and Affiliates that they will safeguard Personal Information consistent with this Privacy Statement. An example of appropriate assurances that may be provided by Service Providers and Affiliates includes a contractual obligation that they provide at least the same level of protection as is required by Gilead’s privacy principles set out in this Privacy Statement. Where Gilead has knowledge that a Service Provider or Affiliate is using or disclosing Personal Information in a manner contrary to this Privacy Statement, Gilead will take appropriate steps to prevent or stop the use or disclosure. Gilead also complies with the Privacy Shield Principle regarding liability for onward transfers.
Security
Gilead has implemented reasonable physical, technical and managerial controls and safeguards to keep your Personal Information protected from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Such measures may include, but are not limited to: the encryption of communications via SSL, encryption of information while it is in storage, firewalls, access controls, separation of duties, and similar security protocols.
Access to Personal Information is limited to a restricted number of Gilead employees whose duties reasonably require such information, Agents with whom Gilead contracts to carry out business activities for Gilead, and, with an individual’s consent, certain companies with which Gilead may conduct joint programs. Gilead trains its employees on the importance of privacy and how to handle and manage Personal Information appropriately and securely. Personal Information handled by Agents, or companies with which Gilead may conduct joint programs, is governed by this Privacy Statement and the Principles.
Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation
Gilead will use Personal Information only in ways that are compatible with the purposes for which it was collected, or consented to by the individual. Gilead will have appropriate steps in place to ensure that Personal Information is relevant to its intended use, accurate, complete, and current. Gilead will only store Personal Information for as long as it is needed to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, subject to applicable data retention periods imposed upon Gilead by applicable law. This may mean that your Personal Information is stored by Gilead for a number of years, depending on the purpose and need for that data to be processed. For more information about Gilead’s retention periods for Personal Information, please refer to the contact information section below.
Your Rights
Where individuals have rights under laws applicable to them and upon written request, Gilead will grant individuals access to Personal Information that it holds about them, subject to any legal restrictions.  In addition, Gilead will permit individuals to correct, amend, or delete information that is demonstrated to be inaccurate or incomplete or to object to certain types of processing of such information or to data portability, in certain circumstances and subject to certain exceptions provided by law. Gilead may not be able to comply with a request where Personal Information has been destroyed, erased or made anonymous in accordance with Gilead’s record retention obligations and practices. In the event that Gilead cannot provide an individual with access to his/her Personal Information, Gilead will endeavor to provide the individual with an explanation, subject to any legal or regulatory restrictions.
Recourse Enforcement and Liability

Binding Arbitration
In the event that you cannot fully resolve your complaint through the above mechanisms, it is possible that you may use binding arbitration as a final resort. In order to invoke this arbitration option you must take the following steps prior to initiating an arbitration claim: (1) raise the claimed violation directly with Gilead and afford us an opportunity to respond to the issue within 45 days; (2) make use of the independent recourse mechanism, in this case TRUSTe, which is at no cost to you; and (3) raise the issue through your Data Protection Authority to the Department of Commerce and afford the Department of Commerce an opportunity to use best efforts to resolve the issue.
This arbitration option may not be invoked if your same claimed violation (1) has previously been subject to binding arbitration; (2) was the subject of a final judgment entered in a court action to which you were a party; or (3) was previously settled by you and us. In addition, you may not invoke this option where the Data Protection Authority of the country of your residence already has jurisdiction to resolve your complaint.
You may initiate binding arbitration, subject to the pre-arbitration requirements provision above, by delivering a “Notice” to the organization. The Notice shall contain a summary of steps taken to resolve the claim, a description of the alleged violation, and, at the choice of the individual, any supporting documents and materials and/or a discussion of law relating to the alleged claim. For more information on how to invoke arbitration under the Privacy Shield Framework, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-introduction.
Finally, you may only use binding arbitration to ensure Gilead follows the data handling practices set out in this Privacy Statement. No other form of remedy is available by any arbitration under this section.
