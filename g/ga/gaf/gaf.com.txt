We may obtain information about you from third parties. For example, our business partners may provide us with information about you.
Location Information.
Our apps may collect precise information about the location of your mobile device when location services are enabled on your device. We may use the information to provide you with information, promotions, or advertising relevant to your location. We do not share location information with third parties for their independent use without your consent.

We may combine the information we collect. For example, we might combine information you give us with information we get from a public source.

We use information as permitted by law and as otherwise disclosed to you. For example, we may use the information we collect to protect the rights and property of us, you, and others.
We may share information with third parties.
We will share information within our Company. We may share your information with our affiliates or subsidiaries. We may also share information with other related entities.
We will share information with third parties who perform services on our behalf, and the information provided may be used for any of the purposes set forth in this policy. For example, we may share your information with vendors.

We may share information with third party marketing partners. For example, we might share information with a company with whom we are running a joint promotion.
