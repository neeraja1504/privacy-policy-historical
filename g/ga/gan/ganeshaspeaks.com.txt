GaneshaSpeaks.com Privacy Policy
In order to demonstrate our sincerity and commitment to protecting the customer’s privacy, we at GaneshaSpeaks.com have chalked out this privacy policy. We respect the need for privacy in our clients, and we do realise the importance of feeling safe and secure whenever a client transacts with us. Please note that we are fully committed towards protecting our clients’ personal information, and take all possible steps to ensure that transactions at Ganeshaspeaks.com are absolutely secure. Following are the salient points of our privacy policy
Information collected
When our clients choose to use our personalized services and features, they are required to register with their personal profile on the website. In the process, they may be required to proffer information such as name, gender, birth information, e-mail ID, password, place of residence, postcode, etc. This information is vital for us to create horoscopes and provide accurate personalized reports to our clients. The clients’ e-mail ID and password are used to protect their personal profile. This also makes our personalized e-mail service available to them. Non-personal identifiable information about our clients is collected on the website from their IP address or pages surfed. However, we wish to clarify here that we do not collect any personally-identifiable information about our customers, unless they voluntarily proffer such information, while using our products and services by filling out forms or surveys.
We do collect personally identifiable information from our clients via feedback forms and surveys, but in this case it is voluntarily provided by the clients, as this information is used by us to make our products and services better and more accurate. This also ensures that their entire experience with us is more rewarding.
We have found that customers who have used our services once tend to come back for more, which is precisely because we honour their privacy and confidence in us, and give them exactly the content they ask for, and nothing that is not relevant to their query.
Use of information
The data that we collect from our clients is used to deliver personalized reports, for internal marketing purposes, trend analysis, to figure out patterns of usage as well as for better website administration. We do not, as a matter of policy, disclose any personally identifiable information to third parties unless the customers give us their prior express consent. Still, it is pertinent to note, that under certain circumstances such as a court order or under prevailing government norms, we may be compelled to disclose such information. Also, we cannot guarantee that third parties my unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Besides, in cases where we ask our clients for personally identifiable information and notify them that it will be shared with third parties entities, and our customers opt-in to share the information with them, such an opt-in will supersede anything to the contrary contained in this privacy policy.
Use of IP addresses
The client’s IP address is used by GaneshaSpeaks.com for more efficient administration of the website, to identify problems with our server and to keep a tab on general trends and statistics.
Use of cookies

We would also save passwords, so the clients don’t have to re-enter it every time they visit the site. However, they have the option of setting their browser, so that it notifies them when a cookie is sent, and they can decide whether to accept it or not. It needs to be remembered, though, that certain sections of the website may not function optimally, if cookies are deactivated or rejected.
Use of e-mail address
We give the assurance that the e-mail addresses given for receiving our reports and services will be safe with us, as we will never disclose it to the third parties. Any horoscopes or other special offers that the clients choose to receive will be sent to them exclusively by GaneshaSpeaks.com.
