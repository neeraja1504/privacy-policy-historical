This Privacy Policy provides our policies and procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing your information. Users can access the smartapp.com service (the “ Service ”) – a property of InQuest Technologies, Inc (“ InQuest ”) through our website www.smartapp.com, applications on devices, through APIs, and through third-parties. A “ Device ” is any computer used to access the smartapp.com Service, including without limitation a desktop, laptop, mobile phone, tablet, or other consumer electronic device. This Privacy Policy governs your access of the smartapp.com Service, regardless of how you access it, and by using our Services you consent to the collection, analysis, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure and other uses described in this Privacy Policy. All of the different forms of data, content, and information described below are collectively referred to as “ Information ”, including without limitation, user or company profile, uploaded content and other content (e.g. comments, feedback or suggestions) you submit to smartapp.com through any Device.
1. The Information We Collect And Store
We may collect and store the following Information when running the smartapp.com Service, including; but not limited to:
Personal Information.    When you register an account, we collect some personal information (“ Personal Information ”), such as your name and email address. You may also register an account using one of your social media networks, including but not limited to: Facebook, LinkedIn, and Google. When registering an account through social media we collect additional information including but not limited to: your picture, skills, industry and location. When you invite others to join smartapp.com by using our sharing or invite feature, you provide us with their email addresses and we may send them an email to access the shared item or join smartapp.com. We may also receive Personal Information (for example, your email address) through other users, for example if they have tried to share something with you or invited you to use a smartapp.com feature.
Files.    We collect and store the files you upload, download, or access with the smartapp.com Service (“ Files ”).
App Data.    We collect and store user and/or app-generated data with the smartapp.com Service (“ Data ”).
Log Data.    When you use the Service, we automatically record information from your Device, its software, and your activity using the Services. This may include the Device’s Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, the web page visited before you came to our website, information you search for on our website, locale preferences, identification numbers associated with your Devices, your mobile carrier, date and time stamps associated with transactions, system configuration information, metadata concerning your Files, and other interactions with the Service.
Cookies.    We also use “cookies” to collect information and improve our Services. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your Device. We may use “session ID cookies” to enable certain features of the Service, to better understand how you interact with the Service and to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on the Service. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all aspects of the Service.
2. How We Use Your Information
Personal Information.    In the course of using the Service, we may collect personal information that can be used to contact or identify you (“ Personal Information ”). Personal Information is or may be used: (i) to provide and improve our Service, (ii) to administer your use of the Service, (iii) to better understand your needs and interests, (iv) to personalize and improve your experience, and (v) to provide offers or product announcements.
Geo-Location Information.    Some Devices allow applications to access real-time location-based information (for example, GPS). Our Service may, through your authorization (for example, if you download and use an application on our Service that has GPS or Mapping capabilities), collect GPS information for the purposes of application function. Also, some of the information we collect from a Device, for example IP address, can sometimes be used to approximate a Device’s location.
In addition, some photos and videos you place in smartapp.com may contain recorded location information. We may use this information to optimize your experience. If you do not wish to share files embedded with your geo-location information with us, please do not upload them. If you don’t want to store location data in your photos or videos, please consult the documentation for your camera to turn off that feature.
Analytics.    We also collect some information (ourselves or using third party services) using logging and cookies, such as IP address, which can sometimes be correlated with Personal Information. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Service, for the Service’s technical administration, to increase our Service’s functionality and user-friendliness, and to verify users have the authorization needed for the Service to process their requests.
We use information you and others provide in the Service (for example, through your profile, Files, App Data or through other means in the Service), in an aggregate manner to analyze for the sole purpose of monitoring usage trends of the Service, to improve the Service and offer recommendations to support a positive user experience on smartapp.com.
