You may elect to disclose personal information.
You may disclose personal information when you post content to our websites, in-store technologies or other public forums, such as our Brands’ social media pages, blogs, and online product reviews. Any information that you disclose through these services will become public.
Your personal information will be disclosed in connection with your social sharing activity, such as if you log into your customer account from your social media account. By connecting your customer account and your social media account, you authorise us to share information with your social media account provider, and you understand that the use of the information we share will be governed by the social media site’s privacy policy.
