How Gaastra may share the information Gaastra collects
Gaastra and its affiliated entities share information with each other or with third-party service providers for general business purposes and analytical purposes pursued by Gaastra, such as internal administration, billing, claim handling and services, and providing you or your organization with services.

If Gaastra transfers your personal data to a recipient outside the European Union, it will only do so in compliance with the European General Data Protection Regulation. In these circumstances we will take appropriate steps to ensure that your personal data is adequately protected.
