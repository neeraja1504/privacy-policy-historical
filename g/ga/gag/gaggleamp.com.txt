This Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type or the domain from which you are visiting, the messages you share, the messages you decline, and any reward communication made with the Gaggle Manager. For most users accessing the Internet from an Internet service provider, your IP address will be different every time you log on.

This aggregated information is also made available outside the Gaggle in order to provide overall site demographic information. This aggregate and non-personally identifiable information may be used by GaggleAMP and shared with or sold to third-parties.

Cookies.
A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a user’s computer and the user’s browser provides to the website each time the user returns. GaggleAMP uses cookies to help GaggleAMP identify and track users, their usage of the GaggleAMP Website, and their website access preferences. GaggleAMP visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using GaggleAMP’s website, with the drawback that certain features of GaggleAMP’s Website may not function properly without the aid of cookies.
Do Not Track:
Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. GaggleAMP does not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT.
Information Sharing and Disclosure.
Service Providers. We engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide services to us, including, without limitation, hosting and maintenance, customer relationship, database storage and management, and direct marketing campaigns. We will share your personally identifiable information with these third parties, but only to the extent necessary to perform these functions and provide such services, and only pursuant to binding contractual obligations requiring such third parties to maintain the privacy and security of your data.
Business Transfers.
GaggleAMP may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your personally identifiable information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, or in the event of bankruptcy. You will have the opportunity to opt out of any such transfer if the new entity’s planned processing of your information differs materially from the terms set forth in this Privacy Policy.
Security.
GaggleAMP believes in the privacy of our website users. We safeguard the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information. We employ administrative, physical, and electronic measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access. We will make any legally-required disclosures of any breach of security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically-stored personal data to you via email or conspicuous posting on this Site in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.
