Data Protection Declaration
The protection of your personal data is very important to us. Below we inform you of the
type, method and objective of the collection and processing of your personal data in
connection with the use of this website.
1.   We collect and process personal data giving due consideration to data protection
laws in order to guarantee and optimise our website and for the purpose of
performing the contractual relationship. Your data will not be passed on to third
parties, unless there is a legal obligation to disclose it, e.g. due to a demand made
by a public prosecutor or a judicial order.
2.   As soon as you visit our website or access a file, technical information such as the
browser type and the date and time of the processing request is recorded and
stored anonymously. Evaluating information such as this enables us to continually
improve our website and its user-friendliness.
3.   You also have the option to get in touch with us via the contact form or to enter into
a contractual relationship. The information that you enter in connection with this is
provided by you with your explicit consent. The personal data that we receive from
you will be used exclusively for the purpose for which you have submitted the data
to us, and in order to keep you up to date regarding changes and news in relation
to our offer. You will only be sent electronic and postal advertising material to the
extent permitted by applicable laws. You are entitled to revoke your permission to
process and use your data at any time and free of charge, with effect for future use.
Sending a message to that effect to the address stated on the site notice page will
be sufficient.
4.   Our website also uses cookies. Cookies are files that transmit the web pages you
visit onto your computer for identification purposes, which facilitates navigation for
subsequent visits. Thanks to the cookies, not all required data has to be entered
again with each use. It makes it possible for us to tailor our web pages to your
specific needs. If you do not want cookies to be used, you can refuse acceptance of
cookies in your browser. Please refer to your browser manufacturer’s manual for
detailed information as to how this is done. Please note, however, that the
deactivation may impair the functional scope of our website offer.
5.   Google Analytics: some of our websites use Google Analytics, a web analysis service
of Google Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses so-called “cookies”, small text files
which are stored on your computer and enable the manner in which you have used
the website to be analysed. The information generated by the cookie about your use
of the website (including your IP address) is transmitted to a Google server in the
USA and stored there. Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the
website, to compile reports about the website activities for the operator of the
website and to provide other services connected with the use of the website and the
use of the Internet. Google may also pass this information on to third parties if
need be, if this is required by law or if third parties are processing said data on
behalf of Google. Google shall under no circumstances connect your IP address with
other Google data. You are able to prevent the installation of cookies by setting
your browser software accordingly; however, we must point out to you that if you
do so it is possible that not all functions of this website will be usable to the fullest
extent. By using this website you are declaring your consent to the processing of
the data relating to you collected by Google in the manner and for the purposes
described above. The data collection and use of your IP address can be revoked at
any time with effect for future use tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout. We must
point out to you that on this website the Google Analytics code has been expanded
with the code "gat._anonymizeIp();" and that your IP addresses are therefore only
processed in a shortened format in order to rule out the possibility of a direct link
with your person being established.
6. Facebook: our website links up to the social network Facebook.de, which is
operated by Facebook Inc., 1601. S.California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA. If you

94107. If you use the re-tweet function the website that you have visited will be
disclosed to third parties and will be connected to your twitter account. Detailed
information about twitter’s handling of your data and about your rights and options
for setting your privacy protection can be assigned if you press the “Like” button on
twitter and can be found in Twitter’s data protection information:
