Securing the Transmission and Storage of Information
A-Digi operates secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall and password protection systems.

A-Digi takes steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with our Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed secure.

We treat the information you provide to us as confidential information; it is, accordingly, subject to our company’s security procedures and corporate policies regarding protection and use of confidential information. After personally identifiable information reaches A-Digi it is stored on a server with physical and electronic security features as customary in the industry, including utilization of login/password procedures and electronic firewalls designed to block unauthorized access from outside of A-Digi. Because laws applicable to personal information vary by country, our offices or other business operations may put in place additional measures that vary depending on the applicable legal requirements. Information collected on the sites covered by this Privacy Policy is processed and stored in Cyprus and also in other countries where A-Digi and its service providers conduct business. All A-Digi employees are aware of our privacy and security policies. Your information is only accessible to those employees who need it in order to perform their jobs.
C. USE AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION
How your personal information is used
A-Digi collects your information in order to record and support your participation in the activities you select. We will use your e-mail address to send a confirmation and, if necessary, might use the other information to contact you for help to process the service you have selected. If you subscribe to a service or register a product, for example, the information is used to register your rights, if any, to technical support or other benefits that may be made available to registered users. Your personal information is also used to keep you informed about product upgrades, patches, special offers, and other products and services of A-Digi and selected third parties if you have so opted to receive such communications.
A-Digi may collect information about the use of the Website, such as the types of services used and how many users we receive daily. This information is collected in aggregate form, without identifying any user individually. A-Digi may use this aggregate, non-identifying statistical data for statistical analysis, marketing, or similar promotional purposes.
A-Digi recognizes and appreciates the importance of responsible use of information collected on this Website. Without your consent, A-Digi will not communicate any information to you regarding products, services, and special offers available from A-Digi or its affiliates, although we may find it necessary to communicate with you regarding your use of the services on this Website. Except in the particular circumstances described in this Privacy Policy, A-Digi will also not provide your name to other companies or organizations without your consent.
Disclosure of Information to Third Parties
A-Digi does use the services of third parties, such as e-mail service providers, advertisers and order processing merchants and marketing companies that act as independent contractors on behalf of A-Digi. These parties are contractually prohibited from using personally identifiable information for any purpose other than for the purpose A-Digi specifies. We do provide non-personally identifiable information to certain service providers for their use on an aggregated basis for the purpose of performing their contractual obligations to us. We prohibit the sale or transfer of personal information to entities outside of the A-Digi’s affiliates for their use without your approval.
A-Digi may disclose your personally identifiable information if we believe in good faith that we are required to do so in order to comply with applicable law, a subpoena, or other legal process. A-Digi may also disclose personally identifiable information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Terms of Service, this Privacy Policy or to protect the safety of our users and the public or under confidentiality and licensing agreements with certain third parties which assist us in developing, operating and maintaining the Website and its content.
In the event that all or substantially all of A-Digi’s stock and/or assets are transferred or sold to another entity, A-Digi may transfer personally identifiable information to the acquiring entity. If, as a result of such a business transition, your personally identifiable information will be used in a materially different manner, you will be given choice consistent with our policy regarding notification of changes.
Choices available to you
You can always choose whether or not to disclose personally identifiable information and that choice will not prevent you from using the A-Digi Website. Please note, however, if you should choose to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with some of the services dependent upon the collection of this information.
You can choose at anytime to opt out of receiving emails from A-Digi or from having your personally identifiable information shared with selected companies. If you want to opt out, you can do so by editing your preferences with respect to email or the sharing of information. If you elect to “opt out” we will not, as applicable, share your personal information with third parties or send you emails. However, we may continue to use your personal information for internal purposes, to enhance your user experience or as necessary to administer the site or comply with applicable law.
We reserve the right to send a one-time registration confirmation email, and infrequent Service Alert messages to users to inform them of specific changes that may impact their ability to use a service they have previously signed up for, regardless of email contact opt-in status. We also reserve the right to contact you if compelled to do so as part of a legal proceeding or if there has been a violation of our Terms of Service or applicable licensing agreements.
A-Digi is retaining these rights because in limited cases we feel that we may need the right to contact you as a matter of law or regarding matters that will be important to you. These rights do not allow us to contact you to market a new or existing service if you have asked us not to do so, and issuance of these types of communications are rare.
If you wish to opt out of receiving emails, newsletters, the sharing or retention of any personal identification information, or otherwise change your personal preferences, you must contact A-Digi either by email at [legal@adigi.biz] or regular mail at [A-Digi Europe Limited, 2, Riga Feraiou Street, Limassol Center, Block B, 6th Floor, Office 601, P.C. 3095 Limassol, Cyprus].
To ensure that your request is honored, you must provide A-Digi with information sufficient for us to accurately identify and access your records. The information we require is your full name, address and the email address you provided to A-Digi when you requested services or products. A-Digi reserves the right to contact you to verify that we have accurately identified your record.
