8. California Online Privacy Protection Act
CalOPPA is the first state law in the USA to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website.
According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:
A person can visit our Website anonymously.
Once this Privacy Policy is created, we will add a link to it on our homepage or as a minimum on the first significant page after entering our Website.
Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can be easily be found on the page specified above.
Users will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes on our Privacy Policy page.
Users are able to review and change their Personally Identifiable Information by logging into their Account.

When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. Our website is a general audience site, and we do not specifically market to and do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If you are under 13 years of age, you should not access, view or use this Website, create an account with us, and provide to us any personal information.
