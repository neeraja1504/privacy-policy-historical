GRAB GAMES PRIVACY AND INFORMATION SECURITY POLICY
Effective Date: February 6, 2017
This Privacy and Information Security Policy (“this Policy”) discusses the personally identifying information (“PII”) that we collect about you when you use our website http://www.grabgames.com/ (the “Site”) and the software, games and other services we provide (“Service”).
Who We Are. We are Grab Games LLC (“Grab Games” “Grab,” “GrabGames.com,” “Site,” “Service,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). Grab Games develops and publishes games across platforms. In conducting our business, as further described below, we collect information, including PII, about the individuals who use our Service.
This Policy and the Terms of Use. This Policy is part of and incorporated into the Terms of Use (collectively, the “Terms”).
BY PROVIDING PII OR OTHER INFORMATION TO US OR BY USING OUR SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO THIS POLICY AND THE PRACTICES DESCRIBED IN THE POLICY.
1. INFORMATION YOU GIVE US
1.1 The Types of Information Grab Collects. We collect any information you enter on the Service or provide us in any other way (such as through an email, survey, or letter).
2. AUTOMATIC INFORMATION COLLECTION
2.1 No PII. Grab does not automatically collect any personally identifiable information (PII).
2.2 Cookies & Pixels. Grab reserves the right to place Cookies and Pixel Tags on our owned web sites, including GrabGames.com. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser. We use cookies & pixels to remember your information, to link your activities to you, and for retargeting and remarketing. While you can take steps to warn of, block or disable cookies, if you do, the Service may not function and appear as we have designed it. Nonetheless, if you want to take these steps, you can do so by following the instructions associated with your browser.
2.3 Device Information. Grab may collect information about your current device, such as operating system, device type, manufacturer, and headset, either directly or through a third party.
2.4 IDFA, IDFV, and Advertiser ID. Our mobile games may use mobile device identifiers for install attribution, attributing action, tracking user events, or displaying ads in game, either directly or through a third party service. These are used in accordance to Apple and Google developer policies. You can limit this by following the instructions associated with your device operating system.
2.5 Promotions, Sweepstakes, and Contests. From time to time, we may host a promotion, sweepstake or contest on the Service. You may be asked to provide personal information or permit the transfer to a third party of your personal information in connection with such promotion, sweepstake or contest. It will be disclosed at the point of collection or transfer who is collecting or transferring the information and whose privacy statement applies, and it will be your choice whether or not you wish to permit such transfer to or collection of personal information by a third party.
3. GRAB’S USE AND RETENTION OF YOUR INFORMATION
3.1 Use of PII. We use your PII for such purposes as responding to your requests; monitoring and providing the Service; updates, newsletters, and similar communications about our games and services; enforcing our rights; and investigating and ensuring compliance with the Terms.
3.2 Use of Other Information. We use non-PII for purposes such as measuring the number of visitors to sections of our Site, making the Service more useful to visitors and delivering targeted advertising and non-advertising content. We use non-PII to analyze trends, administer the site, track a user’s movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate, nonpersonally identifiable use.
3.3 Retention of Information. We retain information for as long as required, allowed or we believe it useful, but do not undertake retention obligations. We may dispose of information in our discretion without notice, subject to applicable law that specifically requires the handling or retention of information. You must keep your own, separate back-up records.
4. GRAB’S SHARING OF INFORMATION
Grab shares information with third parties, but only as described in this Section 4.
4.1 Advertisers and Others. We may share non-personally identifiable information with advertisers, service providers, and other persons with whom we conduct business.
4.2 Service Third Parties. We contract with third parties to provide services to us or to you on our behalf. Examples include providing marketing assistance, providing customer services, sending Grab email to you, removing repetitive information from customer lists, and analyzing data. These third parties have access to personal information needed to perform their functions.
4.3 Business Transfer. As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or their assets, or engage in acquisitions, mergers, restructurings, changes of control, or similar transactions. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets, and your PII is subject to such a transfer. Also, in the unlikely event of a bankruptcy, customer information may be transferred to a bankruptcy trustee or debtor in possession and then to a subsequent purchaser.
4.4 Compliance and Safety. We may release PII when we believe release is appropriate to:
(a) comply with applicable law, and to respond to legal process, including subpoenas, search warrants and court orders, and to respond to or otherwise address written complaints of copyright infringement;
(b) make disclosures under programs intended to prevent potential crimes or investigate persons;
(c) enforce or apply agreements, including the Terms; or
(d) protect the rights, property, or safety of Grab, our users, or others, including exchanging information with other companies for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
5. INFORMATION SECURITY
5.1 Your Obligations. You must protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Please sign off when finished using a shared computer. Your e-mails to us are not necessarily secure against interception so do not include sensitive information in them – we generally will not ask for passwords in an email and you should assume that if you get such a request, it might be fraudulent. YOU MUST DO WHAT YOU REASONABLY CAN TO ENSURE THE SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION.
5.2 Our Security Measures. We have physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to help safeguard, prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use your information. HOWEVER, WE DO NOT GUARANTEE SECURITY. Neither people nor security systems are foolproof, including encryption systems. In addition, people can commit intentional crimes, make mistakes or fail to follow policies. If applicable law imposes any non-disclaimable duty (if any), you agree that the standard used to measure our compliance with that duty will be one of intentional misconduct.
6. LINKS
The Service contains links to other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our Site and to read the privacy statements of every website that collects your personally identifiable information. This Policy applies only to information collected by the Service.
7. CONDITIONS OF USE, NOTICES, AND REVISIONS
7.1 Privacy Concerns. Your use of the Service and any dispute over privacy is subject to the Terms. If you have any concern about privacy at Grab, please send us a thorough description by using the contact support form at, and we will try to resolve it.
7.2 Notice Required by Law. In those jurisdictions that permit email notice, if we are required to disclose or provide notice of invasion of certain security systems, we will do so by notifying you through our preferred channels. This may include our websites, social media, or email to the most current email address provided by you to us.
7.3 We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy at anytime. If we do this, we will post the changes on this page and will indicate at the top of this page the date those terms will be effective. We will attempt to give you advance notice of any substantive changes, but reserve the right to make such modifications immediately if required.
