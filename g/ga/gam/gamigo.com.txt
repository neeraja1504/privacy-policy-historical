2. What personal information is collected?
We collect information from you when you register on our website, play online games, order real or virtual goods, respond to a survey or to a communication such as an email, or use other services on our websites. We store that information ourselves or by the use of third parties under contract with us. Those other services may include, for example, the creation of a profile page, participation in forums or the provision of facilities to permit you to post media content such as images and text.
Some of the information that we collect from you is defined as personally identifiable information about an individual, as more particularly described under applicable privacy laws (“Personal Information”). Personal Information may include, without limitation: your name, age, mailing address, email address, telephone number, credit card information and related financial information, information concerning your interests, occupation, product uses and preferences, and other demographic information that could help identify you. If you have set up an account that is password protected in order to play online games, to purchase goods or for any other purpose for which a password is needed, that password is also part of your Personal Information. It may be possible to use portions of gamigo websites without providing any Personal Information, but it will be necessary to provide Personal Information to engage in such activities as ordering real or virtual goods and playing the full subscription version of any gamigo online game.
3. What other types of information may we collect?
For some activities, your web browser or client software may transmit certain geographic information or information regarding your computer to gamigo. gamigo may use that information to generate aggregate statistics about our user community and may provide that information to advertisers and other parties with whom we have a business relationship. In addition, gamigo may use any such information for security, system integrity (the prevention of hacking, cheating and other improper or unlawful activities), or enforcement purposes.
gamigo may also identify and track your Internet protocol (“IP”) address. An IP address is the unique number assigned to your server or internet service provider (“ISP”). gamigo may track those IP addresses for system administration purposes, to report aggregate information, site tracking, security purposes, or to prevent our data and servers from being damaged.
When you visit this a gamigo website to which this privacy policy applies, we may, at our option, automatically collect and store the following types of non-personally identifiable information received from you: (i) information from server logs found on your browser; (ii) click-through statistics; (iii) your country; (iv) the type of web browser you are using to access this website; (v) the type of operating system you are using; (vi) the name of the domain and host from which you access the Internet; (vii) the date and time you access this website and the duration of your visit; and (viii) the Internet address of the site from which you linked directly to this website. Automatically collected information of that kind typically provides us with a greater understanding regarding the use of any of our websites, including which pages are the most popular with our visitors. That information also allows us to determine if a website is working properly and to make changes to the website that allows users to have better experiences on the website. We collect that information and track it for statistical purposes: we do not use it to identify or to market to a particular user.
4. How secure is your Personal Information?
gamigo has taken reasonable steps to provide that all Personal Information collected by us through any website to which this privacy policy applies will remain secure. For example, for credit card information that is transmitted to us, we use industry-standard, SSL (secure sockets layer) encryption. In addition, we take reasonable steps to require that third parties to whom we transfer any data will provide sufficient protection of Personal Information received from us.
You can help us to protect your Personal Information by: (i) using a secure web browser; (ii) not sharing any password or log-in data with others; and (ii) changing your password frequently.

6. What are cookies and how do we use them?
A cookie is a small bit of computer code that we send to your computer and is stored on your hard drive. It allows a website to transfer bits of information to your computer for record-keeping purposes. A cookie stored in your computer can be used to “remember” specific data items such as your password or operational information, such as the fact that you have already subscribed to the full version of a particular online game. That allows us to speed up your future activities, saving the time you would normally spend entering information such as your password or subscription information. In addition, gamigo may use cookies to retrieve user information for promotional, marketing, or security purposes.
7. Does gamigo disclose personal Information it collects to outside parties?
gamigo may provide your Personal Information to other organizations that offer products or services that may be of interest to you. Those third parties may then use that information to offer products and services to you.

We will take reasonable measures to have those third parties maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the Personal Information they obtain from us.
We reserve the right to disclose your Personal Information as required or permitted by law. For example, we may disclose it to respond to a subpoena, court order or other legal process, or in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing Personal Information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against you if we reasonably believe that you may be violating your agreements with us (including, without limitation, any applicable terms of use), or may be causing injury to, or interference with, gamigo, any other user of a gamigo website or service, the general public or other third parties. However, please be aware that gamigo cannot control the activities of third parties to whom we provide data; we therefore cannot guarantee that they will adhere to similar privacy and security procedures as gamigo.
