Data we use with your consent
We collect, store and use your email address, if you have provided your consent, in order to send to you promotional offers and provide marketing for Services that we believe may be of interest to you (see below for details of our marketing communications). We also use your data to offer you other Services which we think may be of interest to you by email where you have given your consent. You can withdraw your consent for these email communications at any time by clicking the “Unsubscribe” button at the bottom of our emails.

You can withdraw your consent for targeted advertising on our apps at any point using the privacy settings available on our apps. (On our websites, you can choose to disable targeted advertising at any point using your privacy settings on our websites. Note however that we will still serve you advertising when you visit or use our websites but this will no longer be tailored to you or your preferences). For more details on our relationship with third party advertising companies, please see the section below titled 'Third party advertising companies'.
Anonymous data
We will also collect anonymised details about visitors to and use of our Services for the purposes of creating aggregate statistics or reporting purposes. However, no single individual will be identifiable from the anonymised details we collect for these purposes.
If you have provided your consent, we may send you marketing communications in relation to our other Services that we think may be of interest to you via email. These messages will only ever be in relation to the named other similar Services of Games2win that you have provided your consent to receive. We do not provide your data to third parties so that they can send you direct marketing communications via email or push notification without first obtaining your consent. Please also see the section below regarding third party advertising for more information about advertising activities on our Services involving third parties.
You can opt-out of receiving any direct marketing communications that we (or any third party to whom we have disclosed your personal information with your consent) may send you by using the unsubscribe mechanism in those marketing emails, or, in relation to push notifications, by choosing not to accept them or by turning them off by visiting the settings on your device and selecting the appropriate setting.
Data Protection
We have implemented appropriate physical, electronic and managerial security procedures to safeguard the data we process from loss, misuse, and alteration and to help prevent unauthorised access, maintain data security and to ensure that we correctly use the data we hold in accordance with the purposes for which we collected that data.
We use industry-standard practices such as encryption, physically secured rooms, firewalls and password protection systems to safeguard the confidentiality of any personal information that we might collect from you. For example, your email address and password will be encrypted which will make it very difficult for someone to discover and use them without our authorisation. We also strive to limit access to your data to employees performing a legitimate business function which requires them to access and use your data in order to supply you with our Services. We review our security procedures periodically to consider appropriate new technology and updated methods to ensure we continue to protect your data.
Whilst we will do our best to protect your data, the transmission of information by you to us over the internet is not completely secure and we cannot guarantee the security of data during its transfer over the Internet to us. Any such transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your data, we will use the procedures and security features outlined in this section to try to prevent any unauthorised access.
Data Retention
We will keep data only for as long as it is relevant and useful for the purpose for which it was originally collected and otherwise where required by law. This means that we will only retain your data for the minimum reasonable time period to allow us to provide our Services to you. If you decide to delete an account you have with us, certain data does stay on our Games2win system for administrative purposes and to defend or bring any legal action. Please email us at  dpo@games2win.com for information regarding retention periods.
Parents/guardians Notice
If you would like to review or amend your child's information, ask to have it deleted, and/or refuse to allow any further collection or use of your child's information, then please send an email to our Data Protection Officer at  dpo@games2win.com . Please be sure to include your email address and a telephone number where we can reach you. To protect your child's privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to help verify your identity before granting you access to the information that we collect and maintain about your child.
We recommend that parents take the time to communicate and educate their children about Internet Safety.
Privacy for Children
Most of our Services are not specifically targeted at children. Where the Services are being used by children under the age of 16, we recommend parents and guardians regularly clear their browser cache and/or browsing history to clear cookies.
For some Services however it may be possible for those under the age of 16 to register an account and access games and other content (with parental or guardian consent). Where children under 16 sign up and use our Services, their account is limited to those aspects of the Services which we deem appropriate for children.
If you are under 16 and have signed up to use any of our Services, we will only collect and process the following limited data about you:
• your date of birth and email address. We collect, use and store this data as it is necessary in order to allow you to log-in and use the Services you have registered for. We need to use your date of birth to make sure that users are not attempting to access Services which we deem inappropriate; and
• data which is necessary to respond to a question or one-off request for customer service support from you. We believe we have a legitimate interest in handling your data for this purpose as it allows us to provide you with customer and technical support and a better experience of our Services and the benefits of this outweigh any potential impact on you in storing and using your personal information in this way.
If you are under the age of 16 and in the EEA, your email address is encrypted. This means that your email address will be put into a secret code, so no one can use it, including us.
As your email address is encrypted, we are not able to contact you by email after registration for any purpose, including to send service emails or promotional offers.
Data Updating or Deletion
If you no longer wish for us to use your data, please get in touch. Please note that this may affect the provision of our Services to you, for example, you may not be able to enter any competitions or make any in game purchases.
You have the right to ask us to amend or update any of your data which is out of date or incorrect, or change the way we may use your data.
You also have the right to ask us to delete any personal information which we are holding about you. You can also object to our processing of data about you, and we will consider any valid objections which you raise. In certain circumstances we may not be able to stop using your personal data but, if that is the case, we'll let you know and tell you why.
If you wish to opt out of receiving any promotional emails or newsletters you can do so by clicking on the "unsubscribe here" link at the bottom of each email. To change or delete push notifications, visit the settings section on your device and select the appropriate setting, or change the settings on your browser if you are accessing any of our websites.
If you have an account with us, in certain games, you can view and edit your profile to change the settings in order to prevent others being able to add you as a friend.
If you wish to exercise any of the above rights, please get in touch with us by emailing  dpo@games2win.com.
Data Copy
You have the right to ask us to provide you with copies of personal data that we hold about you at any time. Please contact us by emailing  dpo@games2win.com
Complaint Escalation
If you are not satisfied with the way your query or complaint is handled by Games2win, please let us know by emailing us at  management@games2win.com. If you are still unhappy, you may refer your complaint to your local data protection regulator.
