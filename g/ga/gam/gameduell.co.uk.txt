1. Protection of personal data
We hold data protection guidelines, especially those outlined in the German Data Protection Law (BDSG), with utmost respect. The German Teleservices Data Protection Act is in place to regulate the collection, processing, and use of personal data by teleservice providers.
In accordance with the regulations outlined in the German Teleservices Data Protection Act, we may only collect, process, and use personal data for which we have been granted legal permission to, for which we have received consent to, or for which is needed for initiating a contractual relationship and is necessary for billing purposes.

In the event that we wish to use or process your personal data for any additional purposes, namely those for which we do not possess a legal permit, then we will acquire your consent. Consent can also be issued via electronic means. When this method is used, we will inform you within the scope of the services we offer. You are, of course, always free to revoke your consent to future use of your personal data. To do so, please send an E-mail to revoke-consent@gameduell.com.
In the event that you have registered with GameDuell via a media partner, then we will regularly ask for your consent to allow us to pass your personal data on to the applicable partner for the purposes of billing and advertising. If you would like to revoke your consent, please send an E-mail to revoke-consent@gameduell.com.
