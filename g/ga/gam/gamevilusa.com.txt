4. Sharing of Your Information
We do not share your personal data with third parties except as explicitly approved by you or except in the following circumstances:
a. Third Party Service Providers. We may provide your information to third party companies (the “Third Party Service Providers”) that perform services on our behalf, including, without limitation, operation of the HIVE platform, data analysis, marketing services, promotional events, email campaigns, hosting services, and customer service or support.  The Third Party Service Providers may access your personal data, but are required to use it solely as directed by us for performing requested services.  We will ask for your consent before we share your data with the Third Party Service Providers.
b. Business Partners. In conjunction with the running of GAMEVIL Games via the HIVE Platform, we are partnering with Com2us Corporation and its affiliates (collectively, the “Business Partners”) in order to:
- assist us in providing maintenance services of the HIVE Platform and enhancing user convenience of the HIVE Platform;

- enable you to receive from the Business Partners any information, newsletter or notification regarding Business Partners’ games provided via the HIVE Platform; and
- enable participation in any promotional event or campaign of such games arranged by the Business Partners.
We may share with our Business Partners the information you provide about yourself, such as (i) your HIVE Account Registration information, (ii) your profile information, (iii) your telephone number, (iv) any technical and usage information we collect, and/or (v) game play information, to the extent that such disclosure may serve the above-mentioned purposes and/or facilitate your use of the HIVE Platform service.

If you wish to no longer have your personal data used by the Business Partners for their marketing purposes, please contact us at privacy@gamevil.com and we will facilitate your request to Business Partners.
c. Advertising of Third Party Products/Services. We will not actively share personal data with third party advertisers (the “Advertisers”) for their direct marketing purposes unless we obtain your consent.  We may share (i) aggregated information (information about you and other users collectively, but not specifically identifiable to you); (ii) anonymous information; and (iii) certain technical information (including IP Addresses, MAC Addresses for mobile devices and mobile device IDs) to develop and deliver targeted advertising in the Advertiser’s website or application.  We may also allow the Advertisers to collect these and similar types of information within the Service and they may share it with us and/or use it for advertising.  The Advertisers may collect this information through the use of a variety of tracking technologies, including without limitation, browser cookies and web beacons.  The information collected may be used to offer you targeted ad-selection and delivery in order to personalize your User experience by ensuring that advertisements for products and services you see will appeal to you, a practice known as behavioral advertising, and to undertake web analytics (i.e. to analyze traffic and other end user activity to improve your experience).  We will ask for your consent before we share your personal data with the Advertisers.

After clicking on one of these advertisements, you will no longer be on a site hosted by us.  To properly credit User accounts and to prevent fraud, a unique identifier will be shared with the offer wall provider.  This identifier is used to ensure proper crediting of your account, prevent fraud or duplicate offers and to resolve any customer service inquiries that may arise.  We will ask for your consent before we share your personal data with the Advertisers.
