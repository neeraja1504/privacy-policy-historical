A cookie is a text file that can be saved in a terminal when consulting an online service with a browser.

enable advertisers to collect more information about the performance of their advertising campaigns and improve over time.
When displaying advertising contents, information relating users browsing – regardless of the terminal (computer, tablet, smartphone) – are likely to be stored in the cookie files installed on the terminal, subject to user agreement.
Personal and contextual data
Personal data are information that help identify directly (name, first name) or indirectly (social security number, customer number, IP address) an individual.

Personal data used by data marketing are of three types : (1) contextual data, linked to user browsing, geolocalisation, and the context of the sites viewed; (2) data owned by the advertiser or « 1st party data » such as CRM databasis; (3) external data or « 3rd party data » provided by specialized third parties, providing data such as user socio-professional category, purchasing intentions or interests. As part of marketing campaigns conducted on behalf of its advertising clients, Gamned! is likely to combine data from different sources, while respecting its clients privacy policies.
Why displaying advertisements adapted to consumer browsing?
Consumers are more likely to show interest in advertising contents that are targeted for them according to their needs and preferences. As a matter of fact, our clients also want to advertise to audiences that are actually interested in what they have to offer.
Moreover, revenues from advertising enable users to enjoy free access to online contents and services.
