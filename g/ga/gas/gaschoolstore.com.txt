We may use cookies to identify you when you visit us and to keep track of where you go so we can provide you with more personalized service by way of our web sites.

Cookies do not contain any personally identifiable information. You can use your browser settings to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. If you turn off cookies, you will not have access to some of the features on our web sites, and some of our services may not function properly.
We may also request your username, email address and telephone number if you submit a form through the “Contact Us” portion of our web site so that we may respond to the inquiry. We collect the email content, email address and phone number for the sole purpose of responding directly on a one‑time basis to a specific inquiry. We may retain this information for customer service purposes.
When you order online or subscribe to any of our web sites, we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself to facilitate the transaction.

Great American will store this information only if necessary and will do so in accordance with Payment Card Industry standards.
In addition, such necessary information very well may be stored by our payments processing vendor(s) for the purpose of processing payments, collection efforts, and for fraud prevention purposes.

We will not ask children for personal information. It is up to a child’s parent(s) or lawful guardian to inform Great American of the information we should obtain, store and use about their children. As Great American makes available subscription sites and online stores for children, you should take responsibility for registering the child on the applicable web site and provide correct information about the child, including the child’s name, email address, username, age, telephone number and password, if necessary to gain access to the subscribed service. It is not our intent or wish to collect any such information directly from a child so we ask that you monitor and manage your child’s use of our online stores, subscription services, and web sites. Let us know of good suggestions you may have to help us make our websites even safer and more user-friendly for children.
