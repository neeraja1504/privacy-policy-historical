Privacy Statement
Last Updated May 30, 2018
Protection of personal privacy has always been a hallmark of Gallup. Since its inception in 1935, Gallup has maintained the confidentiality of each survey respondent unless an individual user consents to the release of the user's Personal Information or individual results. In a similar manner, Gallup protects the identity of individuals who access Gallup Websites. For the purposes of this Privacy Statement, the terms " Gallup, we, us, and our " refer to Gallup, Inc., 901 F Street, NW, Washington, D.C., 20004, U.S.A. and its subsidiaries and affiliates.
Gallup's data protection officer can be contacted at Privacy_Administrator@Gallup.com.
This statement describes the types of information, including Personal Information, collected and processed through Gallup websites and through the services delivered via Gallup websites, and how Gallup treats such information. For questions about this Privacy Statement or your Personal Information, please contact Privacy_Administrator@Gallup.com .
Personal Information
By using the term " Personal Information " in our Privacy Statement, we refer to information that you individually provide to Gallup either directly or indirectly that on its own or in combination with other information, can be used to identify you or make you identifiable. Personal Information includes for example your name, your mailing address, your telephone number, your e-mail-address or other information that identifies you or makes you identifiable.
Information that by itself cannot be used to identify you or make you identifiable does not qualify as Personal Information.
I. INFORMATION COLLECTED BY GALLUP WEBSITES
Gallup websites gather information in two ways: (1) indirectly (for example, through our site's technology), and (2) directly (for example, when you, the site visitor, voluntarily provide information on various pages).
The information will be transferred to Gallup Inc.'s servers located in the United States of America ("USA"). Gallup has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the U.S. Privacy Shield Principles. In accordance with Article 45 of the European General Data Protection Regulation (" GDPR ") the European Commission recognizes that the certification under the EU-U.S.-Privacy Shield ensures an adequate level of data protection, so that the data transfer to the USA does not require any specific authorization (see also below clause III. 7 "Compliance and Cooperation with Regulatory Authorities").
1. Information Collected Indirectly
Gallup indirectly collects a variety of information through your interaction with and use of Gallup websites. This information may include, but is not limited to, browser and device information, data collected through automated electronic interactions, application usage data, content information based on your individual interests, demographic information, geographic or geo-location information, statistical and aggregated information (" Other Information ").
Statistical or aggregated information does not directly identify a specific person, but it may be derived from Personal Information. For example, we may aggregate Personal Information to calculate the percentage of users in a particular zip code.
If we combine Other Information with Personal Information, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information.
1.1 Gallup Cookies
Some types of indirectly collected information are stored in " cookies." Cookies are small files of electronic information that a website can transfer to a visitor's hard drive to help that visitor while on the site. There are different types of cookies:
Strictly necessary cookies are required for the operation of our website.
Functionality cookies are used to recognize you when you return to our website. These cookies simply store a user code so that the user does not have to re-enter their information when re-joining the site.
Targeting cookies record your visit on our platform and the pages you have visited. We will use this information to make our website more relevant to your interest.
The use of cookies is standard on the Internet. Although most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, the decision of whether to accept or not is yours. You have the choice to accept or decline cookies by way of consent. You may adjust your browser settings to prevent the reception of cookies, or to provide notification whenever a cookie is sent to you. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser. However, please note that if you do this, you may not be able to access the full functionality of Gallup Websites. Cookies placed by Gallup will expire when the user terminates the website session or after a reasonable period of inactivity. Please find the list of all the cookies we use here.
1.1. a. Tracking Data and Third Party Analytics Providers
Website traffic volume and patterns, such as the number of visitors to a given website or page on a daily basis is typically referred to as Tracking Data. This type of indirectly collected information is gathered through various means, such as an IP address, which is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web. Web servers, the computers that "serve up" Web pages, automatically identify your computer by its IP address. When you visit any Gallup Websites, our servers log your computer's IP address.
To obtain these Tracking Data, Gallup uses third party analytics providers (" Third Party Analytics Providers "). The Third Party Analytics Providers use cookies to help us analyze how users use Gallup websites. The information generated by the cookie about your use of Gallup websites, including your IP address, will be transmitted to and stored by Third Party Analytics Providers' servers. On behalf of Gallup, the Third Party Analytics Providers will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of Gallup websites, compiling reports on website activity, and providing other services relating to website activity. The Third Party Analytics Providers will not associate your IP address with any other data held by them. This processing is necessary for the purpose of Gallup's legitimate interests in accordance with Art. 6 (1) 1 lit. f) GDPR, in particular, to ensure the proper functioning of our website.
For the abovementioned purpose Gallup uses the following Third Party Analytics Providers: Google Analytics, Selligent, Oracle, Dynatrace and Zendesk. The list includes information about the use of each cookie, how to prevent the collection and use of information collected by the cookie.
One of our Third Party Analytic Providers is Google Analytics :
Google Analytics is a service from Google, Inc. (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA; hereinafter "Google") using cookies which are saved on your computer. The information generated by the cookie is transferred to and stored on a Google server (generally) located in the USA. Google uses this information on our behalf in order to analyze the use of our websites. The IP address transferred from your browser through Google Analytics is not merged with other data by Google for profiling purposes.
You can prevent Google Analytics' collection and use of data (cookies and IP address) by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available here. Gallup uses IP anonymization, which truncates/anonymizes the last octet of the IP address for Member States of the European Union as well as for other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases is the full IP address sent to and shortened by Google servers in the USA.
Further information can be found in the Google Analytics Terms of Service.
Only designated administrators of Gallup can access the information gathered by Google Analytics, and the information is used only for administrative and planning purposes to meet the needs of our users, such as to improve the content of the site and to customize the content and/or layout of the site for individuals or groups of users.
b. Cookies for advertising
We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These companies may use cookies and action tags to measure advertising effectiveness. You can still decide whether you want to accept these cookies by way of consent. You may adjust your browser settings to prevent the reception of third-party cookies, or to provide notification whenever such third-party cookies are sent to you. If you do not accept these cookies, we will not be able to show you personalized content and ads.

1. Access to your Survey or Assessment Results from Another User Account
Another online user may purchase an access code to a Gallup survey or assessment for you. Please note that when participating in a survey or assessment, your results will also be accessible to the online user who purchased the Gallup access code. The data accessible to that account holder may include your name and your results, but will not include your specific answers to individual questions within the survey or assessment. In addition, the account holder cannot modify, alter, or delete any of your results or User Account data.
After completion of the survey or assessment, you will at all times have the opportunity to change the settings for sharing your results with other account holders and opt-out from sharing your results.
