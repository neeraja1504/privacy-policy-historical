However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.
How Is Such Information Used?
We use the data that you provide or we collect to provide you the services offered on our Service. INDIEGALA uses your email address to email you a link to your game download page and to notify you of future INDIEGALA promotions if the "Notify me about future INDIEGALAs" checkbox is checked. INDIEGALA uses the data you enter on the Service, such as the price you enter and your slider positions, to make sure that your contributions go to the right places. INDIEGALA uses browser data like which operating system you are using to improve user-experience by making your download page default to the game builds corresponding to your current operating system. INDIEGALA may use the site data collected to produce general and anonymous statistics about consumer behavior. We use cookies to improve our Service and make it easier to use. Cookies permit us to recognize users and avoid repetitive requests for the same information. Cookies from our Service can not be read by other sites. Most browsers will accept cookies until you change your browser settings to refuse them. We may use certain information about you internally for purposes such as analyzing how the Service is used, diagnosing service or technical problems, maintaining security, and personalizing content.
Is The Information Shared or Disclosed?
INDIEGALA does not sell or share the information it collects hereunder except as described in this Privacy Policy. Information collected from you is disclosed and used to complete and support your purchases from and use of the INDIEGALA Service and to comply with any requirements of law. For example, we may disclose information to third party payment processors. We may also disclose information to third party social networks at your direction, e.g. when you "tweet" or "like" something on the Service. From time to time, we may run contests, special offers, or other events or activities ("Events") on the Service together with a third party partner. If you provide information to such third parties, you give them permission to use it for the purpose of that Event and any other use that you approve. We cannot control third parties' use of your information. If you do not want your information to be collected by or shared with a third party, you can choose not to participate in these Events. INDIEGALA may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on INDIEGALA or the Service; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of INDIEGALA; or (3) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of INDIEGALA, its web sites or the public. If INDIEGALA or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that INDIEGALA goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of INDIEGALA may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.
