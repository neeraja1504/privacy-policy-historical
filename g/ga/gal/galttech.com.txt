Galt Technology, Inc. is committed to protecting the privacy of Internet users. This Privacy Statement presents our privacy policy for our websites. By using or accessing our web site, you agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, your only recourse is to not use our web site.
For each visitor to our sites, our Web server automatically recognizes your domain, the type of Internet browser you are using, the type of computer operating system you are using, and the domain name of the Web site from which you linked to our site. Most web browsers also identify your IP address and ISP, from which geographic location can be deduced.
When you click on links and/or ad banners that take you to third-party web sites, you will be subject to the third parties' privacy policies. While we support the protection of privacy on the Internet, we cannot be responsible for the actions of third parties. We encourage you to read the posted privacy statement whenever interacting with any web site.
Third-Party Ad Servers and Statistics:
Some of our advertisers use third-party advertising companies to serve their ads on our sites. These third-party advertising companies employ cookie technology to measure ad effectiveness. To do so, these companies may use information about your visits to our sites and other Web sites. Use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies. Most web browsers allow you to accept or decline the placement and access of cookies on your device, so you have the option of disabling or deleting cookies if you choose.
Specifically, some ads that appear on our site are served by a third party under the Google AdSense program. As such, all issues regarding privacy related to these ads (including use of cookies and web beacons to gather information such as IP address, ISP, geographic location, browser, how to opt-out, etc.) are governed by Googleâ€™s privacy policy, which can be viewed here.
Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our site. Google's use of the Doubleclick DART cookie enables it to serve ads to our users based on their visit to our site and other sites on the Internet. Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy.
Information We Gather:
Except as described above, we will not collect any personally-identifiable information about you (name, address, telephone number) unless you volunteer that information to us in the course of subscribing to one of our lists or ordering a product. If you do not want your personal information collected, please do not submit it. We do not knowingly gather personal information from users less than 13 years old.

If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on this page. It is your responsibility to review and understand the Policy and any changes made to it. Continuing to use the site indicates your acceptance of the then-current Policy, including any changes.
