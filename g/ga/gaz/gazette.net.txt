We currently contract with online partners to help us manage and optimize our Internet business and communications. We use these online partners to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our site. To do this, we use Web beacons and cookies provided by the online partners on this site, and all Post-Newsweek Media, Inc. sites. By supplementing our records, this information helps us learn things like what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which of our advertisements most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see. Although the online partners measure the information coming from our site on our behalf, we control how that data may and may not be used. Through the online partners, we do not collect your private information, such as name or street address, or email address.
We may from time to time ask our readers to provide personal information for the purpose of online contests, subscription requests and renewals, event registrations and e-newsletter subscriptions. We occasionally request additional information -- such as street addresses and phone numbers -- to facilitate customer service and correct delivery problems.
We respect your right to privacy. We will not share personal information such as your name, e-mail address, street address, or email address with third parties unless you have given us permission to share that information.
We use the information you provide in the following ways:
We make changes to your delivery information, such as address.
We send Gazette.Net e-newsletters to your e-mail address.
We deliver announcements of new or upcoming Gazette.Net events to your e-mail address.
