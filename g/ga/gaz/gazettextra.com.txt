PRIVACY POLICY
We believe you have a right to know what personal information is collected during your visits to Bliss sites and how the information is used and safeguarded. You can view some of our content anonymously, but circumstances exist when information about you is collected. The information gathered falls into two categories: information you supply voluntarily and information we gather through technology.
Information you supply voluntarily
To use certain features and services on Bliss sites, you may be asked to provide specific information about yourself. This information is collected when you fill out a browser-based form and is necessary to make the features useful and valuable. The forms have blank spaces into which you type the information. We collect information, including but not limited, your name, email address, telephone number, birth date and mailing address.
How we use information you supply voluntarily
We use the information you voluntarily supply to develop and offer content that best suits your interests, to complete transactions, or to communicate with you. For example, if you purchase a print subscription, we use your information to process your order. If you contact us for help, we use the information to contact you with a resolution to your problem or answer to your question. If you enter a contest, we use the information to determine eligibility and to contact winners.
Information gathered through technology
Technology helps us gather other information. Our web servers automatically collect information about your computer's connection to the Internet, including your IP address, which is usually associated with the place from which you enter the Internet. You likely enter the Internet through your Internet service provider, your company or your school. Your IP address does not identify you personally. Your email address is not collected through this process, and no data on your hard drive or personal or institutional servers are read.
We also collect aggregate information on how many people visit our sites and what pages people access on our sites. Some of this information is gathered using a standard feature of browser software called a "cookie." A cookie cannot read data on your hard drive or server or gather other personal information about you such as your name or email address. Aggregate information is processed by third party services: Omniture and Google Analytics.
How we use information gathered through technology

Sharing information with other parties
Personal information you voluntarily provide is used for internal purposes only and is not shared with or sold to other businesses or organizations. Use of certain interactive features, such as commenting on a news article, implies your permission to share your information. Situations where permission is implied are clearly labeled on the browser-based forms. We will share personal information with law enforcement officials as required under subpoena or court order to protect the safety and security of our sites, our visitors and the community. We do share aggregated statistics on site visits and page views with advertisers, as well as audience profiles.
