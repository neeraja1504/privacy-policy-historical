From the processing of the IP address and other information in the log file, we can not draw any direct conclusions about your identity.
Only authorised personnel who are responsible for the management of the servers are authorised to access the data. As no personal assignment takes place, the data records for the statistical evaluation are kept in anonymous form by deleting the last digit sequence of the IP address.
Specific personal data, such as email addresses, first name, name, telephone number or address, are requested for separate services and activities. A request for personal data will be applicable especially when you register to access our website, when you request to use a special service and when you take part in a prize competition.
