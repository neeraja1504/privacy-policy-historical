{{formPostErrorMessage.message}} [{{formPostErrorMessage.code}}]
Privacy Commitment
We have a Global Privacy Policy that has been implemented across all Cengage Learning Companies, that protects all the Personal Information we receive from you as well as information we receive from schools and other third parties. It protects information collected online as well as offline.
This Program and Policy set the standards for Cengage both as a Controller (for its own data) and as a Processor (for its clients).  Additionally, we have updated our Privacy Program controls to address new requirements under GDPR. For more information, please read our complete Notice, linked to below or contact privacy@cengage.com.
If you are an educator, parent or student, Cengage Learning is a service provider to your school or organization; please reach out to the appropriate contact at your school or organization with questions or inquiries. This notice does not cover other organizations' sites that may be accessible via links on our sites. These sites have their own privacy policies and we encourage you to read them.
We also want our privacy practices to be very clear, so you can interact with us in confidence. The statements and links below may answer your questions about how we handle your Personal Information. For a complete notice, view the Cengage Privacy Notice. If you have any other questions, please contact us.
Privacy Program Highlights
We do not allow any children under 13 to register with Cengage, and we do not knowingly collect or use any Personal Information pertaining to children under 13 for our own purposes.  If you believe that a child under 13 years of age has provided Personal Information to us, please contact privacy@cengage.com so that we may delete the information and take other appropriate steps to the protect the child.
We have websites that enable parents and teachers to create accounts for children. We encourage parents and teachers to spend time online with children and to monitor their online activities.
We also provide digital products for use by children in K-12 schools, sometimes done  through LMS integrations, but we only collect and process information pertaining to these children as a processor for the educational institutions.  We do not use identifiable K-12 student information for our own purposes.  Additionally, many student records are protected by the Family and Educational Rights Privacy Act (FERPA). For information on your K-12 school’s privacy policies, please contact the administration.
