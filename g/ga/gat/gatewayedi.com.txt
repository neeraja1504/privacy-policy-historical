Uses of Information Submitted and Collected
During your use of the Web Site we will collect certain information from you. For each visitor to the Web Site, TriZetto's servers automatically collect information about which pages you visit and your IP address or domain name. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, to more efficiently administer our Web Site and to gather broad demographic information.

TriZetto will not sell your personally-identifying information (your email address and any contact information you provide), but reserves the right to share certain demographic and profile data with business partners solely on an aggregated basis.
TriZetto will disclose your personally-identifying information only in special cases, such as (i) to comply with valid legal requirements, such as a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena or court order; or (ii) when TriZetto has reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who, intentionally or unintentionally, may be causing injury or harm to TriZetto.com users or other persons or violating the Terms and Conditions of Use for this Web Site.
Cookies
TriZetto may place a "cookie" on the browser of your computer. Cookies are pieces of information that a web site transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. The use of cookies is common in the Internet industry, and many major web sites use them to provide useful features to their customers. The cookie itself does not contain any personally-identifying information, but may be used to tell when your computer has contacted TriZetto.com. TriZetto uses the information for editorial purposes and to customize delivery of information specific to your interests.

This Privacy Policy may be revised over time as new features are added to the Web Site or as Internet security and privacy standards evolve. We will post those changes prominently so you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information and whether we will disclose it to anyone.
