When this notice applies
Our sites
This notice applies to personal data we collect, including through our websites, mobile apps, online portals, electronic forms, surveys, and interactive exhibits (collectively, “our sites”).
Supplemental privacy notices
This notice may be supplemented by a supplemental privacy notice applicable to a particular interaction with us, which may be either embedded in this notice (such as the Supplemental Privacy Notice for Job Applicants and Supplemental Privacy Notice for Event Participants) or made available to you separately. We will tell you when a supplemental privacy notice applies.
Links to third-party sites
This notice does not apply to any third-party sites that may link to, or be accessible from, our sites. Your interactions with these sites are governed by the third parties’ applicable privacy notices, statements, or policies. We encourage you to read them.
What data we collect about you
Data you provide about yourself
We collect your personal data when you voluntarily provide it to us. For example, you may give us: your email address, country of residence, and areas of interest if you choose to receive newsletters, updates, or other information from us; your contact information, and any other personal data you choose to include, if you email, text, or instant message us, or contact us through our sites; and any personal data contained in, or included with, any proposal documents, feedback, comments, photos, videos, or other information you submit via online portals, forms, surveys, or interactive portions of our sites.
It is always your choice whether to provide this personal data. However, some personal data must be provided to participate in certain programs, activities, or events (such as to sign up for a newsletter, apply for a job, or register to participate in one of our events), so the decision not to provide information might limit or eliminate certain functions of our sites or your ability to participate. Please do not disclose more personal data than is requested.
Personal data you provide about others
Do not provide personal data about others unless you are authorized or required to do so by contract or applicable law. You may provide personal data on behalf of another person if you have provided them with a copy of this notice and any applicable supplemental privacy notice, and obtained their explicit consent. We may ask you to provide evidence of that notice and consent.
Data we receive from third parties and other sources
We may receive personal data about you from other sources, including your company/organization, professional references, publicly-available sources, third-party analytics providers, and other third parties. For example, we may receive your personal data if: someone at your company/organization designates you as a contact person for that company/organization or includes information about you in proposal documents; another visitor includes it in any feedback, comments, photos, videos, or other information submitted via online portals, electronic forms, surveys, or interactive portions of our sites; or one of our employees or service providers provides or a third party acting on apparent authority provides it to us when registering you to access our facilities or our sites, apply for a job, or participate in one of our events.
Data we collect automatically, including cookies and similar technologies
We may collect some personal data automatically. For example, when you visit a foundation site, we may collect your Internet Protocol (IP) address, Internet service provider (ISP), and browser type and language. We also may use cookies and similar technologies to collect data about your interaction with our sites, including referring webpage, pages visited on our sites, and crash data. Please see Cookies & Similar Technologies for more information, including how to manage cookies and similar technologies.
Special categories of data
We will not intentionally collect any “special categories of data” under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) without your explicit consent for one or more specified purposes or as otherwise permitted or required by applicable law. Special categories of data include personal data (a) revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership; or (b) concerning health or data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation.
Minors
Our sites are not intended for minors (individuals under the age of 13, or equivalent minimum age depending on jurisdiction), and we do not knowingly collect personal data from minors. If you become aware of any personal data we have collected from a minor, please contact us. If we learn that we have collected personal data from a minor, we will take steps to delete the data without notice as soon as possible.
How we use your data
Purposes
We may use your personal data to: send you information you have expressly chosen to receive [with your consent] ; review and respond to proposal documents, feedback, comments, photos, videos, or other information you submit via online portals, electronic forms, surveys, or interactive portions of our sites [for our legitimate interests and/or to perform a contract with you] ; administer and inform our program strategies and charitable activities [for our legitimate interests] ; administer, safeguard, and improve our sites, systems, facilities, events, and other business operations [for our legitimate interests] ; protect our rights and the safety of others [for our legitimate interests] ; contribute to our archive of information in the public interest [for our legitimate interests] ; and/or comply with applicable law, court order, subpoena, or legal process served on us [to comply with legal obligations].
Additional purposes
Additional purposes for using your personal data may be described in a supplemental privacy notice.
Legal bases under the GDPR
If you are in the European Union, we will collect and use your personal data only if we have one or more legal bases for doing so under the GDPR. The legal bases depend on your interaction with us and our sites. This means we collect and use your personal data only where: you have given your consent for one or more specific purposes; it is necessary to perform a contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you; it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests; it is necessary to protect the vital interests of you or another natural person; or it is necessary to comply with a legal obligation. We will indicate in brackets the legal basis or bases on which we are relying following each purpose. Where we are relying on consent as the legal basis, we will notify you and seek additional consent before using your personal data for a new purpose that is inconsistent with the original purpose for which we collected it.
When we share your data
Employees, agents, affiliates, service providers, and partners
We may share your personal data with our employees, agents, and affiliates who have a business need to know, our services providers (including contingent workers, consultants, contractors, vendors, and out-sourced service providers) to process it for us based on our instructions and for no other purpose, and with partners that are collaborating with us to fund projects or host events. We do not share your personal data with any third party (including our service providers) for marketing purposes. If you believe personal data you provided to us is being misused by a third party, please contact us right away.
Other visitors to our sites
If you submit feedback, comments, photos, videos, or other information to interactive portions of our sites, such submission may be made publicly available to anyone who visits those areas of our site. Other visitors may access, re-post, or use such submission. Even if you remove or delete your submission, copies may remain in cached or archived areas of our sites or retained by other visitors. Please use your discretion when submitting personal data in these contexts.
Law enforcement
We may share your personal data with law enforcement, other government agencies or authorities, or third parties as required by applicable law, court order, subpoena, or legal process served on us.
How we store and protect your data
Storage and transfers
Your personal data may be stored in your region or in any other country where we or our service providers have facilities. We may also allow employees and service providers located around the world to access personal data as provided in this notice. If you are in the European Union, we will ensure your legal rights and protections travel with any such “transfer” of your personal data outside the European Economic Area, Switzerland, or Canada. We do this by signing “standard contractual clauses” approved by the European Commission that give personal data the same protection it has in the European Union, and/or requiring that our service providers be certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework or Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework, as applicable.
Storage period
We will store your personal data until it is no longer needed to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected or as otherwise required or permitted by law. After such time, we will either delete or anonymize your personal data or, if this is not possible, we will securely store your personal data and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible. We may dispose of any data in our discretion without notice, subject to applicable law. Please contact us if you would like more details regarding our retention periods for different categories of personal data.
Protection
As the transmission of data via the internet is not completely secure, we cannot guarantee the security of your information transmitted to our sites and any such transmission is at your own risk. However, we maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures, including performing regular self-assessments, to prevent unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, personal data. We limit access to personal data and require that employees authorized to access personal data maintain the confidentiality of that data. We hold our service providers to at least the same data privacy and security standards to which we hold ourselves. Our standard information security requirements for service providers are available here: www.gatesfoundation.org/InformationSecurityRequirements.pdf.
How you can access and control your data
Access and control
Generally, newsletters, auto-generated emails, and updates from us will include links to access, correct, or delete your personal data and to manage any subscriptions directly. If you wish to obtain confirmation that we hold personal data about you, access, correct, or delete your personal data, withdraw any consent you previously provided to us, or object to or restrict our processing of it in any other context, please contact us. We will respond to all legitimate requests within 30 days.
Other rights
To the extent provided by applicable laws (including the GDPR), you also may have the right to have the data or content deactivated, blocked, anonymized, or deleted, as appropriate, request and receive a copy of the personal data you have provided us and to transmit this data to a third party, and lodge a complaint with the applicable data protection authority. To exercise any of these rights that you are not able to do directly, please contact us.

BILL & MELINDA GATES FOUNDATION SUPPLEMENTAL PRIVACY NOTICE FOR JOB APPLICANTS
Last updated May 17, 2018 Update history
This notice supplements our Privacy & Cookies Notice and describes how we collect, use, share, and retain additional personal data when you participate in our job application process, and how you can access and control this additional data. Please let us know if you have any questions about this supplemental notice.
What additional data we collect about job applicants
Data you provide about yourself
When you participate in our job application process, we will ask you to provide personal data such as: your name, email address, mailing address, and telephone number; your resume/CV, work experience, educational history, and skills; links to any relevant websites or your LinkedIn profile; whether you are legally authorized to work in the country in which the position is located; whether you will require sponsorship to obtain legal authorization; whether you are 18 years or older; and whether you are currently working for a grantee of ours. In addition, we will ask you to voluntarily provide information regarding your gender, veteran status, ethnicity, and disability status. This information, or your decision not to provide this information, will not impact your application in any way.
Before uploading a resume, please remove any sensitive personal data such as government-issued ID numbers, financial information, photos, dates of birth, etc. We do not need or want that data in a resume.
Data we receive from other sources
We may receive personal data about you from other sources, your references, prior employers, a person or company/organization authorized by you to submit an application on your behalf, and/or publicly-available sources.
Data we collect from consumer reports or consumer investigative reports
If we think there might be a good fit for a position, we may ask you to authorize us to obtain a consumer report or consumer investigative report. A consumer report is a report bearing on credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, general reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living which is expected to be used or collected to serve as a factor in establishing an applicant’s eligibility for employment. An investigative consumer report tends to be the same thing but the information is obtained through personal interviews with neighbors, friends, associates, or acquaintances. Both kinds of reports may include information from court, administrative, and criminal records if and to the extent permitted by applicable law. If you choose not to provide this authorization upon request, we will not be able to offer you employment.

If you are hired as a foundation employee, this information may be used for additional employment and business purposes subject to any internal privacy policies and notices. [for our legitimate interests and/or to perform a contract with you].
Sensitive personal data
We believe our employees should reflect the rich diversity of the global populations we aim to serve, and we support this diversity through all our employment practices. Accordingly, we ask applicants to provide information regarding their gender, veteran status, and ethnicity. If you choose to provide this information, we will keep it separate from your application and use it solely for the purpose of monitoring, informing, and reporting on our diversity efforts [for our legitimate interests].
When we share this additional data
We may share your personal data with service providers (including Workday, Inc., recruiters, and other third parties) that assist us with recruiting, application, and employment processes and our affiliates and other third parties with whom you might work if you are offered and accept the job.
How long we keep this additional data
We store personal data of all applicants in accordance with the Privacy & Cookies Notice. If you accept a job with us, we may retain your application and any other information we relied on during the application process as part of your employee file. Please note that we have the right to delete accounts and application information at any time, so you may want to retain copies of any information, including resumes/CVs, you provide to us during the application process.
How you can access and control this additional data
You may update your contact information anytime by going directly to your account. If you wish to access or correct other personal data, or object to our data processing, please contact us. Please note that neither changes to, or deletion of, such personal data will alter personal data already relied upon or no longer in our control.
