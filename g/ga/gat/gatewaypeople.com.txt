Introduction
The EU General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") was enacted in the European Union on May 25, 2018, and contained many significant changes to the data protection laws. Based on protecting privacy and taking a risk-based approach, the GDPR has been designed to meet the requirements of the digital age.
Thank you for choosing to be part of Gateway Church ("company", "Church", "we", "us", or "our"). We are committed to protecting your personal information and your right to privacy, and to providing a compliant and consistent approach to data protection. We have always had a robust and effective data protection program in place which complies with existing law and abides by the data protection principles. However, because of the international reach of our church and its associated ministries we are updating and expanding our program to meet the demands of the GDPR.
We are dedicated to safeguarding the personal information under our control and in developing a data protection program that is effective and demonstrates an understanding of, and appreciation for the GDPR. Our preparation and objectives for GDPR compliance have been summarized in this statement and include the development and implementation of new data protection roles, policies, procedures, controls and measures to ensure maximum and ongoing compliance.
If you have any questions or concerns about our Policy or our practice, please contact us at appsupport@gatewaypeople.com.
This Privacy Policy (the "Privacy Policy" or "Policy") applies to all information collected through our website, mobile application, ("Apps"), and/or any related services, sales, marketing or events (we refer to them collectively in this Privacy Policy as the "Sites").
