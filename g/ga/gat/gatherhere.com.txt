Your Information
We may collect two basic types of information, personal information and anonymous information — and we may use personal and anonymous information to create a third type of information — aggregate information. Personal and anonymous information may be collected directly from our users and prospective users, including when our users or prospective users communicate with us, create user accounts, and/or transact with us through our website located at GatherHere.com (our “site”). We define “personal information” as information that is unique to an individual. Personal information might include the following: your name, age, mailing address, zip code, contact information, and demographic information. We may collect certain information (e.g., name or gender) actively from users within our site and other information passively (e.g., ip address). We will update your information whenever we can to keep it current, accurate and complete.
Our Use of Your Information
If we do collect your personal information, we will only use it for the purposes stated when the information was collected and as described further in this policy.
We will not sell, license, transmit or disclose your personal information outside of Gather Technologies unless:
you expressly authorize us to do so;
the disclosure is necessary to allow our service providers or agents to provide services for us;
the disclosure is necessary in order to contact you or for us to provide our products or services to you;
subject to applicable contractual or legal restrictions, the information is disclosed to entities that perform marketing services on our behalf or to other entities with whom we have joint marketing agreements;
subject to applicable contractual or legal restrictions, the disclosure is in connection with a sale of all or substantially all of our assets or the merger of Gather Technologies into another entity, or any consolidation, share exchange, combination, reorganization, or like transaction in which Gather Technologies is not the survivor;
disclosure is necessary in connection with other business purposes including, without limitation, customer care, service quality, business management and operation, risk assessment, security, fraud and crime prevention/detection, monitoring, research and analysis, marketing, customer purchasing preferences and trends, dispute resolution, credit checking and debt collection; or
otherwise as we are required or permitted by law.
We may also use personal information to prepare aggregate information, such demographic statistics. We may share this aggregate information with our merchant partners or for other business purposes.
