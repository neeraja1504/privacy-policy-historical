However, some features of the Services will not function properly if cookies are disabled, deleted or refused.
We may use other technology, such as clickstreams to, through and from our Services and web beacons (also sometimes called pixel tags or transparent GIFs) to, among other things, track use of our Services, and habits and preferences of our visitors. We also may use such technologies to collect information regarding your interaction with email messages, such as whether you opened, clicked on, or forwarded a message.
During some visits we may use software tools such as JavaScript to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away from the page.
We use this information to improve the Services by assessing how many users access or use our Services, which content, products, and features of our service most interest our visitors, what types of offers our customers like to see, and how our service performs from a technical point of view.
We work with Google Analytics, which uses cookies and similar technologies to collect and analyze information about use of the Website and report on activities and trends.

In addition, we may have relationships with partner websites and advertising companies that allow those companies to use cookies and other internet technology such as web beacons to track your interactions with our Services and email communications. These companies may combine this information with information about your visits to other sites and services for their use, and we may receive information from these companies about your use of our Services and third party websites.

You should think carefully before disclosing any Personal Information in any public forum.
We may also share Personal Information with our selected suppliers, service providers and partner websites in order to facilitate providing the Services to you including selling products to you.

We may also share de-identified information with other companies for marketing purposes, such as to display effectiveness of targeted advertising with or in our Services or the websites or services of other companies. This information may include aggregated information such as usage statistics or demographic trends regarding our users or those of websites or services with which we have a business relationship. It may also include de-identified information regarding particular users of our Services, such as information about websites or pages visited by the particular user.
We may share Personal Information where you have consented to share that information for specific purposes. For example, you may choose to allow us to share Personal Information with our partners when you enter a contest. You may also choose to share Personal Information with our partners for marketing purposes (e.g., to send you their offers).
