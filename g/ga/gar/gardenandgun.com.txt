Privacy Policy – Garden & Gun
WEBSITE PRIVACY STATEMENT
Welcome to the Website for Garden & Gun, www.gardenandgun.com. This site is owned by Garden & Gun Magazine, LLC. We at Garden & Gun recognize that many visitors to our website are concerned about the information that they provide to us or that may be collected, and how we treat that information. In order to address those concerns we have developed this website Privacy Statement.
A. TYPES OF INFORMATION COLLECTED
At this website, we may collect both personally identifiable information and non-personal information from you.
1. Personally identifiable information. You don’t have to provide us with your personally identifiable information (such as your name, address, telephone number, email address) in order to read most of what’s posted on this site. We do collect personally identifiable information about you when you set up an account for your subscription with us or place an order from the site. Such information may include name, address, phone number, email address, credit card numbers, expiration dates, CVV codes, as well as billing and shipping addresses. We may also collect personally identifiable information about you when you sign up to receive newsletters or emails regarding your account, enter a contest, respond to a survey, email us, or when we alert you that you must submit personally identifiable information. Without this information, we would not be able to fulfill your orders, or respond to your inquiries, entries, and requests. Please also note that several features of the site, such as advertisements, may be operated by third parties. These third parties may also obtain personally identifiable information from you in order to use their services. Please check their privacy policies for information about their privacy practices. In some cases these third parties may provide your personally identifiable information to Garden & Gun.
2. Non-personal information. Non-personal information, such as which pages on the site are accessed, what information is downloaded, what type of browser and operating system are being used, which Internet service provider is being used, and other information of this general type may be collected about visitors to the site. We collect and store this data on an aggregate and/or anonymous basis. We do not use this information to personally identify the site visitor. By collecting this information we learn how best to develop our website to meet the needs and desires of our visitors.
B. METHODS OF INFORMATION COLLECTION
1. Personally identifiable information is collected when submitted by you—such as when you sign up for an account with us, place an order for a product, or when you send us an email. Your personally identifiable information may be collected by third party service providers and then provided to Garden & Gun by the third party. Non-personal information may be collected via cookies, pixel tags, or other tracking technology.
2. A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on your computer when you visit our website, and that your browser provides to the website each time you return. We use cookies to identify and track visitors, their usage of our website, and their website access preferences. Most browsers are set to automatically allow cookies. If you do not wish to have cookies placed on your computer, you should set your browser to refuse cookies before using our website, with the drawback that certain features of the website may not function properly without the aid of cookies. A pixel tag (also called a web beacon or clear GIF) is a tiny graphic with a unique identifier, embedded invisibly on a webpage (or an online ad or email), and is used to count or track things like activity on a webpage or ad impressions or clicks, as well as to access cookies stored on users’ computers. We use pixel tags to measure the popularity of our various pages, features and services.
C. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION
1. Personally identifiable information. If you sign up for a subscription account with us or place an order from the site, then we may use your personally identifiable information to maintain your account and to correspond with you. We may also use it to send you information that we think would be of interest to you, such as Garden & Gun events, new Garden & Gun books, or similar matters. We may also provide your personally identifiable information to advertisers or others. If you enter one of our contests, then we may use your personally identifiable information for purposes of the contest (such as to notify you if you win) or otherwise in accordance with the contest official rules. We may also provide your personally identifiable information to the sponsor(s) of the contest or publish information concerning the winner of the contest, as permitted by the contest rules. If you email us or ask to be placed on a mailing list that we maintain, then we may contact you and send information to you. If you register to purchase merchandise from us, then we may use your personally identifiable information to maintain your account and/or process your order. If we receive your personally identifiable information from a third party service provider, then we may use the information to contact you and to assist in performing the service for which you have registered with the third party. In addition to the uses listed above, we may use your personally identifiable information to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, as part of a statistical website usage analysis, and/or to improve the features and content of this website. We may also use your personally identifiable information to assist in delivery of content that is customized to your interests. We may also use your personally identifiable information as set forth elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.
2. Non-personal information. We may use your non-personal information to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, as part of a statistical website usage analysis, to improve the features and content of this website, and/or for other purposes to assist our business. We may share such information with advertisers and other third parties, typically in the aggregate. We may also use your non-personal information as set forth elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.
3. Links from the site to advertisers and other third parties. Please be aware that Garden & Gun advertisers, business partners, sponsors, service providers, and other third parties accessible through the site (such as via links from this site and/or framed on this site) may have their own privacy practices. Garden & Gun is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy policies of the third parties when providing information to them.

Financial institutions, such as those which process credit card orders, are subject to federal privacy laws.
4. Other third parties. During the course of its business, Garden & Gun uses third party service providers, such as lawyers and accountants, to perform a variety of functions. In some instances, Garden & Gun may need to provide personal and/or non-personal information about you to such third parties. However, all third party service providers that are not linked from the site are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any purpose other than that for which they were selected to work with Garden & Gun.
