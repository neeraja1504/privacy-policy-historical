This Privacy Policy does not pertain to other information that is collected offline or to information that is posted or provided by third parties. BY USING THIS SITE, YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE REVIEWED AND UNDERSTAND THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND THIS PRIVACY POLICY, THAT YOU ACCEPT AND ARE SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND THAT YOU CONSENT TO OUR PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION FOR THE PURPOSES STATED BELOW. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS SITE.
A. Information Collected
This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected on this Site.
We automatically collect certain information when you use this Site. For example, we may collect identifying information that allows us to track the number of users of this Site and the way users navigate through this Site. The types of identifying information collected may include the date and time you use this Site, the search terms that you use, the content you view, the products you purchase, your IP address and associated location information, as well as the operating software and browser being used to access or use this Site.
We collect two types of information from visitors to this Site: (1) Personally Identifiable Information; and (2) Non- Personally Identifiable Information, such as your IP address or information obtained from cookies.
(1) Personally Identifiable Information.
“ Personally Identifiable Information ” is information provided voluntarily to us by you that identifies you personally, such as your name, address, telephone number, email address, or company name that GOL may collect and store. GOL may use that Personally Identifiable Information to communicate with you by email, telephone or otherwise. Here are some examples of ways in which we may collect your Personally Identifiable Information on this Site:
We may collect your first and last name, mailing address and billing information if you purchase a product or service on this Site.
We may collect registration details about a product you purchase from GOL. This information may be tied to your name and mailing address.
We may collect your first and last name, email address, phone number or product or service details if you contact us with a question related to our products or services.
We may collect your first and last name, mailing information, email address and phone number if you register for GOL’s newsletter.
We may collect your first and last name, mailing information, email address and billing information if you download information from this Site.
We may collect your first and last name, date of birth and email address if you choose to participate in a contest or sweepstakes.
The above list only provides examples of the types of Personally Identifiable Information that may be collected on this Site. If you do not want GOL to collect your Personally Identifiable Information, please do not provide it to us.
(2) Non-Personally Identifiable Information
“ Non-Personally Identifiable Information ” may be technical or demographic information, such as your age, location, gender or interests. Non-Personally Identifiable Information does NOT identify you personally. Here are some examples of the Non-Personally Identifiable Information that is collected via this Site:
Internet Protocol (IP) address — Your IP address is a number that identifies each computer participating in a computer network.
Cookie — A “ cookie ” is a small text file that may be used to collect information about your activity on this Site or to track users across the Internet. For example, when someone visits a page within this Site, a cookie is placed on the user’s machine (if the user accepts cookies) or is read if the user has visited this Site previously. Some of the cookies we use may be flash cookies or Adobe cookies. You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser, but if you do, you may not be able to take advantage of the personalized features enjoyed by other users to our Site.
Web Beacons (also known as “clear gifs,” “web bugs” or “pixel tags”) — “ Web Beacons ” are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. Web Beacons may be used to count users who have visited certain pages of this Site and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns. When used in HTML-formatted email messages, Web Beacons can tell the sender whether and when the email has been opened. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, Web Beacons are embedded invisibly on web pages.
Product Information — We may collect registration information or other details with respect to a product or service you have ordered or requested.
In some of our email messages to you, we may use a “click-through URL.” When you click one of these URLs, you pass through our web server before arriving at the website that is your destination. We track click-throughs to help us determine your interest in particular topics and to measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. We use the information we collect to provide you with more relevant advertisements. This statistical information is also used to monitor the usage of this Site and for advertising purposes. This information does not include Personally Identifiable Information.
We may collect the above Non-Personally Identifiable Information from all visitors to our Site. If you do not want GOL to have access to this information, please do not visit our Site.
