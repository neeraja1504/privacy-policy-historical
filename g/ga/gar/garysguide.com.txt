|  |  Your privacy is very important to us. We do not sell, rent or exchange your personal information to third parties for their marketing or any other purposes without your explicit consent. Please read this privacy policy to learn more about the ways in which we use and protect your personal information. If you have any additional questions or comments you may send us an email us at info@garysguide.com 1. Overview
This privacy policy applies to all our services available under the domain and subdomains of Garysguide.com (the “Site”). By visiting this website you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this privacy policy. If you do not agree please do not use or access our Site. 2. About Us
Garysguide.com is an online social-networking club, guide and city portal for the local community. It aims to connect people within the local communites of New York City, Long Island, Westchester, New Jersey and Connecticut. Through our site, our members build their personal networks that allows them to meet other members, find jobs, roommates, buy and sell items, post personal ads, create events, create clubs, network for business and interact with their local community, among other things. Members can create their own personal profiles, and those profiles are then shown to their Network of friends. A user's personal Network includes the extended group of people that a user is connected to through their friends (up to four degrees of separation). 3. Information We Collect
Garysguide collects information our users submit to us such as their name and e-mail address to allow us to identify users and notify them of changes or updates to our service. We also collect personal information submitted by our users in filling out their profile on the service such as gender, state of residence, occupation, interests, etc. We collect this personal information when our users: (a) sign up as a member; (b) make changes to their member profile information; and (c) send e-mail messages, forms, or other information to us via Garysguide.com. Members may choose to provide additional information beyond their basic profile for their personal and professional profiles. Providing additional information beyond what is required at registration is entirely optional, but enables our users to better identify each other and more effectively connect and interact with their network. Garysguide.com also collects information from users that is unique, but cannot be linked to a specific individual, such as browser type. We gather this information on all visitors to Garysguide.com for systems administration purposes and to track user trends, such as our most popular features. 4. Our Use Of Your Information
Garysguide uses personal information to create a secure and personalized service for our members. The Basic, Personal and Professional Profile information is displayed to all members and visitors of Garysguide.com. All other profile information members provide (eg. email address, date of birth) is not displayed to anyone. The member's full name is displayed only when a user invites a friend via email to join the service, when a user requests to add another user to their friend list, and when we send notifications to a user related to their use of the service. Except when members invite friends, full names are not shared or displayed with people outside of their own Personal Network. Users within a Personal Network communicate on Garysguide.com with each other through the Garysguide.com service without disclosing their email addresses. 5. Our Disclosure Of Your Information

Garysguide.com stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this invitation and reminders, and for tracking the success of our Invite functionality.9. External Websites
