3. INFORMATION THAT DOES NOT IDENTIFY YOU
gShift Labs collects certain technical information from your computer’s Web browser or Internet device when you visit www.gshiftlabs.com on the Internet. This information includes the amount of time spent on the site by a visitor with a unique Internet identifier, the pages visited and returned to, the operating system, and Web browser used, the referring Website and any keywords used to find our site on a search Website. These server logs do not contain any personal information and can only be accessed by gShift Labs. Server log files are used solely to track visits to our Website and improve the experience, content and layout of our site. gShift Labs makes no attempt to link this traffic information to the individuals visiting our Website.
gShift Labs has also implemented Remarketing with Google Analytics for Display Advertising online. gShift Labs and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on someone’s past visits to www.gshiftlabs.com. As a result, gShift’s ads are shown on websites across the Internet. Visitors can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads using the Ads Preferences Manager.
Anyone can browse gShift Labs’ Website with cookies turned off, but if you’re a gShift Labs agency partner or client and you wish to log in to your gShift Labs account, you must accept cookies. A cookie/session variable is assigned to you when you log in, and placed on your computer for programming purposes only. This is a session cookie that uniquely identifies you as you move from page to page inside the Extranet area. It ensures that you have properly logged in and that your organization’s personal information is only accessible to you. The cookie is destroyed as soon as you close your browser and is never redirected to any other servers.
4. DISCLOSURE AND RETENTION OF YOUR INFORMATION
We do not sell, trade or share any of your personal information with any other third-party organizations. We will release personal information when we believe such release is appropriate in order to comply with the law; for example, if we receive a subpoena or court order.
If you have subscribed to gShift Labs’ blog, your email address and other information that you have provided to us is kept as long as you are a subscriber.
In the event that you choose to unsubscribe from gShift Labs’ blog and news alerts, your information will be immediately deleted from our database, and you will no longer receive any information from gShift Labs. However, residual information about you may remain in backup files temporarily. Backups of our blog subscriber databases occur nightly and weekly. Weekly backups are overwritten such that information older than one week is permanently destroyed and irretrievable.
5. ACCURACY OF THE INFORMATION AND ACCESS TO IT
gShift Labs relies exclusively on the information provided by its Website users and subscribers, and will not seek independent verification of any of the information supplied. Thus, a blog subscriber, or someone awaiting a response to a request for information is responsible for letting gShift Labs know if their email address has changed. Personal information can be viewed and corrected directly by gShift clients or agency partners once they have logged in.
6. HOW IS THE INFORMATION KEPT SAFE?
The server is protected by an enterprise firewall that is immediately updated when new patches and fixes are released.
Information entered anywhere else on our Website is transmitted to the gShift Labs server unencrypted, using standard Internet protocol (HTTP). You should be aware of the inherent risks of interception when communicating with others online. Visit gShift Labs’ Terms and Conditions for further details. Your email messages to gShift Labs are kept secure once they reach us – software is installed on all computers at gShift Labs’ location that prevents viruses and malicious activity.
By providing you with this Privacy Policy, gShift Labs is pledging its continued commitment to protecting the information we collect. We regularly review our information-handling practices to ensure that we are abiding by this policy.
