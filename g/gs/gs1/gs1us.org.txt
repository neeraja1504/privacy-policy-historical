1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT ON OUR SITES
Information You Provide To Us
The Sites may ask you to provide information that could reasonably be used to contact you or to identify you personally (such as first and last name, e-mail address, telephone number or credit card information) (“ Personal Information ”). Personal Information does not include corporate information, which relates to an organization but not to an individual (such as a corporate name, corporate address or general corporate phone number). In addition to Personal Information and corporate information, we may also ask you to provide other information about yourself, such as demographic information (zip code, preferences, etc.) or certain information about your preferences and interests. If we combine demographic or other information we collect about you with your Personal Information we collect, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information consistent with this Privacy Policy.
Note that the Sites are directed to a general audience. Accordingly, we do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children younger than the age of thirteen (13) and we will delete any Personal Information collected that we later determine to be from a user younger than the age of thirteen (13). In the event that we become aware that we have collected personal information from any child, we will dispose of that information in accordance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“ COPPA ”) and other applicable laws and regulations. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe that your child under the age of thirteen (13) has provided us with personal information without COPPA-required consent, please contact us at legal@gs1us.org.
Please note that information submitted to the Sites via a “contact us” or other similar function may not receive a response. We will not use the information you provide us via the “contact us” tool to contact you for unrelated marketing purposes unless we disclose otherwise.
Information We Collect Automatically As You Access and Use the Sites
In addition to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to submit to us, whenever you visit or interact with the Sites or GS1 US content, GS1 US, as well as any third-party advertisers and/or service providers, may use a variety of technologies that automatically (or passively) collect information about how the Sites and content are accessed and used (“Usage Information”).
This Usage Information may include:
Usage Information does not generally identify an individual, but if GS1 US uses Usage Information to be able to identify a specific individual person, GS1 US treats it as Personal Information. Some mobile service providers may also provide us or our third-party service providers with information regarding the physical location of the Device used to access the Sites. A few of the methods and technologies that may be used on the Sites to collect Usage Information include, without limitation, the following (and subsequent technology and methods hereafter developed):
There may be other tracking technologies now and later devised and used by us in connection with the Sites. Further, third parties may use tracking technologies in connection with our Sites, which may include the collection of information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services and Devices. We may not control those tracking technologies and we are not responsible for them.
Interactions with Third-Party Services
The Sites may include functionality that allows certain kinds of interactions between the Sites and a third-party web site or application. The use of this functionality may involve the third-party operator providing certain information, including Personal Information, to us. For example, if you click on social media icons on the Sites (such as for Facebook, Twitter or Instagram), those actions may be associated with, and we may have access to, your Personal Information you provided on those third-party sites or applications. If so, we will then treat it as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy, since we are collecting it as a result of your accessing of and interaction on our Sites. In addition, we may provide third-party sites’ interfaces or links on the Sites to facilitate your sending a communication from the Sites. For example, we may use third parties to facilitate emails, tweets or Facebook postings. These third parties may retain any information used or provided in any such communications or other activities and these third parties’ practices are not subject to our Privacy Policy. GS1 US may not control or have access to your communications through these third parties. Further, when you use third-party sites or services, you are using their services and not our services and they, not we, are responsible for their practices. You should review the applicable third-party privacy policies before using such third-party tools on our Sites.
California /Delaware Do Not Track Disclosures
Various third parties are developing or have developed signals or other mechanisms for the expression of consumer choice regarding the collection of information about an individual consumer’s online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services ( e.g., browser do not track signals). Currently, we do not monitor or take any action with respect to these signals or other mechanisms.
2. HOW WE USE INFORMATION COLLECTED THROUGH OUR SITES
GS1 US may use information collected through our Sites, including Personal Information, in order to: (1) allow you to participate in features we offer; (2) process a transaction you initiate such as to send you newsletters or provide you with promotional materials on our behalf, including to let you know about new products, services and upcoming events; (3) process your registration or maintain your account, including, at times, verifying that the information you provide is active and valid; (4) provide you with information, products or services that you have requested or agreed to receive and provide our affiliates and member organizations with information relating thereto; (5) tailor content, advertisements, marketing materials and offers we display or send/serve to you; (6) improve the Sites, our products and our services; (7) facilitate your job search via the Sites and prepare related governmental and internal statistics reports; (8) contact you with regard to your use of the Sites, your account, and, in our discretion, changes to the Sites and/or any GS1 US policy; (9) provide member support; (10) for purposes disclosed at the time you provide your Personal Information or otherwise with your consent; (11) for internal business purposes; and (12) for purposes disclosed at the time you provide your information or as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy.

Please be aware that when you use any send-to-a-friend functionality on our Sites, your e-mail address may be included in the communication sent to your friend.

If you choose to enter or otherwise participate in a Promotion, your Personal Information may be disclosed to third parties in connection with the administration of such Promotion, such as in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment, and as required by law, such as on a winners list. By entering a Promotion, you are agreeing to the official rules that govern that Promotion, which may contain specific requirements of you, including, except where prohibited by law, allowing the sponsor and/or other parties to use your name, voice and/or likeness in advertising or marketing materials.

We may share your information and data, including, without limitation, Personal Information and corporate information with other entities affiliated with us for internal reasons, primarily for business and operational purposes. GS1 US or any of its assets, including the Sites, may be sold, or other transactions may occur in which your Personal Information is one of the business assets for the transaction. In such a case, your Personal Information may be one of the business assets we transfer to a subsequent owner, co-owner or operator of the Sites or applicable database. Hence, GS1 US reserves the right to disclose and transfer user information, including Personal Information in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, restructuring, the sale of certain of GS1 US’s stock and/or assets, or other corporate change, including, without limitation, during the course of any due diligence process.

5. INFORMATION WE RECEIVE FROM THIRD PARTIES
GS1 US may receive information about you from third parties. For example, if you are on another web site and you opt-in to receive information from GS1 US, that web site will forward to us your e-mail address and other information about you so that we may contact you as requested. You may also choose to participate in a third party application or feature (such as a Facebook application or a similar application or feature on a third party web site) through which you allow us to collect (or the third party to share) information about you, including Personal Information. The third party may allow you to remove the application or feature, in which case we will no longer collect information about you through the application or feature, but we may retain the information previously collected; provided, however, if you are located or a resident of the EU, please see Section 12 below on our retention of your information. In addition, we may receive information about you if other users of a third party web site give us access to their profiles and you are one of their “connections” or information about you is otherwise accessible through your “connections” web page, profile page, or similar page on a social networking or other third party web site or interactive service. And, if you choose to “like” content on our Sites or to otherwise post information from or via our Sites to a third party web site, feature or application, that information will become public and the third party web site may have access to information about you and your use of our Sites.
We may also supplement the information we collect about you through the Sites with outside records from third parties in order to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you. We may combine the information we receive from these third parties with information we collect through the Sites. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to any Personal Information received, unless we have disclosed otherwise.
6. AD SERVING AND TRAFFIC MEASUREMENT SERVICES WE MAY USE; HOW TO “OPT OUT” OF RECEIVING ADVERTISING RELEVANT TO YOU
GS1 US may use third party network advertisers, ad exchanges and similar vendors to serve our advertisements across the Internet and we may use third party analytics service providers to evaluate and provide us and/or third parties with information about the use of these ads on third party sites and viewing of our ads and our content. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements, which may be based on your visits to the Sites and other locations across the Internet and mobile media you have visited (“ Behavioral Ads ”). Behavioral Ads enable us to target advertisements to you for products and services in which we believe you might be interested. If you object to receiving Behavioral Ads from us on third party sites, you can learn more about your ability to limit Behavioral Ads below. Our third party ad network and exchange providers, the advertisers, the sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may themselves set and access their own cookies, web beacons and other tracking technologies on your Device and track certain behavioral Usage Information regarding users of your Device via a unique identifier. Note that any images (or any other parts of a web page) served by third parties in association with third party cookies may serve as web beacons, which enable third parties to carry out the previously described activities. Third party cookies and web beacons are governed by each third party’s specific privacy policy, not this one. With regard to advertisements, we and our network advertisers may target advertisements for products and services in which you might be interested based on your visits to both the Sites and other web sites. These third party technologies may be set to, among other things: (a) help deliver advertisements to you that you might be interested in; (b) prevent you from seeing the same advertisements; and (c) understand the usefulness of the advertisements that have been delivered to you. You acknowledge and agree that associated technology may access and use your Device and may set or change settings on your Device in connection with the associated operations. Note that any images (or any other parts of content) served by third parties in association with third-party ads or other content may serve as web beacons, which enable third parties to carry out the previously described activities. We may share Usage Information about visitors to the Sites with third party advertising companies for the same purposes. By using the Sites, you further agree that GS1 US may change, alter, or modify the settings or configurations on your Internet Device in order to allow for or optimize your use of the Sites. We may use a variety of companies to serve advertisements.
Statements regarding our practices do not apply to the methods for collecting information used by these third parties or the use of the information that such third parties collect. The relevant third party’s terms of service, privacy policy, permissions, notices and choices should be reviewed regarding their collection, storage and sharing practices. We make no representations regarding the policies or practices of third party advertisers or advertising networks or exchanges or related third parties.
We and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as a DoubleClick cookie) together to report how your ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to our Sites. Google’s use of the DoubleClick cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads based on your visit to our Sites and/or other sites and online services. To learn more about how to opt out of Google’s use of first-party cookies, click here. To learn more about how to opt out of DoubleClick’s use of cookies, visit the DoubleClick opt-out page, here.
Further, while sites use a variety of companies to serve advertisements, you may also wish to visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp, which provides information regarding this practice by Network Advertising Initiative (“ NAI ”) members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including the “opt-out” procedures of NAI members. Opting out of one or more NAI members only means that those NAI members no longer will be allowed under their own rules to deliver Behavioral Ads to you, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads. Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different Device or change web browsers, your NAI opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective. You may also opt-out of receiving Behavioral Ads on participating sites and services by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance (“ DAA ”) website at http://www.aboutads.info/choices/#completed. Similar limitations may apply to the DAA opt-out. We are not responsible for effectiveness of or compliance with any third parties’ opt-out options or programs.

Also, if you have made any public postings on a social networking feature, such as in a Community Forum or other community sections of the Sites, these communications may not generally be removed.
8. SECURITY
We incorporate commercially reasonable safeguards to help protect and secure your Personal Information. However, no electronic data transmission or storage of information can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Please note that we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you use the Sites and provide us with your information at your own risk.
9. THIRD PARTY CONTENT, LINKS TO OTHER WEB SITES AND OTHER WEB SITES THAT DISPLAY OR CONTAIN GS1 US CONTENT
When you are on the Sites you may see certain content, which may be delivered by a non-affiliated third party, and you may be directed to other content, web sites or other online services that are operated and controlled by third parties that are beyond our control. This includes links from advertisers, sponsors and partners that may use our logo(s) as part of a co-branding agreement and other links off or our Site. In addition, GS1 US widgets or other GS1 US content may be included on web pages and web sites that are not associated with GS1 US and over which we have no control. These third parties may send their own cookies and similar tracking technologies to your Device, they may independently collect data or solicit Personal Information and may or may not have their own published privacy policies. GS1 US is not responsible for the data collection and privacy practices employed by any third party or their sites or apps and they may be tracking you across multiple online services and may be sharing the results of that tracking with us and/or others. These third parties may have their own terms of service, privacy policies or other policies and ask you to agree to the same. Be sure to review any available policies before submitting any personally identifiable information to a third-party online service or otherwise interacting with it and exercise caution in connection with these services.
