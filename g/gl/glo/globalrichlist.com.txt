These organisations will have their own privacy policies so please do make sure you read them before providing your information.
We may also collect personal information about you from the public domain, such as from social networks, company websites, political and property registers and news archives. We may also work with experts from external agencies to collect this information. This helps us find out where our supporters come from, what they do and what they are most interested in. This helps us to talk to you about the things that are most relevant to you and helps us find more passionate people like you to support CARE International’s vital work.
The types of personal information we might hold about you
Your name, address, email address and phone numbers
Your date of birth
Your bank or credit card details (only if you are making a donation)
Your previous donation history and details of your plans to give in the future

Additional research about you

Your parliamentary constituency
An estimate of your age, the size and make up of your household and your interests
Possible geodemographic segmentation (this is characterising neighbourhoods on the principle that residents living near each other are likely to have similar demographic, socio-economic and lifestyle characteristics)
If you are making a significant donation we may carry out desk research into the source of your donation. You can read more about this in our donation acceptance policy. Please contact supportercare@careinternational.org or call our Supporter Care team on 020 7091 6100 to receive a copy of this policy.
