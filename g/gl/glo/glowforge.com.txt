Privacy Policy - Glowforge - the 3D laser printer
Last Updated: June 7, 2017
Welcome to the Glowforge, Inc., Privacy Policy. We are a Delaware corporation, located in Seattle, Washington. For purposes of this policy, when we say stuff like “We” and “Us,” we mean Glowforge, Inc., the Company. When we say stuff like “Website” or “Site,” we’re talking about our website at http://glowforge.com and community.glowforge.com, along with other websites, networks, applications, and software provided in connection with Glowforge hardware products, and other services (collectively, the “Service”) that we may provide.
This Privacy Policy, which is incorporated into and is subject to the Glowforge Terms of Service, applies to any information that is collected while you are on our website. Our goal with this policy is to be transparent about what information we collect, how and when we use it, and when and whether it is shared.
By visiting and (we hope!) using our site to make beautiful things, you acknowledge and consent to this Privacy Policy. If you have questions or complaints about this policy, we encourage you to send them to privacy@glowforge.com.
Like many privacy policies past, present, and doubtless future, our Privacy Policy explains:
The types of information we collect
How we use that information
The choices we offer, including how to access or update your own information, and
The steps we take to keep your information safe
Of course, our Privacy Policy may change. Please revisit this page periodically to stay aware of any changes. If we make material changes to this policy, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you of the change. Your continued use of the website or Service after the revised Privacy Policy has become effective indicates that you have read, understood and agreed to the current version of this Privacy Policy.
WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?
We Collect Information When You Browse the Site
When you visit the Site we may collect data, much of which is anonymous. This data includes information such as: the type of browser and OS you use; the time and date that you visit; your IP address and the general geographical location the IP identifies you as being at; the address of the external or internal page that referred you; search terms you might have used to find our site, or if you used an email to access our site, what email you clicked on; and the pages on the site that you visit, possibly including the order of the pages you visit and any actions you take on a given page. We mostly use this information to figure out how people are using our site and what interests them, and we may also use it to diagnose issues with the site.
We Collect Information When You Sign Up
There are lots of reasons you might give us information:
So you can follow us, or so we can put you on a mailing list
So you can order something
So you can report a problem with something
So you can take advantage of our referral program
So you can enter a contest
So you can apply to a job
So you can create an account, for example for the forums,
So you can communicate with us via social media, for example our Facebook or Twitter or Instagram account, or
To tell us your marketing preferences
Once you are on our mailing list, you will remain on the list until you unsubscribe, which you can do at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link in every email. Or if you prefer, you can send an email to privacy@glowforge.com and we will remove it for you. We use SendGrid to provide email list services, and their privacy policy is here.
In any of the situations we list, we take the information you give us and hold onto it for our records. In so doing, we may store information such as: your name; your email address; your username and password; the name of any referrer; the name of any people referred; your contact information, including any billing or shipping address/es; records of anything you order from us or request from us; and photos or other documents submitted by you or collected through the Service, including photos taken by the Glowforge, to enable your use of that User Content or to resolve any issues that may arise with the Service.
If you submit a document or photo to any portion of the Service accessible to the public, for example community.glowforge.com, you thereby grant us permission to use that photo in print or online/electronically for any lawful purposes, including as a part of our marketing activities.
While you may submit credit card information while making a purchase with us, we don’t hold onto your full credit card number ourselves – we use a third party payment processor such as Stripe or Paypal, and they keep that credit card information in their credit card vaults. We keep a record of the last 4 digits of the card you used because that helps us to identify given transactions later. With regards your full credit card number, we use third parties to process and store this information. Stripe’s privacy policy is here, and Paypal’s privacy policy is here.
We Collect Information When You Interact with Us on Social Media, or Use Social Media Buttons on our Site
You may see Facebook “like” buttons or “share” buttons on our website, or similar buttons on our website or other social media sites. If you use those buttons, we may collect your IP address and where you were on our site or on social media when you used the button. These kinds of social media features are governed by the privacy policies of the companies providing them. Here are the policies of a few of those companies:
Facebook
Twitter
Instagram
YouTube
LinkedIn Note that if you share information with us on a public social media site, that information may be seen by the general public and any other person or entity might collect and keep that information for their own purposes.
We Collect Information on Use of the Service through Cookies and Pixel Tags.
Some of our data partners, such as Google Analytics and Full Story, use cookies to help us better understand our website visitors.

What’s a pixel tag?
Pixel tags (also called clear GIFs, web beacons, conversion pixels, or tracking pixels) are small blocks of code on a webpage or app that allow them to do things like read and place cookies and transmit information to us or our partners. The resulting connection can include information such as a device’s IP address, the time a person viewed the pixel, whether a viewer did a particular activity, an identifier associated with the browser or device and the type of browser being used.
We use pixel tags from a number of companies including Facebook, and the information collected is to help us target our ads more effectively. The Facebook Cookie and Pixel Policy is here. The Fullstory privacy policy is here.
We Collect Information When You Communicate With Us Directly
If you email us or send us other communications directly, we will retain your email or address and correspondence so that we may respond to your request. We may retain this information indefinitely so that we have a history of our past communications. One way that you might communicate with us is by applying for a job via our jobs website, which collects information and shares it with us via our partner Lever.co. The Lever.co privacy policy is here. We may share this information with trusted partners, for example while doing a reference check before you join our company.
WHO DO WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION WITH?
We may share our mailing list with trusted partners who sell products or services complementary to our own. To opt out, please send an email to privacy@glowforge.com.
We share information with our vendors, as described in this policy, for the purposes of providing services to you. These vendors are not authorized to use or disclose the information, other than to perform their services for us. For example, as we described above, we share information with Sendgrid so that they can operate our mailing list, but they are not authorized to email you directly or share your information with others. The same applies to vendors who operate services for us such as: our forums, our referral program, our job application page, shipping, market research, and payment processing.

If we are about to release your information, we will try to provide you with notice in advance, unless we are legally prohibited from doing so;
If we believe we have to in order (i) take precautions against liability; (ii) protect ourselves or others from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses or activity; (iii) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; (iv) protect the security or integrity of the Service and any facilities or equipment used to make the Service available; or (v) protect our property or other legal rights (including, but not limited to, enforcement of our agreements), or the rights, property, or safety of others; and
To transfer to an acquirer, successor, or assignee as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of assets, or similar transaction, or in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which information is transferred to one or more third parties as one of our business assets. This Privacy Policy would continue to apply to any data collected while it was in place.
