Generally, Webinterpret does not disclose the Personal Data collected or that you provide to
Webinterpret to third parties unless Webinterpret has obtained your prior consent.
However, Webinterpret may disclose the Personal Data about you to such recipients as affiliates,
vendors, agents and contractors that assist Webinterpret in administering the Site and in providing
services to you, with the online marketplaces on which you advertise and sell your products, and
in response to legal process or when Webinterpret believes that the law requires it (for example,
in response to a court order) or to protect the rights, property or safety of Webinterpret, the Site,
users of the Site and others.
Webinterpret may also disclose Personal Data as is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal
action against a person or entity who may be violating Webinterpret’s Terms of Service, or who
may be causing harm to, or interfering with, other users of the Site.
Webinterpret may also disclose Personal Data about you to third parties who provide other
services; such recipients provide credit payment, reporting, order fulfillment services, and other
services on Webinterpret’s behalf. Also, in the event that assets of Webinterpret are transferred
or sold to another entity, Personal Data may be transferred to the acquiring entity and/or to
potential acquiring entities.
Transfers of Personal Data outside of the European Economic Area
The Personal Data that Webinterpret collects from you and that you provide to Webinterpret is
processed in Ireland and is stored on servers in Ireland and the US.
Your Personal Data may also be transferred to any third parties as described in the previous
section, but such transfers will only be made based on the adequacy decision issued by the
European Commission pursuant to article 45 of GDPR (should the service providers or their
technical providers be located outside the EEA area). Some of these third parties to whom your
Personal Data will be shared are located outside of the European Economic Area, in countries
where data protection laws may not be as extensive as those which apply to us. For the sellers
with their seats in the People’s Republic of China, their Personal Data may be transferred to our
Chinese entity (Webinterpret China).
The entities mentioned above that, together with us provide the services to you are joint personal
data controllers (together with us). Our agreement with those entities establishes mutual
obligations of all the parties to protect your rights, and it stipulates as follows:
•   Each party is a joint data controller, and each party is responsible for the protection of your
personal data in the context of rendering its services;
•   Neither party has a right to represent the other party in the context of personal data;
•   Each party is obliged to provide you with the information requested under Article 13 of the
GDPR;
•   You have the right to submit to any of the parties a request to provide information on
personal data processing, rectify your data, restrict processing or erasure of your data, as
4well as the right to data portability and right to withdraw your consent provided to process
your data by either of the party; a party that receives such request is obliged to pass the
information to other join controllers.
If we transfer your Personal Data to countries outside of the European Economic Area, we will
ensure that we do this following the EU data protection regulations (in particular the GDPR) and
with due respect for the rights and freedoms of individuals whose Personal data are processed.
We will do this to ensure the level of protection which applies to your Personal Data processed in
these countries is similar to that which applies within the European Economic Area.

means of communication. Personal Data communicated through the Internet may be intercepted
5
by other people. We cannot guarantee the security of Personal Data sent to us through this Site.
