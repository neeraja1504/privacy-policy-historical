Privacy Policy | GlobalTranz
GlobalTranz is the leading provider of web-based freight transportation management services for small businesses. Our tools allow shipping customers to compare a wide range of carriers, choose the best rate and service for their needs, and manage all their shipments with one simple solution.
GlobalTranz has created this statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for the GlobalTranz web site.
GlobalTranz collects various information for various purposes. The information collected is used to market and improve the services we offer, to improve our web site content, and to contact customers or vendors with service updates, technical updates, or for other marketing purposes. If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should contact GlobalTranz by email at shannon@globaltranz.com or by phone at 866-275-1407 x104.
IP Address and Cookies
We use your IP address to help diagnose technical problems and to administer our web site. Our site also uses cookies to help us recognize returning customers and better administrate the repeat functionality of our web site.
Information Collection During the registration process, GlobalTranz requires users to give us contact information via a customer registration form. We then use a customer’s email address to send out customer access information. The customer’s contact information is also used for account purposes such as address verification and confirmation of shipments tendered with GlobalTranz. We also contact customers for the purposes of notifying them of service updates and explanation of services. Users may opt-out of receiving service updates, as explained in the “choice/opt-out” section below.
During the shipment administration process, GlobalTranz requests shipment information from the user in order to process their shipment. This information includes shipping and receiving addresses, product descriptions and the date and time of the shipment. GlobalTranz utilizes this information to generate an electronic pickup with a freight carrier and to forward the necessary shipping documents to the shipping or receiving parties. All of this information is required in order to correctly process a shipment request.
GlobalTranz allows the user to create an address book to simplify and speed up the shipment process. GlobalTranz may contact a stored address of a user if a shipment tendered by a user cannot be delivered.
Information Sharing and Access
Contracted agents enroll new users by submitting account information to GlobalTranz such as: company name, address and email address. GlobalTranz uses this information to create new accounts. A contracted agent can access only the account and shipment information for those users they have enrolled. Contracted agents have no direct access to any GlobalTranz databases.
A sponsoring trade association has access only to the names and addresses of their own members. Associations have no direct access to any GlobalTranz databases.
Shipping and receiving information for each shipment is submitted electronically to the freight carrier chosen by the shipper. GlobalTranz does not share a user’s personal information with any other third parties for any purposes beyond that required for shipment administration. Carriers have no direct access to any GlobalTranz databases.
