1. Information we collect from you
Our site collects both general and personal information. General information may include:
your domain name and host for Internet access; the date and time of your entry; your IP
address, browser type, or operating system; the pages you visit and links that you use; if
you linked to our site from a third party site, the domain name from which you linked to our
site; your zip code; and, other general demographic information. Personal information may
be collected from you in connection with a registration form, an online survey, a
sweepstakes or contest, or other instances when you submit information through our site.
You can choose not to provide information to us, but some information about you may be
required in order for you to register for our annual summit or to enjoy certain benefits of
our site.
We also may periodically obtain both personal and non-personal information about you from
affiliated entities, business partners and other independent third-party sources and add it to
other information about you. For example, if you visit www.globalwellnesssummit.com from
a site operated by one of our business partners, and you have registered with that partner,
then information about you that you have provided to that partner may be shared with us.
Cookies and Other Web Technologies.
Cookies are small data text files and can be stored on your computer’s hard drive (if your
Web browser permits). Our site uses cookies for the following general purposes:
GLOBAL WELLNESS SUMMIT PRIVACY POLICY
   To help us recognize your browser as a previous visitor and save and remember any
preferences that may have been set while your browser was visiting our site. For
example, if you register on our site, we may use cookies to remember your
registration information, so you do not need to log into our site each time you visit.
Please note that member IDs, passwords, and any other account-related data
included in such cookies are encrypted for security purposes.
   To help us customize the content provided to you on our websites and on other
websites across the Internet.
   To help measure and research the effectiveness of website features, offerings, and e-
mail communications (by determining which e-mails you open and act upon).
The “help” portion of the toolbar on most browsers should tell you how to prevent your
browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive
a new cookie, or how to disable most types of cookies. Please note that if you refuse to
accept cookies, you may not be able to access many of the tools offered on our sites.
Our website may also use web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or web bugs),
which are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, that are
placed in the code of a webpage. We use web beacons to monitor the traffic patterns of
users from one page within our sites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to
understand whether you have come to our site from an online advertisement displayed on a
third-party website, and to improve site performance. We may also allow our service
providers to use web beacons to help us understand which emails have been opened by
recipients and to track the visitor traffic and other actions on our site.

potentially prohibited or illegal activities; to enforce our Terms of Use; and as otherwise
described to you at the point of collection.

your interests. Third-party vendors have access to and may collect information only
as needed to perform their functions and are not permitted to share or use the
information for any other purpose.

these third party social media websites.
We also may share your information:

exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by

so for permitted business functions. In addition, we use encryption when transmitting your
