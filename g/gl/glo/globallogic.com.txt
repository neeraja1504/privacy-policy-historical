What are the legal grounds for our processing of your personal data?

Where it is necessary to obtain your prior consent to the processing concerned in order for us to be allowed to do it (for example, direct marketing activities), we will obtain and rely on your consent in relation to the processing concerned (see below for how to withdraw your consent to processing).
Otherwise, we will process your personal data only where the processing is necessary:
for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into such a contract;
for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are a subject; or
for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or another person, provided that this will only be in circumstances in which those legitimate interests are not overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms which require protection of personal data (most circumstances in which we process your personal data in relation to a relationship that we have with the person that you work for will fall into this category).
How long do we process personal data for?
We process personal data only for so long as is necessary for the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected, after which it will be deleted or archived except to the extent that it is necessary for us to continue to process it for the purpose of compliance with legal obligations to which we are subject or for another legitimate and lawful purpose. If you are a customer or prospect, we will maintain personal data for up to 3 years after collection unless another term applies according to such purposes.
Where do we process personal data?
The data that we process in relation to you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”) that may not be subject to equivalent data protection law. It may also be processed by staff situated outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. This includes staff engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of orders, the processing of payment details and the provision of support services.
Where personal data is transferred in relation to providing our services we will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that it is subject to appropriate safeguards and that it is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.
We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.

Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our website or systems, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of your data transmitted to our website and any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.
