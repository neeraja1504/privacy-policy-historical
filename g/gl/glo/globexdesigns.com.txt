Google Redesigned
The Google Redesigned Firefox extension changes the look and feel of popular Googleâ„¢ services.
The extension has no access to any data on any of your Google accounts. The only information the extension will check for is your current extension version and the versions of the extension styles (eg. Gmail Redesigned, Gcal Redesigned, etc) in order to ensure your styles are up-to-date. Google Redesigned is certified by Mozilla Add-ons editors who verify all Firefox extensions for security and stability.
