International or Cross-Border Transfer of Your Personal Data and Your Express Agreement
Given that the Internet operates in a global environment and that transfer of your data is necessary to process your registration, to respond to your email requests and comments, and to send you promotional emails, using the Internet to collect and process Personal Data necessarily involves the transmission of data on an international, or cross-border, basis.  By registering or subscribing to our content and/or communicating with us by email, you acknowledge and expressly consent to our processing and disclosure of your Personal Data in this way.
The Personal Data of users who are located outside the U.S. will be transferred outside of each eligible country to the United States where our servers are located and where it will be processed and stored on servers owned by our hosting company. The U.S. does not provide an adequate level of protection according to EU data protection regulations. We will take steps reasonably necessary to ensure that users’ Personal Data is treated securely, but will not otherwise take steps to ensure compliance with applicable laws in each user’s country of residence. By registering or subscribing to the Site or by sending us emails, you expressly agree to such transfer and disclosure.
Third Party Sites and Links
Our Site may contain links to or features of other websites that are independent, are not owned or operated by us and which may incorporate Third Party Information. This includes third party social media websites and their features such as Facebook, Twitter or Flickr. The collection of information by third party websites is not covered by this Privacy Policy and such third party websites may have their own have separate and independent privacy policies.  If you access other sites or features using the links provided, the operators of these sites may collect information from you, which will be used by them in accordance with their privacy policy, which may differ from ours.  We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of other websites, even if they are linked to our Site.
Do we Use Cookies?
When you visit the Site, we use session “cookies” — a piece of information stored on your computer — to allow us to uniquely identify your browser while you are logged in and to enable us to process your online transactions. Session cookies also help us confirm your identity and are required in order to login into your account. globalvillagespace.com uses persistent cookies that only we can read and use, to identify you as a GVS customer and make it easier for you to log into your account. Users who disable their web browsers’ ability to accept cookies will be able to browse our Site, but they may not be able to access all or parts of our Site. For further information about disabling or blocking cookies, please see ‘Can I withdraw my consent?’ in our Cookie Policy.   The use of cookies by our partners is not covered by our Privacy Policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies. Our partners use session ID cookies to trace user movement on the site.
Advertisement Choices
Online advertising for globalvillagespace.com is delivered by the vendor DoubleClick. DoubleClick places cookies on your browser to facilitate serving particular ads – for instance, to help determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before, to tailor ads to you if you have visited our Site before, and to avoid sending you duplicate advertisements. You can opt out of DoubleClick’s use of cookies for these purposes by visiting http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy/.
In some cases, we and advertisers on foreignpolicy.com and other sites work with other third-party vendors to help deliver advertisements tailored to your interests. These vendors include ad networks and audience segment providers, and they place cookies on your browser to collect information about your online activity (e.g., the sites and pages you have visited) in order to help advertisers deliver particular ads on our Site and other sites that they believe you would find most relevant. You can opt out of those vendors’ use of cookies to tailor advertising to you by visiting http://www.aboutads.info/.
Often our advertisers contract with a third-party service to host their ads. In this case, an ad-serving vendor contacts the advertisers’ hosting service for a particular advertisement. In that case, an independent cookie may be used by the third-party service. We do not have a mechanism to allow visitors to opt-out of cookies from vendors with whom we do not have a contractual relationship.
Clear Gifs
We employ or our third party advertising partner employs a software technology called clear gifs (also known as “Web Beacons” or “Web Bugs”), that help us better manage content on our Site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Website users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.
Website Log Files
As is true of most Websites, we and our third party utility-tracking partners gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp and click stream data.
We use this information to analyze trends, to administer the Site, to track users’ movements around the Site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
Do We Disclose Personal Data to Third Parties?
Occasionally, GVS makes portions of its online and magazine subscription mailing list available to reputable companies and organizations whose products or services we feel may be of interest to you. Many of our subscribers find this a valuable and timesaving service. If you would rather not receive these mailings, you may opt-out by sending an opt-out request to contact@globalvillagespace.com and asking us not to release your name to third parties. Please allow 12 weeks for your request to take effect.
We do not otherwise sell, share or disclose your Personal Data to third parties other than those parties necessary to fulfill your registration. These include trusted third parties that provide services on our behalf, including Site development, maintenance and support, fulfillment, payment processing, and email distribution.
We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our Site policies, or protect our or other’s rights, property, or safety. Because our hosts servers, which store your information, are located in the U.S.A., your information may be available to U.S. government entities or agencies under a lawful court order in the U.S.
By accessing our Site, sending us email, or by registering or subscribing to our content, you provide your express consent to our disclosure of your Personal Data to our Subcontractors for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.
Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance
We are in compliance with the requirements of COPPA (Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act), as we do not collect any information from anyone under 13 years of age.  The Site and its content are directed to people who are at least 13 years of age or older.
