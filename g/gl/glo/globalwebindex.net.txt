What we do
Our aim is to help companies understand how and why people use the internet, and how they feel about various brands, products, services and marketing campaigns. As such, we conduct regular research across the world, speaking to millions of people each year to ask them what they do on the internet, which devices they own, and what their views are on a wide range of topics.
Using the results of our research, we help our clients to understand the anonymized characteristics and demographics of the people who visit their sites, use their products and services or see their advertising. Put simply, we help brands and organizations to understand online audiences.
Changes to this Privacy Policy
We may change this policy from time to time.

How we use your data
Use of Identity Data
We may use your Identity Data for contact and communication purposes to contact you in connection with your use of our services, including to provide you with reports and statistics regarding the use of our services and to investigate and resolve support or customer service queries. We may use your Identity Data to send you marketing communications from time to time, to provide you with news about any of our events, and/or other information about us and the services that we provide that we believe may be of interest to you.  You can specify your contact preferences when registering to receive communications from us (for example, when you submit a form through the globalwebindex website) or by subsequently advising us of your contact preferences or managing your email preferences.
Use of Browsing Data and Technical Data
As soon as you visit our website, we begin tracking Browsing Data and Technical Data.  This information about your general internet usage helps us to improve our website and deliver a better and more personalised service; for example, we store information about your preferences so that we can recognise you when you return to our site, speed up your searches and customise our site according to your individual interests.  We also use it for system administration, such as counting visitor numbers and seeing how they move around our site, enabling us to improve the way our website works.  We may also use it to report aggregate information to our advertisers.  This data is statistical and does not identify you as an individual.
Use of Automated processing
We do, from time to time, process personal data about Individuals in an automated way to evaluate certain personal aspects about such Individual, including to enable us to analyse and make predictions about their interests and how they are likely to interact with our business and which of our services may be of interest to them.  This is commonly referred to as profiling and it is our way of providing Individuals with a more bespoke customer experience based on how we think the Individual will engage with us. We may choose to send a particular marketing communication to an Individual based on our calculation of which of our services may be of most interest to them.
The personal data about you that we process for profiling purposes includes your Identity Data, your Contact Data and your Marketing Data.
Whilst our automated processing would constitute profiling under the EU data protection legislation, no decisions are made solely as a result of such automated processing.

We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. We have set out below, in a table format, a description of the ways we plan to use your personal data, and which of the legal bases we rely on to do so. We have also identified what our legitimate interests are where appropriate.

Promotional offers from us
We may use your Identity, Technical, Usage and Marketing Data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which of our services and offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing).
You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us or purchased services from us or if you provided us with your details when you entered a competition, registered for a promotion or when you complete a form on our website to download some of our content and, in each case, you have not opted out of receiving that marketing.

Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your device when you visit a website. When you participate in our research, we and/or our third-party partners may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your device until you delete them or they expire – usually after 1 year).  Further detail in relation to the cookies that we and/or our third-party partners may use are set out in our cookies policy here.
We and our partners use cookies to provide you with the best possible user experience, and also to track your online activity for the following purposes:
To improve your experience on our website. As discussed elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, we track your browsing activity, patterns and preferences to enable us to provide you with the best user experience; for example, to customise our content (such as language) to your location.
To measure user engagement on our website. We track the activity of users to our website to understand which parts of our website are most popular with visitors to our site. We may use this information to understand which of our services may be of interest to you.
Important note about cookies: When you visit our website, we will ask you to consent to our and our third-party partners’ setting and reading cookies from your browser.
We always want you to be in control of the information you share with us, and there are a number of ways that you can remove or block cookies at any time, including by following the help file directions in your internet browser. But if you want to tell us right now that you don’t want us to use cookies, then you can opt-out of this process here.
When you opt out, we delete the existing values in our cookie on your device and replace them with an “opt out” value which tells our server not to continue to track your behaviour, and we will ignore all subsequent requests coming from your browser. Please note that if you block cookies, our opt-out process may not function properly. Please also note that if you choose to opt-out now, but then at some point later you decide to delete, block, or otherwise restrict cookies, or if you use a different device or internet browser, you will need to renew your opt-out choice.
If you decide you want to opt-out of our cookie process at some point in the future rather than now, you can always come back to this Trendstream opt-out page.
Disclosures of your personal data
We may disclose your data to third parties such as:
Other members of our group of companies;
Authorised third-party service providers who provide IT and administration services to us to help us to provide our services, including the provider of our CRM system and other software solutions used by us in the provision of our services;
Other third party data processors for analytics and communication purposes, to help us to provide our services;
Bounce Exchange, Inc. (“BounceX”), a third party service provider, acting as a controller, engaged by us to provide device fingerprinting services which enable us to record certain characteristics of the devices used by users accessing our service to ensure such access is in accordance with the terms and conditions for our services. BounceX will process your personal data in accordance with its privacy policy available at https://www.bouncex.com/privacy.
Professional advisers including lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers who provide consultancy, banking, legal, insurance and accounting services;
Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets; or where we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them; and
Third parties where we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation.
We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy notice.
Please note that although we will not use the information that we receive, or any Technical Data, to identify you, we can never fully know what other information a third party holds about you already, and it may be that third parties are able to link the information we provide to other information that you have previously shared directly with them. For example, third parties such as our clients (and our clients’ own clients) are likely to have databases of their own, and it may be that you have consented to them holding information about you that could allow them to match their records with the data we supply. Similarly, if we share data with social networks, it may be that they can match our data with the other information that you have permitted them to hold about you. Please note that third parties should only lawfully be able to undertake this “matching” if you have given them specific permission to hold and use your data in such a way.
International transfers
We share your personal data with other companies within our group. This will involve transferring your data outside the European Economic Area ( EEA ). Some of our external third-party service providers are based outside the European EEA so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.
Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission.
Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data adequate protection.
Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide an equivalent level of protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US.
Data security
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
Where we have given you, or you have chosen, a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential.  We ask you not to share your password with anyone.
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Unfortunately the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure, and although we will do our best to protect your data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to us; and therefore any transmission is at your own risk.
Data retention
We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
Your legal rights
Under certain circumstance, you have the right under data protection laws in relation to your personal data:
The right of access: your right to obtain confirmation as to whether or not personal data are being processed, and, where that is the case, access to the personal data along with details regarding the nature of processing.
The right of rectification: your right to obtain the rectification of inaccurate personal data.
The right of portability: your right to receive your personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format.
The right to be forgotten: your right to erase your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it.
The right to restrict processing: your right for your data to be effectively ‘frozen’; stored and not further processed.
The right to object: your right to object to how your personal data is processed where we are re relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party).
If you would like exercise one of your rights listed above please send an email to privacy@globalwebindex.com.
Please use the email template below to confirm the right you wish to exercise together with details of the data in respect of which you are exercising such right.
Subject:
Body:
The EU data protection legislation also contains a right for you not to be subject to a decision made solely on automated processing, which includes profiling. As mentioned above, no decisions are made by us in relation to our use of your data which are based on automated processing without human intervention.
Please note, where we process your information for statistical purposes, certain of the above rights may not be available to you. Please contact us for further information on which of the above rights will not apply to our processing of personal data for statistical purposes.
You have the right, at any time, to make a complaint to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), the supervisory authority for data protection issues in the UK (phone: 0303 123 1113 or at www.ico.org.uk/concerns). However, we would appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the ICO, so please feel free to contact us in the first instance using the contact details provided below.
What we may need from you
Where you wish to exercise one of the rights listed above, we may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
Where we are not able to determine with any degree of certainty whether the information requested by you relates exclusively to you, our disclosure of such information to you may pose a privacy risk to a third party (for example, where a cookie is associated with a device used by more than one person). We will assess each request to exercise any of the rights listed above individually on its merits and will disclose the requested information where we are satisfied that such disclosure does not represent a privacy risk to any third party.
