We are committed to protecting your privacy online whilst providing a personalised and valuable experience. Collecting personal information is important so that we can meet the expectations and needs of our supporters and partners.  It is also a legal requirement for some of the things Global Witness does such as processing donations. We take care to ensure that we use your personal data in accordance with applicable laws.
The legal basis for Global Witness to process your personal information process depends upon the circumstances in which we collect and use this data. In most cases our processing of your personal information will fall into one of the following categories:

Legal obligation: where the processing of your personal information is necessary for us to comply with a legal obligation such as auditing of donations
Legitimate interests: in relying on this exemption we will determine how to process your data in a way that fits with Global Witness’s legitimate interests and yet is proportionate in relation to any privacy issues
