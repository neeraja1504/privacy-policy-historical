Although personal information will be predominately collected from the individual, personal information may also be obtained with the consent of the individual from other sources (i.e. credit bureaus, financial institutions, etc). Nevertheless, any information obtained from such other sources will be subject to GLWiz's privacy policy as if the information originated from the individual him/herself. General contact information is used to send products, information, fulfill orders or get in touch with users, if necessary, to solve problems. Financial information is used to check the user's qualifications and bill the user for products and services ordered by the user.
(a) Linked Sites and Affiliates :
Personal information collected from GLWiZ's affiliates, agencies and related institutions may also be combined with information obtained online at GLWiZ's website or at any of GLWiz's customer service centres.

(c) Disclosure required by law or under special circumstances :
GLWiZ will access, collect and/or disclose personal information where required to do so by law pursuant to a search warrant, court order or other valid legal request, or under special circumstances where there exists a good faith belief that such access, collection and/or disclosure are warranted.

GLWiZ may also disclose personal information to collection agencies for the purposes of collecting on accounts owing to GLWiz.

GLWiz will provide the individual with particulars as to the disclosure of his/her personal information and shall provide the individual with access to that information. The individual will be able to challenge the accuracy and completeness of the information and have it amended as appropriate.
To gain access to personal information held by GLWiZ the individual making the request will be required to provide sufficient information to permit GLWiZ to provide an account of the existence, use and disclosure of the personal information. In particular, verification of identity by user identification or password will be required before access to personal information is granted.
