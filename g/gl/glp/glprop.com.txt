Collecting Information
In general, you can visit this website without revealing who you are or any information about yourself.

You reserve the right of offering your confidential data to the website, and please do not submit your confidential data if you do not want it being collected.
Our web servers collect the domain names of visitors. Similar to many websites, our web servers also seek to place a "cookie" (a small data file) on your computer's hard drive which allows the server to determine the computer when it visits again, in order to track statistical information about navigation to and throughout certain areas of this website. This is used to help improve this website navigation and to measure the effectiveness of the overall website experience. It is not shared with anyone other than GLP affiliates and contractors who assists GLP in these efforts and are bound to confidentiality. However, if you prefer not to accept cookies, you can set your browser to reject them or to alert you before one is placed.

When other information is collected from you, such as your name and e-mail address, we generally let you know at the time of collection how it will be used.
The personal information you provide may be stored and processed in which GLP or its affiliates conduct operations. By submitting such information, you consent to the transfer of such information outside your home country.
Security of Information Collected
