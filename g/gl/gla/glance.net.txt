International or Cross-Border Transfer of Your Personal Information and Your Express Consent
Given that the Internet operates in a global environment and that transfer of your data is necessary to provide you with requested Services, to provide updates, and to respond to your inquiries, using the Internet to collect and process Personal Information necessarily involves the transmission of data on an international, or cross-border, basis. By providing Personal Information and/or by communicating with us by email, you acknowledge and expressly consent to our processing and disclosure of your Personal Information in this way. The Personal Information of users who are located outside the U.S. may be transferred outside of each eligible country to the U.S., where our servers are located and where it will be processed and stored on servers in the U.S. In addition, the servers and storage we use to provide you services are provided by Cloud vendors (primarily Amazon Web Services, but possibly other vendors as well). Your personal information is stored there. Although the Privacy Shield Principles have been recognized as adequate, the U.S. has not been recognized as providing an adequate level of protection according to EU or Swiss data protection requirements, but we will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that users’ Personal Information is treated securely in respect of such transfer and as described in this Privacy Policy and in accordance with the Principles. By accessing the Site, using the Services, providing Personal Information or sending us email, you expressly, explicitly and unambiguously consent to such transfer, processing, storage and disclosure in countries outside the EU.
Notice to Swiss residents: It is also possible that U.S. authorities may access data that is transferred to the U.S.  Glance will undertake to support affected data subjects to exercise their rights vis-à-vis foreign authorities in any way possible.
