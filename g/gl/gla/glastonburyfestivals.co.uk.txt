DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY
We do from time to time ask people for their personal details in forms to subscribe for specific information or entering applications electronically. Personal information collected via this website and the registration process is controlled by Glastonbury Festivals Limited (the data controller). This data is only held for the specified purpose made clear at the time of collection. Your data will only ever be shared with a third party for explicit, necessary processing purposes; for instance:
See Tickets is the Data Processor of your registered personal information. See Tickets have access to your registered personal information for the sole purpose of maintaining your registration details and processing ticket bookings and ticket related enquiries. See Tickets will not use this information to contact you about anything other than the Festival (however you may still receive communication from them if you have made other third party purchases with them independently).

Neither our accommodation providers nor WaterAid will use this information to contact you about anything other than your booking (however you may still receive communication from them if you have made other bookings with them or opted in to their mailing lists independently).
From May 2018, the Festival mailing list (previously administered on the Vice-Versa CRM System) will be processed by SeeTickets’ mail system on the Festival’s behalf. See Tickets will act as the Data Processor on behalf of the Festival. The Festival reserves the right to appoint a new Data Processor for the mailing list. Whilst the Festival newsletter data is stored and processed by See Tickets, it is entirely separate to SeeTickets’ own mailing list, and neither they nor any other third parties will be given access to use your data for any other purposes.
All Data Processors will act only on instructions from the Festival.
Please note that sometimes we will require you to provide additional personal information, and sometimes sensitive personal information. When we do this we will provide further details about why we are collecting your information and how we will use it.
We comply with all relevant data protection laws in all our dealings with your personal data, and we will ensure that our Data Processors do the same.

To contact you with information about your ticket registration, ticket or accommodation purchase (either directly or via its data processors e.g. See Tickets or Vice Versa)
To contact you about a submission you have made, including any content you provide for the website, or CVs or applications uploaded to our contact form.
To deal with your requests and enquiries;
To use IP addresses and device identifiers to identify the location of users, to block disruptive use, to establish the number of visits from different countries, and to determine whether you are accessing the services from the UK or not.
For analysis and research purposes so that we may improve the services offered by the Festival. This can include using geo-demographic information from external sources, to ensure that localised services (such as the local ticket area) are protected.
To notify you of any changes to the Festival’s policies and practices.
We may also use and disclose anonymised information in aggregate (so that no individuals are identified) for marketing and strategic development purposes.

DATA RETENTION
We will hold your personal information on our systems for as long as is necessary for the relevant activity, as outlined in the privacy statement for each specific data process.
As an annual event, we recognise that just because you have not used your registration details to purchase a ticket in one year, does not mean you have no intention of using your registration to purchase a ticket in future.
If you no longer wish to be registered to apply for tickets for the Festival you may delete your registration at any time (as long as you do not have a current booking).
CREW AND PERFORMER DATA
Whether you are volunteering as a steward, or headlining the Pyramid Stage, you or your representatives will be required to supply a certain amount of personal data in order for the Festival to fulfil your contract, supply your accreditation, or contact you in case of an emergency. The personal information provided as part of the Glastonbury Festival artist and crew advancing processes will be stored and processed by the respective area of the Festival you are working/performing at, and by the Festival’s central functions for passes and finance administration. Where the data may be processed by a third party processor on the Festival’s behalf, this will be outlined in the specific area’s privacy statement. The personal data you supply will be retained for a maximum of 5 Festival cycles before being securely deleted. Your information will never be shared with or sold to other third parties.
In addition to the basic information provided in order to fulfil our contractual obligations, we will also use some of the personal data provided by artists to compile our line up listings. This will include the performer’s name and social media handles (if they have a public profile). The line-up listings are shared with third party companies, such as our media partners (BBC, EE and The Guardian, as well the companies who process data on their behalf) in order to publish line-up information across their platforms; as well as being publicly available on the line-up page of the Festival website. We believe this is in the legitimate interest of both the Festival and the artists performing at the Festival, as artists derive a benefit from being featured across these platforms, however any artist who wishes to have their information removed from or amended on these listings, has the right to deletion or rectification, as described in ‘YOUR RIGHTS’ below.
