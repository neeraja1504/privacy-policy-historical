This privacy notice explains how the University of Glasgow’s Development & Alumni Office (DAO) collects, manages, uses and protects your data. It outlines the types of data we hold and how we use that data to provide services to our alumni and supporters, and manage their interaction with the University.
The DAO is part of the University of Glasgow, and the University is the data controller. You can find out more about the University’s data protection policies at gla.ac.uk/myglasgow/dpfoioffice
Our legal basis for processing your data
The DAO processes and stores personal information relating to alumni, students and staff, as well as current and potential supporters and friends of the University including those who attend University events. Alumni include graduates, former students receiving non-graduating qualifications and former exchange students.
All graduates of the University of Glasgow are members of the General Council, the graduate and academic body of the University. As part of our public task the University has a statutory obligation to retain a list of General Council members, to conduct General Council elections and to inform members about General Council activities. You can find out more about the General Council at gla.ac.uk/explore/generalcouncil.
For purposes other than General Council membership, the DAO processes the information outlined in this notice in pursuit of our legitimate interests in:
communicating with alumni, students, staff, events attendees, and current and potential supporters
providing benefits and services to alumni, students, staff, friends and supporters
furthering the University’s educational charitable mission (including fundraising and securing the support of volunteers)
enabling the University to achieve its strategic and operational goals.
We may contact you by post, email, phone, text and/or social media. Where appropriate, the DAO will sometimes process your data on an alternative legal basis – for example, where you have given your consent for us to do so.
Where your data comes from
Most of the data held by the DAO is obtained directly from our alumni, donors and friends. Core alumni information is carried over from their student record. We may receive data from the colleges, schools or units within the University. Data is also collected directly from alumni such as when they update their details online, return an alumni questionnaire or donation form, meet with one of our team or attend an event.
Some information may also come from reliable, public sources. For example, the Electoral Register or the National Change of Address Register.
The data we hold
We hold the following types of information about our alumni, supporters and friends.
Your name, title, gender, and date of birth if we have it.
Your preferred postal address and any known previous address, as well as email addresses and telephone numbers.
If you are an alumnus/a, your University qualification(s) or those gained from predecessor institutions. For some alumni, we may hold course information and details of your membership of clubs, societies and alumni groups as well as any scholarships or awards held as a student.
A log of our interactions with you, including agreed notes from any meetings with you, communications we have sent or if we have received communication from you, if we asked for your support, or invited you to an event and any event attendance.
Communication preferences, such as whether you receive Avenue by post or email, or if you have told us you do not want any contact from us.
We may also hold some of the following, based on the information you provide to us or, in some cases, from trustworthy public sources.
Donation information, including gift aid status (as required by HMRC).
Event-related information such as dietary or access requirements or car registration.
Your membership of the Network and your volunteering at the University.
Business details, such as job title, employer/ company name and contact information.
Your career highlights or other achievements, including media articles.
Links to social media accounts such as Linkedin.
The name of your partner/spouse and other family relationships, or connections you may have with other alumni and supporters of the University.
Information about your areas of interest, including your volunteering or philanthropic giving to other organisations.
Information about your ability to support the University, such as your income if you have told us, as well as information on publicly quoted remuneration.
How we use your data
We will use your details to manage your interaction with the University and to contact you by post, email, phone, text and/or social media, complying with any preferences you have expressed: see Your rights and preferences below. We contact you to
keep you informed of University news, and the achievements and advances being made by the University, its students and staff, and our alumni
tell you about the benefits of being an alumnus/a of the University, including discounts and services
invite you to events hosted by the University, partner organisations or your fellow alumni (for example reunions)
offer opportunities for you to engage with the University as an ambassador, volunteer, friend and supporter. This may include asking you for your financial support through making a gift to one of the projects which help to deliver the University’s mission of creating and sharing knowledge, or asking you to give your time to help students.
To use University resources efficiently and effectively we may use the data we hold to determine the support opportunities and communications most relevant to you. As part of that, we may consider your ability to give support (including financial ability) and may record this on our database. To support this activity, we may use automated or manual processes such as wealth screening to analyse and segment our data. On occasion, we may use trusted third parties to carry out this analysis. The DAO and these third parties may augment any analysis conducted using information from trustworthy public sources such as Companies House, news sources such as Nexis and specialist subscription services for both individual and company information, such as FAME. You will always have the opportunity to opt out of any of this processing: see Your rights and preferences below.
We may also use publicly available sources to carry out due diligence on financial supporters in line with our Gift Acceptance Policy and to meet money laundering and other regulations.
If you provide contact information, and unless you specify otherwise, we will assume this includes consent for us to use that data for the purposes listed above. For example, if you provide us with a telephone number registered with the Telephone Preference Service, we will assume you are happy for us to use this number for the purposes stated above. If we lose touch with you, we may use publicly available contact details to re-establish our connection and seek your permission to update your contact details. You can manage your communications preferences at any time.
The University has a legal obligation to supply information about our graduates for certain statutory surveys. For example, we provide contact information to the Higher Education Statistics Authority for the purposes of the Graduate Outcomes survey. This is regulated by the UK Statistics Authority.
Protecting your data
The personal information we obtain is processed in accordance with all relevant data protection legislation. When this legislation is amended or replaced, we review and update our data processing practices accordingly.
Your data is always securely processed and transmitted, protecting against unauthorised or unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction or damage. Your data will not be disclosed to any external organisations except for those acting as agents for the University under defined written agreements. Data is never “sold” to third parties. Limited data may be shared with affiliates of the University such as senior volunteers serving on our boards. This information is shared only for University purposes and is not retained by the affiliate for longer than necessary.
Some of your data may be anonymised and shared with a third party to help with the preparation and management of our fundraising. None of your data is retained by the third party once the process is complete or used by them for any other purpose.
If you engage with the University through a third party (for example, supporting the University via JustGiving or through a gift to a partner such as American Alumni of Glasgow University in the USA) then we may obtain information about you from that third party. Data obtained in this way is bound by the terms of this privacy notice.
While we are happy to facilitate communication between individual alumni, we will never pass on your details without prior permission.
From time to time it may be necessary to share some of your information to trusted third parties outside the EEA. For example, event venues may require details of attendees for safety and security purposes. We will seek your consent to use data for these purposes and ensure these third parties provide an adequate level of protection in accordance with UK data protection law.
Your rights and preferences
The DAO considers its relationship with alumni and supporters to be lifelong. We will always try to ensure that the data we hold for you is up to date, reasonable and not excessive. You always have the right to:
be informed as to how we use your data (via this privacy notice)
access or request a copy of the data we hold about you (see below)
update your information and/or manage your communications preferences at any time
opt out of specific types of processing
ask us to remove your data from our records (see below)
withdraw consent, where it is used as a legal basis for processing.
At any time, you can
update your details at gla.ac.uk/alumni/reconnect/updateyourdetails
specify your communication preferences at gla.ac.uk/alumni/communicationpreferences
contact us at alumni@glasgow.ac.uk to tell us about your preferences.
If you are an alumnus/a and exercise your right to be removed from our database, we will maintain some core data (name, qualification information, General Council number, date of birth) for archive purposes and to ensure we do not contact you inadvertently in future. If you are a donor, we may also need to retain some financial records for the period of time required for statutory purposes (for example Gift Aid, anti-fraud and accounting matters).
