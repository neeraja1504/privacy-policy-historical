II. Consignment and Consignee Data
Data Categories, Purposes of Processing Personal Data and Legal Basis
For carrying out parcel services and therefore fulfilling the contract with its customers (the consignors) [According to Art. 6 (1)(b) GDPR] including in particular delivery of the parcel, payment of services, complaints management, quality and safety management, statistical performance data and compliance with relevant government bodies such as the Revenue Commission GLS needs consignor data (address details and further contact details, payment information and other relevant contractual data according to the services ordered by the consignor) as well as consignee data (name, address, postcode, city, country, optionally phone no. and e-mail address).
Consignee data transferred to GLS companies as well as interface documentation (scans of the parcels at different locations) and the proof of delivery (POD) may be processed and recorded by various GLS subsidiaries. GLS uses personal consignment and consignee data only for the fulfilment of its contractual obligations. Any further use is not permitted.
In some cases we may process data on consent basis [According to Art. 7 GDPR] or because of our legitimate interest [According to Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR] (in particular regarding the following purposes: customer solvency checks, Compliance programme).
Responsibility
Compliance with the applicable statutory regulations on data protection is an original duty of each GLS company. The transfer of data by a consignor to a GLS company is no processing of data on behalf of others.
Additional services like the FlexDeliveryService and ShopDeliveryService require the e-mail address or phone number of the consignee to inform him/her about the status of the parcel delivery. GLS companies receive the telephone number and/or e-mail address from the consignor who ordered these additional services. The consignor is also responsible for the proper collection of this data and in particular the consent of the consignee to the transfer of his e-mail address and/or telephone number to GLS.
If you have questions regarding this procedure, please contact your contractual partner (the consignor). You can also express your withdrawal of consent towards GLS B.V.
