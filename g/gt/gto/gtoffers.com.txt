(As used herein, "online" means using the Internet, including the Website, and related technologies, and "offline" means by methods other than online, including in person, in the postal mail, using telephones and cell phones, and other similar means.) In the Surveys, Mobile Plus, Inc. or a third party (a "Third Party") may ask an individual to provide various information to Mobile Plus, Inc., which may include his or her name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), SMS messaging details (e.g. date, time and content of the SMS message), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, social security number, employment information, personal and online interests, and such other information as may be requested from time to time (together, "Survey Information"). Mobile Plus, Inc. may also collect information concerning an individual from another source and use that information in combination with information provided from this Web Site. Completing the Surveys is completely voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to provide Survey Information to Mobile Plus, Inc. or Third Party, but an individual may receive incentives from Mobile Plus, Inc. or a Third Party in exchange for providing Survey Information to Mobile Plus, Inc..
1.2 Third Party List Information. Mobile Plus, Inc. collects information from individuals when an individual provides information to a Third Party and Mobile Plus, Inc. subsequently purchases, licenses, or otherwise acquires the information from the Third Party (the "Seller").

1.4 Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology. Mobile Plus, Inc. currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about an individual with information about the individual in our database. Additionally, Mobile Plus, Inc. may use other new and evolving sources of information in the future (together, "Technology Information"). (a) Cookies. A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individual's computer that allows Mobile Plus, Inc. to identify the individual with his or her corresponding data that resides in Mobile Plus, Inc.'s database. You may read more about cookies at http://cookiecentral.com. Individuals who use the Website need to accept cookies in order to use all of the features and functionality of the Website. (b) Web Beacons. A web beacon is programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page (by using an img src="x" programming function -- see http://truste.org for more information), but can also be used to transfer an individual's unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows Mobile Plus, Inc. to track certain web sites an individual visits online. Web beacons are used to determine products or services an individual may be interested in, and to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes. For example, Mobile Plus, Inc. might place, with the consent of a Third Party website, a web beacon on the Third Party's website where baseball products are sold. When Joe, an individual listed in Mobile Plus, Inc.'s database, visits the fishing website, Mobile Plus, Inc. receives notice by means of the web beacon that Joe visited the baseball site, and Mobile Plus, Inc. would then update Joe's profile with the information that Joe is interested in baseball. Mobile Plus, Inc. may thereafter present offers of baseball related products and services to Joe. In addition to using web beacons on web pages, Mobile Plus, Inc. also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in Mobile Plus, Inc.'s database. (c) in order to determine the web browser a visitor is using, to serve browser-appropriate content, and to optimize links depending on whether or not they have been visited by the user, Mobile Plus, Inc. may employ JavaScript which provides this information to Mobile Plus, Inc..(d) New Technology. The use of technology on the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly evolving, as is Mobile Plus, Inc.'s use of new and evolving technology. As a result, Mobile Plus, Inc. strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use of technology.
