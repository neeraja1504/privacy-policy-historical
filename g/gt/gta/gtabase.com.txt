What Are Cookies
A cookie is a small piece of text sent to your browser by a website you visit. It helps the website to remember your settings preferences, to register and keep you logged in to our forums, to make the ads you see more relevant to you, to count how many visitors we receive to a page, etc. That can make your next visit easier and the site more useful to you. Cookies play an important role. Without them, using the web would be a much more frustrating experience.
