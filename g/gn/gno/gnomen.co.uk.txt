Gnomen Privacy Statement:
Gnomen has created this privacy statement ("Statement") in order to demonstrate our commitment to customer privacy. Privacy on the gnomen (the "Site") is of great importance to us. Because we gather important information from our visitors and customers, we have established this Statement as a means to communicate our information gathering and dissemination practices. We reserve the right to change this Statement at any time.

We require customers who register to use the services offered on our Site (collectively, the "Service") to give us contact information, such as their name, company name, address, phone number, and e-mail address, and financial qualification and billing information, such as billing name and address, credit card number, and the number of users within the organization that will be using the Service.
Gnomen uses the information that we collect to set up the Service for individuals and their organizations. We may also use the information to contact customers to further discuss customer interest in our company, the Service that we provide, and to send information regarding our company or partners, such as promotions and events. Customers are invited to receive an email newsletter by providing an email address. Customer email addresses and any personal customer information will not be distributed or shared with third parties. Customers can opt out of being contacted by us, or receiving such information from us, at any time by sending an email to support@gnomen.co.uk. Separately, customers are also asked to provide an email address when registering for the Service, in order to receive a username and password. We may also email information regarding updates to the Service or company, and will send a Customer Newsletter. Again, email will not be distributed or shared and customers can opt out of receiving any communication by emailing support@gnomen at the time it is distributed, or at the time any customer registers for the Service.
Customers of the Service will be using the Site to host data and information ("Data"). Gnomen will not review, share, distribute, print, or reference any such Data except as may be required by law. Individual records may at times be viewed or accessed only for the purpose of resolving a problem, support issue, or suspected violation of the Agreement, or as may be required by law. Of course, customers are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of their user registration and password.

Cookies:
When you interact with the gnomen website we strive to make that experience easy and meaningful. When you come to our Web site, our Web server sends a cookie to your computer. Cookies are files that Web browsers place on a computer's hard drive and are used to tell us whether customers and visitors have visited the Site previously.
Standing alone, cookies do not identify you personally. They merely recognize your browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself to gnomen, either by responding to a promotional offer, or registering for a 30-day Trial, you remain anonymous to gnomen. Cookies come in two flavors: session and persistent-based. Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser software or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you've closed your browser or turned off your computer. They include such information as a unique identifier for your browser.
Gnomen uses session cookies containing encrypted information to allow the system to uniquely identify you while you are logged in. This information allows gnomen to process your online requests. Session cookies help us make sure you are who you say you are after you've logged in and are required in order to use the gnomen system. Gnomen uses persistent cookies, that only gnomen can read and use, to identify the fact that you are a gnomen customer. We are especially careful about the security and confidentiality of the information stored in persistent cookies. For example, we do not store account numbers or passwords in persistent cookies. Users who disable their Web browsers' ability to accept cookies will still be able to browse our Website.
Third Party Cookies: We may from time to time engage third parties to track and analyze non-personally identifiable usage and volume statistical information from visitors to our website to help us administer our website and improve its quality. Such third parties may use cookies to help track visitor behavior. Such cookies will not be used to associate individual website visitors to any personally identifiable information. All data collected by such third parties on behalf of gnomen.co.uk is used only to provide us with information on site usage and is not shared with any other third parties.
Security:
Our Site has security measures in place to help protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the Data under our control. Gnomen ensure that Data is safe, secure. Gnomen also implements an advanced security method based on dynamic data and encoded session identifications, and hosts the Site in a secure server environment that uses a firewall and other advanced technology to prevent interference or access from outside intruders. Finally, gnomen provides unique user names and passwords that must be entered each time a customer logs on. These safeguards help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of Data.
Additional Information:
Questions regarding this Statement or the practices of this Site should be directed to gnomen's Security Administrator by e-mailing such questions to security@gnomen.co.uk or by post addressed to Gnomen Ltd, Attn: Security Administrator, Studio 278, 77 Beak Street, Soho, London W1F 9DB.
