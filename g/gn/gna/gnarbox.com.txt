SHARING YOUR INFORMATION
We will share your Information as follows:
At Your Instruction
If you request us to make your Data available to a third party, and such request furthers the purposes of our Publications or the sale of our Products, we will do so.
Sharing with Vendors and Service Providers
In certain cases, we use the services of third-party vendors and service providers to assist us in providing the Publications and Products.  We may share your Data with such vendors and service providers solely for that purpose, and we will require those parties to abide by our privacy policies.
Third-Party Offers
We may allow other companies to offer you their products and publications, including offers through our Publications, co-branded pages hosted by the third parties, or via email. Whether or not you decide to participate in any such offers is up to you. If you purchase a product or service on a co-branded page, or via a third-party offer on our Publications that requires you to submit financial and personal information, you are also consenting to our delivery of this information to that party. The offer will notify you if any financial or personally identifiable information will be shared. Such third party will be authorized to use this information in keeping with our contractual relationship with them and in accordance with their own privacy policy and information practices.

Third-Party Ad Servers.
We may allow third party ad servers or ad networks to display advertisements on the Publications.

3. Ensure that your obligations of Data Secrecy and Confidentiality are observed forever, both during and after the expiration and/or termination of any agreement with us or any contractual relationship you may have with an employer or other party.
