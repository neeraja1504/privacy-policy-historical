INTEREST-BASED ADVERTISING
We work with third party advertising networks and other advertising and personalization partners that use their own tracking technologies (including cookies and pixel tags) on GM and non-GM websites and apps in order to provide you with tailored advertisements on our behalf across the Internet (including on social networking websites and apps). These companies may collect information about your activity over time and across your different devices on GM and non-GM websites and apps (such as web pages you visit and your interaction with our advertising and other communications) and use this information to make predictions about your preferences, develop personalized content and deliver ads that are more relevant to you on third party websites and apps. This information may also be used to evaluate our online advertising campaigns or to tailor promotions or other marketing messages to you across your devices.
GM adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada's Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (www.youradchoices.ca). If you do not wish to receive personalized advertising or content from participating third-party advertising companies while visiting GM web sites, you may click on the AdChoices icon or link located on the web site or visit the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada's Opt-Out page.

To successfully opt-out, you must have cookies enabled in your web browser. Please see your browser's instructions for information on cookies and how to enable them. Your opt-out only applies to the web browser you use so you must opt-out of each web browser on each device that you use.

When you buy or lease a vehicle from a GM dealer, the dealer will share your information with GM. Please be aware that each dealer operates as a separate legal entity and you should read the dealer's privacy statement to ensure that you understand its privacy practices and procedures. Additionally, because the GM dealer often is the first contact with you, the dealer can answer any questions you may have about its privacy practices.

When completing a purchase or lease agreement or signing a service repair order with the GM dealer, you should be provided with information describing the dealership's privacy practices and related policies that explain that certain personal information that you provide to the dealer may be shared with GM for some or all of the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.

HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION
We may keep the information we collect for as long as necessary to provide products or services to you, to operate our business, to enable us to communicate with you, for our safety, research, evaluation of use, or troubleshooting purposes, or to satisfy our legal or contractual obligations.
