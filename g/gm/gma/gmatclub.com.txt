We also collect information about you and your use of this website every time you visit, which may include site traffic statistics, page views, operating system and browser type, and IP addresses.

Improve the services of this website
Analyze the variables statistically (without identifying you)
Send email notifications that you have signed up for and requested to be sent to your email address (notifications of Wiki page edits, forum posts, and private messages)
GMAT Club will never share, sell, rent or disclose to third parties your personal information without obtaining your permission first (unless ordered by a Court of Law).
Occasionally we may employ member information for new unanticipated uses. In such cases we will post the policy changes here and notify you, providing an ability to withdraw your private information.

Tests Privacy Policy
Your scores and performance in GMAT Club Tests are recorded. This information is used to allow you to review you mistakes and compare your performance to other members; it also may be used to calibrate the test questions and perform statistical analysis of the response data. In all the use cases, your private performance information is made anonymous (username replaced by a numeric ID) prior to any analysis.
