Other online technologies we use may include Flash® objects (sometimes called "Local Shared Objects") as part of our online authentication measures if you ask us to remember your computer.

This information allows us to measure site activity and to create ideas for improving our sites and may include the time and length of your visit, the pages you look at on our sites, the website you visited just before coming to ours and your internet service provider. If we provide you with a link from an Ally site to another site, we may track the fact that you clicked the link. This will help us understand which links are helpful to you when you visit our site, and will help us provide you with links that may be of interest to you, when you visit our site again.
