GHS Notice of Privacy Practices - Greenville Health System
This Notice describes how medical information about you may be used and released and how you can get this information. Please read it carefully. _ _
Greenville Health System (GHS) makes every effort to keep your health information private. Each time you visit a GHS facility (doctor’s office, clinic, hospital or outpatient center), a record is made. This health or medical record often includes your symptoms, exams and tests, diagnoses, treatment, and care plan. We need this record to give you high-quality care and to meet legal requirements.
This Notice of Privacy Practices (hereafter referred to as Notice) applies to all health records produced at GHS, including those received from other providers. It outlines how we may use and give out information about you for treatment, payment or healthcare operations, and other purposes granted or required by law. It also describes your rights to get and control your record, and legal requirements we have on its use and release.
This Notice applies to all GHS sites, including offices of physicians employed by GHS and to all physicians and other healthcare providers who provide you with healthcare services at any GHS site through the Greenville Health System Organized Health Care Arrangement (please see the end of this document for a list of major GHS facilities). It does not apply to care you receive from physicians or other healthcare providers at their private offices (unless the physician or other healthcare provider is employed by GHS) or at any non-GHS site.
The law requires GHS to do the following:
Keep your health record private
Describe our legal duties and privacy obligations related to your health information
Follow the current Notice of Privacy Practices
Notify you if there is a breach of your unsecured personal health information (PHI)
We reserve the right to change the practices and terms of this Notice, and the changes will be effective for the information we already have about you as well as any information we receive in the future. The Notice will list the effective date in the top right-hand corner of the first page. Each time you register at or are admitted to GHS as an inpatient or outpatient, you may have a copy of the Notice. We will post it in our facilities and on our website ( www.ghs.org ). You also may call our Privacy Office at (864) 797-7755 for a copy or download a PDF version of this document by clicking here.
Routine Uses and Disclosures of Your Health Record
The following sections describe how we use and release medical information. Each section explains what we mean and gives a few examples.  (Note: These examples are not all-inclusive.)
Treatment
We use medical information about you to provide, coordinate and manage your treatment or services. We may give this information to doctors, nurses, specialists, technicians, students of affiliated healthcare programs, volunteers or other staff who care for you. Such people may share information about you to coordinate your needs, such as lab work or prescription drugs.
Here is how your health record might be used for treatment reasons:
A doctor treating your broken leg may need to know if you have diabetes, which slows healing. Also, the doctor may need to tell the dietitian that you have diabetes to arrange for special meals.
We may send your record to specialists your doctors here may want to consult.
Your record may be sent to a doctor to whom you have been referred.
We would share your record with a facility you are being transferred to or one that you are considering transfer to once you leave GHS.
We may use and release your health record to provide material on treatment options.
Payment
We use and release health information so that treatment and services you receive may be billed to and payment collected from you, an insurance company or a third party.
Here is how your health record might be used for payment purposes:
We may call your health plan for pre-approval of a service to determine whether your treatment will be covered.
We may give your health plan details about your care, so it will pay us or reimburse you. For example, if you have a broken leg, we may need to give your health plan(s) information about your condition and supplies used.
We may use and disclose your health information to other providers so that they may bill and collect payment for treatment and services they provided to you.
We may share your health information with billing and collection departments or agencies, insurance companies and health plans to collect payment for services, departments that review the appropriateness of the care provided and the costs associated with that care, and to consumer reporting agencies (for instance, credit bureaus).
Healthcare Operations
We may use and release your record to support our business functions (such as administrative, financial and legal activities). These uses and disclosures are needed to run the hospital, support treatment and payment, and help patients receive high-quality care. Activities may include measuring quality, reviewing employee performance and training students.
Here is how your health record might be used for healthcare operations:
Reviewing and improving the quality, efficiency, and cost of care that we provide to you and other patients
Evaluating the skills, qualifications, and performance of healthcare providers taking care of you
Providing training programs for students, trainees, healthcare provide non-healthcare professionals (for example, billing clerks) to help them practice or improve their skills
Facility Directory
We may include certain facts about you in our directory while you are a patient at a GHS hospital, clinic or doctor’s office. These facts may include your name, location, general condition (such as fair or stable) and religious affiliation. They also may be shared with those who ask for you by name (except for religious affiliation). Your affiliation may be given to clergy members—even if they don’t ask for you by name— so family members, friends and clergy can visit you or know how you are doing. However, if you do not want your information listed in the hospital directory, please notify Registration when you arrive or call the facility’s Admitting Office.
People Involved in Your Care or Payment for Your Care
We may share your health information with a family member, friend, or other person you identify or who is involved in your care or payment for your care details about you that relate to that person’s involvement in your care. However, GHS respects your right to choose not to have your information shared. If you cannot physically or mentally agree or object to a disclosure, we may supply information where necessary. We also may share facts with someone helping in a disaster relief effort so that family can know of your condition, status and location.
Business Associates
Business associates of GHS provide some services related to treatment, payment and business operations. For example, we may use a copy service to make copies of your medical record. When we hire companies to perform these services, we may disclose your health information to these companies so that they can perform the job we have asked them to do. We have a written agreement that requires associates to protect your record in the course of performing their job.
Special Uses and Disclosures of Your Health Record
Emergencies
We may use or release your health information during emergencies.
Research
Under certain circumstances, we may use and disclose health information about you for research purposes. All research projects, however, are subject to a special approval process. Before we use or disclose medical information for research, the project will have been approved through this research approval process. We may, however, use health information about you in preparing to conduct a research project, for example, to look for patients with specific needs.
Fundraising Events
GHS is a nonprofit health system that relies on generous support from patients and families to continue vital healthcare, research and education operations. We may use your demographic information such as name, address and birthday to contact you regarding fundraising opportunities. We also may use the dates you received treatment or services, department of service, outcomes information and treating information. You have the right to elect not to receive fundraising communications. Please contact us at (864) 797-7749 (Office of Philanthropy & Partnership) if you wish to have your name removed from the list to receive fundraising requests supporting GHS in the future. Your decision not to receive fundraising communications will have no impact on your ability to receive healthcare services at any GHS facility.

You have the right to request that we limit information we use or give out about you for treatment, payment or healthcare operations.

You have the right to request that we not disclose to your health plan health information or services for which you paid out of pocket before the performance of those services.
We are not required to agree to your request. If we do agree, we will comply with your request unless the material is needed for emergency treatment.

You have the right to request that we interact with you about medical matters in a certain way or place. For example, you can ask that we contact you only by mail or at work.
