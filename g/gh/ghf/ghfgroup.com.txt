HOW DO WE STORE PERSONAL INFORMATION AND FOR HOW LONG?
Safeguarding the privacy of your information is important to us, whether you interact with us personally, by phone, by mail, over the internet or any other electronic medium. We hold personal information in a combination of secure computer storage facilities and paper-based files and other records, and take steps to protect the personal information we hold from misuse, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. When we consider that personal information is no longer needed, we will remove any details that will identify you or we will securely destroy the records. However, we may need to maintain records for a significant period of time. For example, we are subject to certain anti-money laundering laws which require us to retain:
a copy of the documents we used to comply with our customer due diligence obligations; and
supporting evidence and records of transactions with you and your relationship with us, for a period of five years after our business relationship with you has ended.
If we hold any personal information in the form of a deed, we will hold this deed in its complete form for a period of 12 years after our business relationship with you has ended. If we hold any personal information in the form of a recorded communication, by telephone, electronic, in person or otherwise, this information will be held in line with local regulatory requirements which will either be 5 years or 10 years after our business relationship with you has ended. Where you have opted out of receiving marketing communications we may hold your details on our suppression list so that we know you do not want to receive these communications but we will not send you marketing communications.
