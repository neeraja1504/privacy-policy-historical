While you can use many features of our Web site without being required to provide personally identifiable information, you may be requested to provide your personal information to gain access to some of our content or services, to contact us, or to receive additional information from us. Providing the appropriate selection will identify your understanding of the practices described in the Internet Privacy statement. The framework for utilizing data is outlined in this privacy policy.
How We Collect and Use Personal Information
We may collect personal information about you when you visit http://www.goemerchant.com, which may give you the ability to access additional features on our Web site and our online services. This information is used to provide you with the information that you are requesting from us, access to our services and data and information regarding the services we provide to you and/or your customers. Personal information we collect may include: your login ID and password, your name, your company name, your mailing address, your e-mail address, your phone number, your fax number and additional information used to contact you.
Automatic Information
We may also collect automatic information about your visit to our Web site, such as time of day, browser type and version, browser language, your operating system and platform, and the Internet Protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet. This information is used for analytical purposes and to help us provide services to our clients. We may also use this information to administer and troubleshoot our Web site and servers.
How We Protect Your Personal Information
We have taken precautions to protect your personal information under our control from misuse, loss or alteration. Our security measures include industry standard technology and equipment to help protect your data. Unfortunately, however, no system can ensure complete security and you should take all necessary steps to protect your information and its transmission to us. Since the Internet is a public medium, we cannot guarantee the protection of your personal information.
How We Use "Cookies"
"Cookies" are small pieces of information that some Web sites store on your computer's hard drive when you visit them. Like many other Web sites, we may use cookies to identify users and their preferences for our business purposes.
What We Provide to Third-Parties
Certain third parties may need access to some of your personal information. For example, we may need to share your name and address with your employer, government regulators, or our service providers. In such cases, we provide third parties with only the minimum amount of information that we determine, in our discretion, is needed to complete the requested service or transaction. We may also provide your information to our affiliated companies and successors.
We reserve the right to provide third parties with aggregate statistics about our clients, traffic patterns, and related site information. This data reflects site usage patterns, but typically does not contain personally identifiable information about any individual user.
Linked Web Sites
We may provide links to third-party sites. Because we do not control these Web sites, we encourage you to review the privacy policies posted on these third-party Web sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such Web sites or the information collected on such Web sites.

As a registered site user, you give us and our agents permission to send you e-mails or place phone calls to you related to the information that you request.
Opt Out
We respect your privacy and ability to choose whether to share information with us and any third party. You may choose to “opt-out” of sharing personal information in several ways.
