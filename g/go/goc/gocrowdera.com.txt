Crowdera- The Free Global Crowdfunding & Fundraising Website
We at Crowdera Inc. (" Crowdera ") have created this privacy policy (this " Privacy Policy ") because we know that you care about how information you provide to us is used and shared. This Privacy Policy relates to the information collection and use practices of Crowdera in connection with our Services, which are made available to you through the Platform.
By visiting our Website and/or using our Services on the Platform, you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the accompanying Terms of Use.
Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning set forth in our Terms of Use.
The Information We Collect
1. Personal Information
When you sign up to become a Campaign Administrator or Supporter, enter any promotion, contest, or sweepstakes, or sign up for our newsletter or other publications, you will be required to provide us with personal information about yourself, which may include your name, address, e-mail address, and phone number.
If you elect to sign in to the Platform using Facebook Connect or Twitter Connect, you are authorizing Crowdera to collect, store, and use, in accordance with this Privacy Policy, any and all information that you agreed that Facebook, Inc. (" Facebook ") or Twitter, Inc. (" Twitter ") could provide to Crowdera through Facebook's or Twitter's Application Programming Interface (" API "). Such information may include, without limitation, your first and last name, Facebook or Twitter username, Facebook or Twitter profile picture, unique Facebook or Twitter identifier and access token, and e-mail address. Facebook Connect and Twitter Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on the Platform to your profile page to share with others within your network or opt out of information you do not wish to share.
All information collected pursuant to this section is collectively referred to as " Personal Information." We do not collect or access any Personal Information from you when you use the Services unless you provide us with the Personal Information voluntarily or authorize us to access it.
2. Billing Information
When Supporters wish to make Donations or Contributions, they will be required to provide certain information in addition to the Personal Information noted above. Such information may include a debit card number, credit card number, expiration date, bank account information, billing address, activation codes, and similar information. Such information is collectively called the " Billing Information ". Donations and Contributions are collected and processed by our third-party vendor pursuant to the terms and conditions of its privacy policy, and we do not obtain access to any Billing Information in connection with these transactions. We do, however, obtain access to Billing Information provided by Campaign Administrators, because we pay out the Net Proceeds and need access to this information to make the payments.
3. Other Information
In addition to the Personal Information and Billing Information that you voluntarily provide to us, we may collect additional information (collectively, the " Other Information "). Such Other Information may include:
From You. Additional information about yourself or your organization that you voluntarily provide to us, such as product and service preferences and other information that does not identify you personally.
