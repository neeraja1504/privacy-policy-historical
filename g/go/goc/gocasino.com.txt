GoCasino.Com - Online Casino
This GoCasino.com Privacy Statement discloses the information privacy practices for GoCasino.com's Web site, www.GoCasino.com
Our Commitment
Your online privacy is important to us here at GoCasino.com. To better protect your privacy we explain here our information practices about the way your information is collected and used. This statement is available via a link from our home page (http://www.GoCasino.com) and is available directly at (http://www.GoCasino.com/privacy.php).
Information Collected About You
GoCasino.com collects two forms of personally identifiable information ('PII') online: Web Server log file analysis information ('Traffic Analysis') and Web visitor registration information ('User Information') voluntarily provided to GoCasino.com by visitors who log onto the site. User Information includes information that can identify you as a specific individual, such as your name, phone number, or e-mail address. Although you are required to register as a player at GoCasino.com in order to use our online gaming software, participate in the contests, and complete transactions, many areas of GoCasino.com can be accessed without providing any User Information.
Traffic Analysis
GoCasino.com routinely gathers Information on Site activity, such as data on how many people visit the Site, the pages they visit, where they come from, how long they stay, which banner they have clicked onto arrive at our site, etc.
Such Traffic Analysis is:
* collected on an aggregate, anonymous basis, which means no PII is associated with this data, unless such user arrives from an affiliate, in which case we must track PII to compensate our affiliate;
* gathered through the use of web server logs and cookies. A web server log is a file where web site activity is stored. A cookie is a small piece of information that a web site sends to a visitor's computer and which is then stored on the visitor's hard drive. GoCasino.com uses cookies to track repeat visits to its Site. Although GoCasino.com assigns a cookie to a visitor's computer, it does not know who that visitor is unless that person specifically tells us by becoming a registered user.
* used to better design our Site, improve how we provide you with information on our products, customer service and to share with advertisers/affiliates to create targeted marketing.
GoCasino.com collects certain technical information from your computer each time you request a page during a visit. This information is collected from your computer's Web browser to enhance your experience on our site and may include your IP address, operating system, Web browser software (e.g., Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer), screen resolution, and referrer Web site.

How We Use Your Information
We use the Information you provide about yourself when registering and to provide you with information about other partner's similar products and promotions that may be of interest to you. Your Information may be shared with our employees, independent contractors, agents or other related entities and/or business partners acting on our behalf to fulfill an award or promotion; conduct surveys; collect payments or to provide a product or service you have requested.

In the course of growing or restructuring our business, we may purchase the assets of another company or sell the assets of our company. During these transactions, information about customers is frequently considered a business asset that is the subject of such a purchase or sale. Also, in the unlikely event that GoCasino.com, or substantially all of its assets are either acquired or subject to liquidation in bankruptcy, Information may be transferred as well.

The security of personal information you may submit in connection with a promotion entry, survey response, online facilities and/or registration for any feature on the Site is of the utmost concern to us, and we strive to ensure its security through encryption on our systems.
