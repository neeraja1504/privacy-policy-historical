Our commitment to you, is to maintain the confidentiality of your identity until you are ready to show them.
While our matching system will allow prospective employers to approach you about opportunities they have available, the system WILL NOT share any personally identifiable information about you until you accept their invitation and apply for the role. You are always totally in control.
Introduction
This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) sets out how MSGooroo Pty Ltd ACN 155 721 145, Gooroo Ventures Limited ACN 613 924 744, and Gooroo.io and its related bodies corporate (“Gooroo”, “we”, “our”, “us”) collects, stores, uses, protects, shares and discloses your Personal Data. Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meanings given in our Terms of Use. This Privacy Policy applies to our Services.

The processing of Personal Data by us will always be in line with the Australian Privacy Principles contained in the Privacy Act 1998 (“Privacy Act”), the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), and in accordance with country-specific data protection regulations applicable to Gooroo.
We have implemented a number of technical and organisational measures to ensure the protection of Personal Data processed through our Services.

By clicking a button indicating that you accept this Privacy Policy, you acknowledge and agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy.
For all areas of the Services where consent is given it is just as easily able to be withdrawn through the appropriate account settings on the Services.
Children
Our Service is not offered to children. We do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children without parental or guardian consent.
If you become aware that a child has provided us with information please contact us. Any information provided that is in breach of this provision will be deleted.
What Personal Data we collect
We will only collect Personal Data from you if it is reasonably necessary for us to collect it in order to provide our Services.
INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE TO US
1.         Account Data
You do not need to create an account with us to use some of our Services.
By creating an account with us, you enter your details on the form provided.
During your account registration, and later on if you update your registration details, you may provide us with your name, email address, password and location. After you create your account we may ask you to provide us with profile data, which is detailed below under the heading Profile Data.
The legal basis for the above processing is based on:
your consent through your voluntary submission of the form/s and agreeing to these terms;
the Personal Data being necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party;
carrying out pre-contractual measures; and/or
any other legitimate interests as detailed below.
The registration of an account and voluntary provision of Personal Data to us is intended to enable us to offer you services that may only be available to registered users, as well as provide with access to password protected areas of the Site.
2.         Profile Data
When you create or update your profile either in your personal profile, a job match profile or your bio you may provide us with information such as:
your skills, including your proficiency and interest in those skills;
what level role you are looking for;
your work preferences, including your availability, work type, residency status and location;
your resume and cover letter;
your work experience and training;
your projects and achievements;
photos of you.
You don’t need to provide us with all of this Personal Data, however doing so will assist you to get more out of our Services, including helping you match with employers and best fit positions. Some of the above information will be selectable whereas others will require you to input that information to us. Data that is used in the above profiles will often be connected. For example, if you provide us with your skills and proficiency in your personal profile, we will then use this data in your job match profile.
The content we collect in your match profile that you create is used independently by Gooroo’s algorithm and recommendations engine to (a) produce matches for employers and (b) give you a list of jobs, that match your skills and other criteria.
The initial match we provide to employers is anonymous in that we do not provide email or other contact information which may identify you.
The list of jobs that we match will be accessible to you to browse and select in your match profile.
The matching system uses a deep learning model and leverages a neural network of the job market that we have built. The system takes into account your stated skills, desires/passions and experience, and using the neural network and learning knowledge-base, creates a compatibility match. The system continues to build a history of you and over time learns, getting more accurate and reliable to the opportunities of most interest to you.  We use this Personal Data in order to optimize our Services, products and features for you including the use of previous searches, browsing history and answers to any other screener questions, to identify you and determine relevant search results and provide you with a match to jobs that you may be interested in.
We will also use information collected in your match profile to suggest to you courses that will support you. We do this to provide you with personalised training recommendations to assist you in finding a job. We will advise you on the skills you should learn to advance your career, and the salary you could possibly demand as a result.
Content that we collect on your bio page is used to be able to create a public profile and any content which you share on your bio will be made public at your choice. We do not collect any sensitive information from you (as that term is defined in the APPs and GDPR), and ask that you do not post any.
We will also use your Personal Data we gather from your profiles to display news and articles about your skills in your dashboard. We do this to provide a customised service to you with information we believe will assist you in your job search.
We have also developed a career pathway tool that will analyse your Personal Data we have collected on your profiles. We collect the information that you give to this tool, in addition to any profile information. We use this information to assist you in finding the career that is right for you.
If you choose to make your profile public any information that you have chosen to display on your profile will be shared to other users.
The legal basis for this processing is based on:
your consent through your voluntary submission of the form/s and agreeing to these terms;
the Personal Data being necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party;
carrying out pre-contractual measures; and/or
any other legitimate interests as detailed below.
3.         Job Application Data
As detailed above, our Services produce matches for jobs with candidates based on their Personal Data. The initial match we produce will be anonymous, meaning that the employer will not be able to personally identify your profile details that are matched. You may then permit the invitation and apply for a specific role. You may also apply for a specific role using the job match page to view a list of jobs that you match with.
Making an application for a job on our Services requires you to complete some mandatory fields such as your name, phone number and email so that the employer is able to contact you.
When you apply for a job and if you have a profile already created, we will use some information automatically from your profile to respond to the application. You will also have the option to provide us with your resume and cover letter. The job application form may comprise of a number of different surveys or questionnaires or forms where you may input your own content or upload content. We use this content and attachments to be able to provide your application to employers to enable the employer and you the opportunity to possibly work together.
After further consideration, your application, including all the content that you have provided, as well as your cover letter and resume may be forwarded to the employer or its nominated representative.
Any questions or queries that you make on the Gooroo platform will also be forwarded to the employer.
You may save jobs which we will collect and display on your dashboard.
The legal basis for this processing is based on:
your consent through your voluntary submission of the form/s and agreeing to these terms;

carrying out pre-contractual measures; and/or
any other legitimate interests as detailed below.

We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and encryption technology that works with Microsoft Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, and Google Chrome browsers, with the objective that only we can read your Personal Data.
We encourage you to be vigilant about the protection of your own information when using digital services, such as social media.

Notifiable Data Breaches
We take data breaches very seriously. Depending on where you reside our policy is:
1.         If you reside in Australia:
In the event that there is a data breach and we are required to comply with the notification of eligible data breaches provisions in Part IIIC of the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) or any other subsequent sections or legislation which supersede this Part IIIC, we will take all reasonable steps to contain the suspected or known breach where possible and follow the following process set out in this clause.
We will take immediate steps to limit any further access or distribution where possible. If we have reasonable grounds to suspect that the data breach is likely to result in serious harm to any individuals involved, then we will take all reasonable steps to ensure an assessment is completed within 30 days of the breach or sooner if possible. We will follow the guide published by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (if any) in making this assessment.
If we reasonably determine that the data breach is not likely to result in serious harm to any individuals involved or any remedial action we take is successful in making serious harm no longer likely, then no notification or statement will be made.
Where, following an assessment and undertaking remedial action (if any), we still have reasonable grounds to believe serious harm is likely, as soon as practicable, we will provide a statement to each of the individuals whose data was breached or who are at risk. The statement will contain details of the breach and recommendations of the steps each individual should take. We will also provide a copy of the statement to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner.
2.         If you reside in the European Union of EFTA States:
We will endeavour to meet the 72 hour deadline as imposed by the GDPR, to report any data breach to the supervisory authority where a data breach occurs that will likely be a risk to you.
Further, where there is likely to be a high risk to your rights we will endeavour to contact you without undue delay.
We will review every incident and take action to prevent future breaches.
