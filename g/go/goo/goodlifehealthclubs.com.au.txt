11. SECURITY MEASURES TO PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
Goodlife takes reasonable steps to maintain the security of your personal information and to prevent the misuse, interference, loss, modification and unauthorised access to or disclosure of your personal information.
We have implemented a variety of electronic and physical security measures to safeguard the privacy of your personal information. These measures include:
your information is stored on secured networks consistent with industry standards, and is only accessible by those employees and agents who have special access rights to such systems;
our websites use a secure server so that credit card details provided when purchasing tickets or paying for memberships, for example, are transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology;
industry-standard encryption technologies are used when transferring or receiving sensitive information supplied by users;
where your information is in hardcopy form, such documents are stored in secured areas only accessible by those employees and agents with special access rights;
our Eftpos terminals for credit card transactions at the retail outlets are PCI Compliant to provide necessary security over credit card data;
our IT networks undergo necessary penetration testing to continually identify and remediate potential opportunities for unauthorised data access; and
periodic data recon is carried out on our point of sale systems to ensure no credit card details are stored without encryption.
We also ensure where possible that our contractors, agents, commercial partners and third party service providers have the same information security measures in place. While we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee or warrant its complete security. No data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. If you have an online account with one of our businesses, your account will be able to be accessed by anyone who knows your login details. You should keep you login details, and any other information you use to remember these details, private and secure.
We will not be responsible for any loss or harm that you may suffer as a result of a leak of your personal information unless we have breached this Privacy Policy or the Australian privacy laws.
