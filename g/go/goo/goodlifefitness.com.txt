Privacy Policy | GoodLife Fitness
GoodLife Fitness – Privacy Policy
At GoodLife Fitness we are privileged each and every day to help members to achieve their health and fitness goals. We understand the need to protect personal information provided to us and take this role very seriously. Our commitment to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of our members’ personal information is addressed in this privacy policy.
We want you to understand why we collect your personal information, how the confidentiality of this information is protected and how you can find out what information concerning you is recorded. This policy applies to all GoodLife Fitness clubs across Canada.
Accountability
GoodLife Fitness is responsible for your personal information under its control. We have appointed a Chief Privacy Officer who is accountable for our compliance with this Privacy Policy. Please refer to the last page of this policy for information on how to contact our Chief Privacy Officer.
Personal Information
Personal information is information about you as an individual, and includes information that identifies you and that can be used to contact you. This includes such information as your name, birth date, e-mail address, mailing address, telephone number, banking information, credit card number, and the like. It may also include information about your health and fitness levels and goals, if you have communicated these to us. We also collect data about the services that you purchase from us, the frequency of your visits to our clubs and about the specific equipment, classes and services that you take advantage of, so that we may constantly strive to offer you the best range of fitness options. If you have a Corporate Membership, we will collect the name of the business that you work for or have a membership with.
Aggregate Data
We may also combine your personal information with that of other individuals to create aggregate data which we will use, for example, to improve our products and services and develop new ones. Aggregate data is general information about groups of customers but not about you as an individual. We may also disclose aggregate member data to be used in academic research (e.g., exercise adherence), provided, however, your data will never be individually identified or identifiable in reports of the research findings; only aggregated data (group averages) will be presented.
Photographs
In the interest of security and prevention of crime, we may take a digital photograph of you when you become a member. We will use that photograph to verify your identify when you attend at the club. If you don’t wish to provide your photograph, you may decline, and you may ask us to delete your photograph at a later date. If we do not have your photograph on your member profile, we may ask you to provide identification to verify your identity when you attend our clubs. Your photograph will be deleted when your membership is terminated in our systems.
Contacting Us
GoodLife Fitness wants to hear from our members regarding any issues or comments they may have with respect to their memberships or any services offered by our clubs. We may record this information and transmit it to our clubs in order to address them in the appropriate manner. When you contact us, by post, telephone, fax, email, SMS, live chat, through our website or through social media, we collect the information that you disclose to us. This may include details such as your name, address, telephone, fax, email and phone number, as well as your questions, inquiries, comments, complaints or requests. If you correspond with us though any media, we may keep a record of that correspondence.
Surveys
From time to time, we may ask you to complete surveys that we use for research purposes and which we will use, for example, to improve our products and services and develop new ones. We will collect the information that you provide if you respond, however you are under no obligation to respond to them.
Video Surveillance
We use video surveillance in our clubs to protect the rights, property and safety of GoodLife, our employees, members and others.

Third Party Disclosure
GoodLife Fitness is not in the business of selling member information to others. We do contract with trusted companies to act on our behalf to fulfill certain functions. We may use third party service providers to process or handle personal information on our behalf and to assist us with various services such as data processing, printing, mail distribution, content, advertising, data analytics, and marketing. Some of our service providers are located outside of Canada. As a result, your personal information may be accessible to regulatory authorities in accordance with the law of these jurisdictions. We will take steps to ensure that such parties adhere to our policy with respect to the protection of your personal information.

Digital Markers (including cookies)
A digital marker is a resource created by the visitors’ browser in order to remember certain pieces of information for the Web server to reference during the same or subsequent visit to the Web site. Examples of digital markers are “cookies” or HTML5 Web storage. Some examples of what digital markers do are as follows:
they allow a Web site to recognize a previous visit each time the visitor accesses the site;
they track what information is viewed on a site which helps Web site administrators ensure visitors find what they are looking for.
GoodLife Fitness uses sessional and persistent digital markers on some portions of its Web site. This allows us to improve the quality of our service, including for storing user preferences, tracking user trends and providing relevant advertising to you based on your activities on our Website and others’ websites. During your on-line visit, your browser exchanges data with GoodLife Fitness’ Web server. The digital markers used do not allow GoodLife Fitness to identify individuals. You may adjust your browser settings to reject digital markers, including cookies, if you so choose. However, it may affect your ability to interact with GoodLife Fitness’ Web site.
