Privacy Policy
This privacy policy forms part of our web usage terms & condition. If you do not agree with any term of this privacy policy, you must cease use of Go2Africa's websites immediately. You can also contact us if you would like further insight into how we collect, use and secure the data acquired through our websites.
Welcome to Go2Africa’s Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy ("policy") sets out the basis on which Go2Africa collects, uses and shares the data that we receive from users of our websites and online applications. We take the privacy of our users seriously, and we recommend that you read this policy carefully. By using Go2Africa's website at www.go2africa.com, associated websites, landing pages and applications, or our Plan My Trip tool ("websites"), you agree to be bound by this policy.
Our travellers are from many different countries - in recognition of this, we endeavour to process all data in accordance with principles of internationally accepted best practice, and compliance regulations. We regularly review our compliance with this policy and whenever we receive a formal complaint, we will contact the person who made the complaint to attempt to resolve his or her concerns.
Please note that by using our websites (as a user browsing the websites), you are consenting to our collection and use of your information as more fully set out in this policy. If you have any concerns about the use of your information, or the contents of this policy, please feel free to contact us.
Data collected
We distinguish in this policy between ‘personal data’ (data that is required to facilitate international travel), and 'non-personal data' (data regarding usage of the websites, and de-identified information extracted from the websites for analysis). We collect both personal and non-personal data through our websites and through third parties, either automatically, or by your providing this information to us during enquiring, signing up for our newsletter, or during the consultation phase to help us improve the info we will be providing you with.
User Notifications:
Failure to provide requested information may impair our ability to provide professional advice when curating and sharing proposed travel itineraries.
You will need to ensure that your personal information submitted to us is accurate and up-to-date.
You are responsible for any third party information obtained, published or shared through the websites, and you consent to only use or share this third party data with the third party's consent.
Personal Data:
We collect and store the personal information that you may provide to us through our websites when you enquire with us, update or change your information with us, or make use of our services.
We also collect and store information in relation to your travel itinerary, travel preferences and particulars of those traveling with you, for example through communications, surveys and other data submitted by you.
Anyone involved with the processing, transmission, or storage of card data must comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS). Stripe has been audited by an independent PCI Qualified Security Assessor (QSA) and is certified as a PCI Level 1 Service Provider. This is the most stringent level of certification available in the payments industry. Go2Africa does not collect or store any credit card or account details.

In addition to personal data, we also store non-personal data, which cannot be used to identify our users. The kinds of non-personal data that we collect includes de-identified data about usage of our websites.
We also make use of cookies or similar tracking tools to identify website users and remember their preferences, for the purpose of providing a better user experience and service, and marketing/advertising our services online.

Information Security
Methods of processing
We undertake to process your personal data in a reasonable manner and take appropriate, reasonable security measures to prevent unauthorised access, disclosure, modification, or unauthorised destruction of your personal data. All data processing shall be carried out by employees, consultants or third party service providers using computers and/or IT enabled tools, following standard organizational procedures and modes.
In some cases, personal and non-personal data may be accessible to certain types of persons involved with the operation of the websites (administration, sales, marketing, finance, legal, system administration) or external parties (such as third party technical service providers, mail carriers, hosting providers, IT companies, communications agencies to name a few) appointed, if necessary, by us as data processors.
Place
All data collected through our websites is managed and processed primarily at our various operating offices, and in any other place where the parties involved with the processing are located. For further information on our servers and places where we process data, please contact us.
Due to the fact that we have travellers from all over the world, and hosting services have become more 'cloud-based' and international in recent years, we may send and store your personal data outside of the country in which you reside, and there will therefore be some cross-border transfer of this personal data. We are nevertheless committed to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of personal information when it is transferred, in accordance with this Policy and the data privacy requirements in the EU.
