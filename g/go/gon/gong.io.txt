When you contact us we may receive and process any personal information that you provide us.
Customers’ Use of our Service
We provide speech analytics services.

The recordings and our analysis of the recordings may contain personal information.

We may use Customer’s email address to contact Customer when necessary, to send Customer reminders and to provide Customer information and notices about the Service. We may include commercial and marketing information.
We obey the law and expect you to do the same. If necessary, we may use your identifiable information to enforce our terms, policies and legal agreements, to comply with court orders and warrants, and assist law enforcement agencies, to collect debts, prevent fraud, misappropriation, infringements, identity thefts and any other misuse of the Service, and to take any action in any legal dispute and proceeding.
We commit to process personal information solely for the purposes described in this policy. To the extent relevant and possible, we will make efforts to maintain the information accurate, complete and up-to-date.
Sharing Identifiable Information with Others
We provide our Customers with data analytics of calls and online demos that their personnel have conducted with clients and prospects. Customers are further provided access to the recordings for a limited period of time and they may share the access to the recordings internally and with relevant third parties.
We do not sell, rent or lease your personally identifiable information. We may share your identifiable information with service providers and other third parties, if necessary to fulfill the purposes for collecting the information, provided that any such third party will commit to protect your privacy as required under the applicable law and this policy.
We may also share personally identifiable information with companies or organizations connected, or affiliated with us, such as subsidiaries, sister-companies and parent companies, with the express provision that their use of such information must comply with this policy.
Additionally, a merger, acquisition or any other structural change may require us to transfer your personal information to another entity, provided that the receiving entity will comply with this policy.
We may be liable for onward transfers to third parties in violation of the Privacy Shield Principles. For further information, please below see the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield chapter of this policy.
