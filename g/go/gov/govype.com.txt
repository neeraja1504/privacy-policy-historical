Privacy Policy | Vype UK
This Privacy Policy (together with the Terms and Conditions, Conditions of Sale, Cookie Policy and any other documents we refer to in this policy or those Terms) explains how we, Nicoventures Trading Limited, may collect, use and share your personal information when visiting https://www.govype.com/uk (‘Website’).
We are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy.  Please read the following carefully.
By visiting and using the Website you are agreeing to the use of your personal information in the way that is described in this Privacy Policy.
Please refer to our Cookie Policy below if you would like detailed information on the types of cookies we use on the Website, the purposes for which we use each cookie, how you can disable and enable the use of certain cookies and the consequences of doing so.

How to contact us
What information do we collect about you
We collect and process the following data about you (‘your information’):
information that you submit online via the Website;
any correspondence you send to us;
details of your visits to the Website and the resources that you access (which may include, amongst other things, traffic data and communication data); and
details of transactions you carry out or orders you place through the Website.
We are aware that your information may be confidential and we will protect the confidentiality of your information in accordance with our normal procedures and legal requirements.
We also automatically collect information about how visitors use our Website by using cookies and similar technology. To learn more about how we use cookies please see our Cookie Policy.
Verifying your age
As this Website relates to vaping and vaping products, we must make sure that users paying by debit card only are verified on the Website and are aged 18 years or over. Failing age verification will mean you cannot complete a purchase.
In order to enable us to do this we will require certain information about you. This will then be passed to our service provider (GB Group plc) who will check it against public sources of information to deliver confirmation, usually in real time.
In order to verify your identity, we may also require you to provide demographic information (such as gender and birth date) and additional personally identifiable information which may be used by GB Group Plc to verify your details and may include;
Passport number; or
Driving licence number.
This information is checked against secure independent data sources, such as the electoral roll, in order to help verify identity.
The verification process may include disclosing your information to third party data providers including credit reference agencies. The data providers may check the details supplied against any particulars on any database (public or otherwise) to which they have access.
Any verification check with a credit reference agency will be registered as an ‘unrecorded enquiry’ on your credit report. An unrecorded enquiry means that the search was not made for lending purposes and it is only included on your credit report so that you know the search was made. It is not visible to lenders so it does not affect your credit rating or score when you apply for credit. As part of this process, we will not receive any additional information from the credit reference agency about you.
In some cases, we may need to ask for further information in order to verify your age. If this is necessary, we will contact you to explain why.
What we do with information we collect about you
Use of information
We use your information in the following ways:
to ensure that the Website’s content is presented as effectively as possible for you;
for our internal purposes, such as quality control, Website performance, system administration and to evaluate use of the Website, so that we can provide you with enhanced services;
to notify you about changes to our services;
to provide you with information, products or services that you request from us, or which we feel may interest you (provided of course that you agree);
to create reports to assist with future marketing;
to verify your age (see the section above for further details);
to carry out our obligations arising from any contracts with you and for billing and delivery purposes; and
to enable you to participate in the features of the Website, when you choose to do so.
We may monitor your use of the Website and record your email address and/or IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers.  This is statistical information about our users’ browsing actions and patterns and does not identify any individual.
We collect non-personal aggregated statistics data about visitors to the Website and sales and traffic patterns. Just to be clear, this information does not identify users in any personal capacity and we do not use this information to build profiles on individual users: it just contains generalised information about the users of the Website.
We only keep your information for as long as is necessary.
Marketing
If you are an existing customer or you have made a sales enquiry, we may contact you by email / telephone / post with information about products and services which are similar to those we previously provided to you, unless you have indicated that you do not want to hear from us.
Otherwise, we may contact you by email / telephone / post only if you consent.
We may also pass your information to other organisations (if you consent) who may contact you to provide marketing information about their products and services by email / telephone / post.
If you do not want us to use your information in this way, please tick the relevant boxes during the order process when we collect your information.  You may ask us at any time not to use your information for marketing purposes by contacting us at info@govype.com .
