Information Collection and Use
We collect the following personally identifiable information about our users: name, email address, telephone number, business address, shipping address, social security number, preferred means of communication, credit card information and other information voluntarily provided. This personally identifiable information is typically provided when users register for online services, purchase products online, or participate in contests, surveys or sweepstakes. We also collect information about users regarding web pages accessed, traffic patterns and site usage.
We, our service providers and our vendors may use any information collected by users: to operate the Service; to effect users' transactions; to provide better services, products and opportunities to users; to notify users about services, products and opportunities that may be of interest to such users; to create and share reports about users' transactions; and for other marketing purposes. We may also trade, sell, rent or otherwise share your personally identifiable information with other third parties, including our business partners.
Cookies
Cookies are pieces of information stored on your hard drive containing information about you. These pieces of information allow the Service to remember important information that will make your use of the Service more useful. GoingOn uses cookies for a variety of purposes. For instance, we use cookies to allow your automated login and to track your preferences and usage. You can choose to reject or turn off the cookies through your browser settings. If you reject or turn off the cookies, you may still use the Service. The only drawback to this is that you will be limited in some areas of the Service. For example, you will not be able to participate in any of our sweepstakes, contests or monthly drawings that we may offer.
Log Files
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the Service, track users' movements, and gather demographic information.
Security
We use security measures, such as firewalls and Security Socket Layers ("SSL"), to safeguard the confidentiality of our users' personally identifiable information. Information we collect about our users is stored on secured servers. However, "perfect security" does not exist. If you have any questions about the security of the Service, please send an e-mail to privacy@GoingOn.com.

Disclosure Required by Law
We cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use the Service for illegal activities. Therefore, we respond to subpoenas, warrants or other court orders regarding information concerning any users. We will, at our discretion, disclose information if we believe that we are required to do so by law, that such disclosure is necessary to protect us from legal liability or that we should do so to protect the integrity of the Service.
