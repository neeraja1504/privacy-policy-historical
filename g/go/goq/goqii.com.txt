Welcome to GOQii Life
Our Policy
We, GOQii (collectively used to refer to GOQii Inc., GOQii Technologies Pvt. Ltd. and its affiliates, successors and assigns) bring to you a digital health and fitness subscription service that combines one-on-one mobile personal coaching and fitness tracking technology to help you shift to a healthier lifestyle and reach your goals. While fitness trackers and apps are useful tools, they are missing the elements of on-going engagement, motivation and accountability. GOQii solves this by connecting your activity tracker or smart watch to a professional health and fitness coach of your choice via the “GOQii App” (available on iOS and Android) and a wearable GOQii fitness band (" GOQii Tracker "). You can read more about GOQii and our product at website goqii.com (together with the GOQii App is hereby referred to as the " Platform "). For ease of reading and clarity, the Platform, the GOQii App and the GOQii Tracker are collectively referred to as the " Services ". Your use of the Platform and Services are governed by the Terms of Use and other policies of GOQii.
We know that the privacy of your personal data is very important to you. This Privacy Policy sets forth GOQii’s policy with respect to information including personally identifiable data (" Personal Data ") and other information that is collected from Platform visitors and users.

Non-Identifiable Data
When you interact with GOQii through the Platform, we receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information. Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you. Consequently, we do not adjust or alter our Platform’s automatic tracking and data collection in response to a Do Not Track signal or request. GOQii may store such non-identifiable information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by GOQii affiliates, agents or service providers. This Platform may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Platform, the number of visitors to each page of our Platform, and the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers. It is important to note that no Personal Data is available or used in this process.
In operating this Platform, we may use a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Platform gives to your browser when you access the Platform. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Platform and help us analyze Platform usage more accurately. For instance, our Platform may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Platform without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Platform. In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data except with your permission. On most web browsers, you will find a “help” section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Platform’s features.
his Platform may enable the use of the Adobe Flash Player. Adobe’s Flash Player is used by the vast majority of websites that offer video and other interactive content. By default, your use of the Adobe Flash Player generates “flash cookies” (also known as “persistent identification elements” or “local shared objects”). The Adobe Flash Player (and similar applications) use flash cookies to remember user settings, preferences and usage similar to the browser cookies referenced above. You can disable, delete and control the degree to which you accept flash cookies by accessing your Adobe Flash Player management tools directly through the settings manager for Adobe Flash, located here. If you do not allow flash cookies to take any disc space on your computer, you may not be able to take advantage of or participate in certain features on this Platform.
