This privacy policy is designed to inform users of the Gobza website (www.gobza.com), mobile applications, microsites, software and service (collectively, the “Service”) about how Tops Global, Inc., doing business as Gobza (“Gobza”, “we” or “us”), gathers and uses personal information collected by us in connection with use of the Service. Gobza will take reasonable steps to protect user privacy consistent with the guidelines set forth in this policy and with applicable U.S. laws. In this policy, “user” or “you” means any person using the Service, whether by browsing the Gobza website or mobile apps, purchasing a Gobza promotional voucher (“Vouchers”) that may be exchanged for goods and services offered by Gobza merchants (each a “Merchant”), uploading or exchanging a Voucher, or participating in any other activities available through the Service.

IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, DO NOT USE THE SERVICE.
First Up, We Want You to Know This
