You can make a booking for any of our Go Ape adventures on our website, by contacting our call centre, or when you arrive at a Go Ape site. Before you can take part in your Go Ape adventure, you will need to sign a disclaimer, possibly more than one if you have additional support needs. Sometimes we may ask your permission to take photos and video footage of you experiencing your Go Ape adventure for use in our marketing. If you are involved in an accident or incident we have a process that we need you to follow, which will include the potential collection of additional information.

The following is generally required as minimum: name, email address, phone number, postal address, and payment card details or information relating to your company for group bookings. If you have any additional needs, you may need to provide more information.
Why and how do we use it?
The information we request from you is required to finalise your booking including taking your payment, and to ensure we can provide your activity. If you require additional physical assistance to access and enjoy the activities we offer, the extra information you give to us will help. It also helps us to comply under equality legislation.

AGREE TO HAVE YOUR PHOTO TAKEN AND USED
What information do we collect?
If you give your consent to having photos or video taken we will ask for the following information: name, email address, mobile number, signature and whether you are under 16 or not. For children under 16, we will collect these details for the parent/guardian of each child, plus the name of the child(ren).

We may use these images across our full range of marketing and media channels and applications which promote and publicise Go Ape. This may include digital and print content and materials such as our website, blog, social media, posters, advertisements, email content, leaflets and other publicity materials.
Footage will not be used in conjunction with any other information that could identify you, unless we have gained your express permission beforehand. Such instances could include for a press article which may name you, or as a competition winner on a social media channel.
Where do we look after it?
We keep all footage that we are actively using on servers operated by our hosting provider. Once we stop using the photos and video, we will destroy most of it but will keep selected footage that we used as a historical archive on the same servers.
Who do we share it with?
We will not sell the images but may share them with third parties, as may be needed in the production and dissemination of our marketing materials, such as designers, printers, advertisers, journalists, third party re-sellers. We may also share them with other companies and organisations with whom we engage in joint promotional activities, such as suppliers of other leisure services or products. Images used on our social media channels may also be shared by our active followers. Although we have clear terms of use of materials set out in our Website Terms of Use Policy it is possible that other third parties will take and use images on our website or other digital channels without our permission – that’s just the nature of the web.
How long do we keep it for?
Go Ape has a policy to actively use images for up to 10 years. Again, due to the nature of the web, some images may remain ‘out there’ for longer. We may also keep images that have been used in marketing activity in our archive library as a historic record of our brand and promotional development and these may remain indefinitely.
