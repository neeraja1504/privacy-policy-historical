GoAntiques
GoAntiques Privacy Policy
GoAntiques.com is owned and operated by Gemr, Inc. (" GoAntiques ," " we ," " us " or " our(s) "). We are committed to protecting your privacy. We have prepared this Privacy Policy to describe to you our practices regarding the Personal Information (as defined below) we collect from users (" User(s)," " you ," " your(s)") of the GoAntiques website, mobile application(s) and other related services (each individually or together, the "Site").
By using our Site, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and all other GoAntiques policies governing the use of the Site and you expressly consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. By using the Site you represent that you have read and understand this Privacy Policy and other GoAntiques policies and agree to be bound by the terms therein.
Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meanings given in our Terms of Use.
For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, "Personal Information" is any personally identifiable information about an individual person such as a person's name, physical address, email address and telephone number, and may include financial and other information provided by an individual who accesses our Site and/or uses our services.
TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT
Though you may access and use portions of our Site without providing any Personal Information, in order to take advantage of the full capabilities of the Site and to obtain access to, and use of, many of the features of our Site, you must provide certain Personal Information. For example, in order to register for a membership account through the Site (each a "Membership Account"), to sell items on the Site and to request information about products and services offered on our Site you must provide certain Personal Information.
Personal Information Provided Voluntarily by the User. When you register for a Membership Account you will be asked to provide Personal Information. You may also be asked to provide Personal Information when you participate in various services and offerings available through our Site, when you contact us via phone, mail, or otherwise, and when you participate in our sweepstakes, contests, surveys and related promotions. The Personal Information we may collect and store includes, but is not limited to, the following categories of information:
● your name, mailing address, email address, telephone number, year of birth, and gender, information concerning your hobbies, interests and occupation, and financial information (for billing purposes); and community discussions, chats and correspondence.
Anonymous Data. When you use our Site we may collect data that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Information (" Anonymous Data "). Anonymous Data does not, by itself, permit the identification of individual persons.
Information Collected from Other Sources. We may obtain information about you from other sources, such as companies that update and verify email and physical addresses, for the purpose of updating and enhancing our files.
User Communities on our Site. Our Site includes community areas (e.g., forums, bulletin boards and chat rooms) in which you may participate after establishing a Membership Account. Although your participation in these communities is governed by this privacy policy, there are certain important characteristics of these communities that you should always keep in mind. **** We use Membership Account registration information and other information users provide as they interact within the communities to:
● authenticate users; provide communications from us to users regarding the community; and administer the community (including, but not limited to, managing the technical requirements of the site and monitoring submissions and posts for offensive content after posting and removing such content in our sole discretion). ****
Please note that information (including your name, email address, address, or phone number) you provide in a posting on community or any bulletin board is available (even after you stop participating in the community) to any other individual who has access to that same community and may be used by another individual in a manner unintended by you, including as a target for unsolicited communications. You should therefore treat any information provided by you in the content of a submission or post to a community as public information. For this reason, we urge you to act cautiously in providing any such information in your submissions or posts, as we are not liable for any use or misuse by an individual user of the information you provide in a submission or post. Upon termination of a community, Personal Information we collected through the community will continue to be treated in accordance with this privacy policy.
USE OF YOUR INFORMATION
