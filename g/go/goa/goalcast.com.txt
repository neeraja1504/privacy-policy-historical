Goalcast Inc. (“ Goalcast ” or “ we ”) places particular importance on the protection of your Personal Information. That is why we are committed to ensure the accuracy, security and confidentiality of the Personal Information collected about you, in accordance with applicable laws.
This Privacy Policy (the “ Policy ”) defines how Goalcast collects, uses, discloses and retains your Personal Information and is intended to help you understand our practices. By providing us with Personal Information, you consent to its processing in accordance with this Policy.

Therefore, you may contact Anouare Abdou, Director of Operations at the following email address: Anouare (at) Goalcast (dot) com.

Sadly, not everybody is well-intentioned, and we cannot guaranty we will not get hacked.

Before we consider any request, we must make sure that you are who you say you are. No request for access, rectification or deletion may be considered unless it is made in writing by you when you prove that you are the individual concerned (or the representative, heir or successor of that individual, or the liquidator of the succession, a beneficiary of life insurance or of a death benefit).
We will address your request fast. When we receive a request for access, rectification or removal, we will attempt to respond within a reasonable timeframe after receipt of the request.
