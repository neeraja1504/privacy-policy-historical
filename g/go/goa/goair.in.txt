Privacy Policy - GoAir
We respect the privacy of our users. This privacy statement is designed to help them understand the type of information we gather and what we do with the gathered information.
The collected information falls into two categories:
Information voluntarily supplied by the visitors to our website through optional registration
Tracking information gathered as visitors navigate through our website
To make use of certain features of our website (such as e-mail and other interactive forums), visitors need to register and provide certain information as a part of the registration process. We may ask for their name and address, the name and address of their company affiliation, their home and business phone numbers, their e-mail address, certain financial information, and any other information which may be useful. This helps us tailor our website to suit our visitor’s needs.
To make our website responsive to the needs and interests of our visitors, we track the pages visited by each user. Then, we aggregate this data with the data on the pages visited by other users, to track the overall visitor traffic pattern.
Our web servers automatically collect some information about our visitors when they request pages, including their IP address. The IP address is the number that is used by the computers connected to the Internet to identify the visitor’s computer so that data (such as the web pages they request) can be sent to them. The visitor’s IP address does not identify them personally. We use our visitor’s IP address, among the other things, to diagnose problems with our web servers, and to manage our website. We may also use cookies to meet the needs of our visitors. They can set their browser not to accept cookies, but if that is done; our visitors may not be able to take advantage of certain personalised features on our website.
We recognise industry standards and employ security safeguards to protect personal information of our visitors from unauthorised access and misuse. Our online reservation system resides on a secure server that encrypts all purchase information using Secure Socket Layers. We use all reasonable endeavours to protect personal information from loss, misuse, and alteration. Only our authorised employees that are under appropriate confidentiality obligations have access to users' personal information.
Our visitors should, however, understand that the open nature of the internet is such that data may flow over networks without security measures and may be accessed and used by people other than those for whom the data is intended.
Please note that we respect the privacy of our users. We will not sell or provide any of their personal information to any third party except as necessary to provide requisite service(s), carry out the transaction(s) they have requested, to operate the GoAir website and/or if we believe in good faith that the law requires it.
Our website often provides links to third party websites, such as those of our business partners and online advertisers. We request our visitors to review their privacy policies to learn more about what, why, and how they collect and use information of their visitors/users.
A final note: The web is an evolving medium. We may need to change our privacy policy from time to time. By continuing to use the services after we post such changes, our visitors accept the terms of this policy, as modified.
