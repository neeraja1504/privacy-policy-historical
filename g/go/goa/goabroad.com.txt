Each program directory also features verification levels, real participant reviews of programs, and past participant interviews to help travelers understand what the program experience is like on a deeper level.
We also provide resource directories and information on scholarships abroad, embassies, study abroad loans, and travel insurance, as well as an extensive article directory.
In addition to our program and resource directories, we also offer free tools to help travelers choose an international program: MyGoAbroad and the GoAbroad Online Advisors. MyGoAbroad is a personalized dashboard whereby you can bookmark and compare programs side-by-side, save articles and resources, and organize your travel plans.
