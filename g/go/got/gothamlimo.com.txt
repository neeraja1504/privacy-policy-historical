Gotham Limousine Service
Gotham Limousine has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices.
This privacy statement is applicable to the website: gothamlimo.com
We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. IP addresses are logged to track a user's session. This gives Gotham Limousine an idea of which parts of our site users are visiting. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a users session will be tracked, but the user will be anonymous.
This site contains links to other sites. Gotham Limousine is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.
Our site uses an order form for customers to request information, products, and services. We collect visitor's contact information (like their email address), financial information (like their account or credit card numbers), and reservation specifications (like dates, times, and addresses for service, airline information, and passenger names). Customer financial data is used to validate clients financial ability to pay for services requested and ultimately for guarantee and collection of payment for such service. Contact information from the order form may be used to send information about our company to our customers. The customer's contact information may also be used to get in touch with the visitor when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. Financial information that is collected is used to bill the user for products and services. This site does not sell visitor contact or financial information to any third party.
Visitors are given the opportunity to complete an online guestbook form via our "testimonials" link to submit general feedback about our services. The form will ask for information (like their name, company, e-mail address, web site URL, city, state, country, and comments). All information the visitor supplies in the form becomes a record in our guestbook database which is published and made publicly viewable on our site via the same "testimonials" link. Any personal information entered into this guestbook by the visitor is not used by us for any purpose. The visitor will never receive any communication from us as a result of a submission to our guestbook database. This site reserves the right to delete any guestbook record for any reason.
Visitors may be given the opportunity to participate in on-line surveys. These surveys are used to build a profile of visitors to our site and learn what visitors think about our site. The surveys may ask general personal questions about the visitor (like their age, income level, education), general questions about where the visitor lives (like the country, city, state, or province), questions pertaining to what the visitor likes or does not like about our site, and comment areas in which the visitor can provide suggestions to improve our site. The survey form may give the visitor the option of providing their e-mail address. This contact information may be used by us to get in touch with the visitor regarding their submission. This site does not sell visitor contact information to any third party.
