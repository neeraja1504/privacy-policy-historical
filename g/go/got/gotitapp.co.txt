The laws of the U.S. and other countries governing data collection and use may not be as comprehensive or protective as the laws of the country where you live.
Our Use of Your Information
We use information that you provide or that we otherwise collect in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. Notably, we will use your information to link you with the best match of Expert (if you are a Student) or Student (if you are an Expert). In addition, if you are an Expert we may use your information to audit your work, build Expert rankings and facilitate payment to you; if you are a Student we may use your information to notify you of communications from Experts and other Students as well as invites from friends and to collect payment from you.
If you provide information for a certain reason, we may use that information in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by email, we will use the information you provide including your email address, to answer your question or resolve your problem. Also, if you provide information in order to obtain access to the Services, we will use your information to provide you with access to such services and to monitor your use of such services. The Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates (the “Related Companies”) may also use your information collected through the Services to help us improve the content and functionality of the Services, to better understand our users and to improve the Services. The Company and its affiliates may use this information to contact you in the future to tell you about services we believe will be of interest to you. If we do so, each marketing communication we send you will contain instructions permitting you to “opt-out” of receiving future marketing communications. In addition, if at any time you wish not to receive any future marketing communications or you wish to have your name deleted from our mailing lists, please contact us as indicated below.
Our Disclosure of Your Information
The Company is not in the business of selling your information. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your information with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below:
Business Transfers: As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, your information may be part of the transferred assets.

For example, we currently use Amazon Web Services and other data storage providers to store data related to and used in connection with the Service, which includes your information. In addition, we use Apple, Braintree/PayPal and other third party payment processors in connection with the Service. We also use Asana to enable communication among our team members. When we employ another entity to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function.
