Identity Theft / Fraudulent Activities
Identity Theft/Fraud
Identity Theft occurs when someone uses sensitive information, called Personally Identifiable Information (or PII) of another person without their permission to commit fraud or other crimes, such as Account Takeover or Application Fraud. [Account Takeover has occurred when an individual acquires another person's existing credit account information and purchases products and services at the victim's expense. Application Fraud has occurred when an individual uses another's Social Security Number or other Personally Identifiable Information to open new credit accounts in the victim's name.]
If you believe you are a victim of Identity Theft, contact the three major credit bureaus to place a fraud alert message on your credit file. When you place a fraud alert on your file, the credit reporting agencies will send you a copy of your credit report at no charge.
Experian (1-888-397-3742)
Equifax (1-800-525-6285)
TransUnion (1-800-680-7289)
Carefully review your credit reports for: accounts you did not open, inquiries from creditors you did not initiate, and for personal information (such as home address and social security number) that is not accurate. If you see anything you do not understand or any accounts you did not open, call the credit reporting agency at the telephone number on the report.
If you decide not to place a fraud alert on your credit file, you can still obtain free copies of your credit report by going to the following Annual Credit Report website (www.annualcreditreport.com) or by calling them toll-free at 1-877-322-8228. (Hearing impaired consumers can access their TDD service at 1-877-730-4204.
