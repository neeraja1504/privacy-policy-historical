If you opt-out of the use of your Personal Data, you will not be able to use our Services.
WHY WE COLLECT AND USE PERSONAL DATA:
We use your Personal Data with your consent and in furtherance of our legitimate interests, including providing you with any Services you have requested or authorized. The Personal Data we collect from you and others allows you to use our Services, and for you to register for and log into your GotSoccer Account. We collect and use your Personal Data to provide you the best experience with our Services, and so that you or your child may participate on his or her team, club and association.
WHAT PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT AND HOW WE COLLECT IT:
We may collect Personal Data in the following ways:
Information You Provide. Many of our Services require you provide your Personal Data, including to register for a GotSoccer Account. When you register, we may ask for personal information, such as your name, address, email address, telephone number, gender, birth date and other personal information necessary for you to participate on your team, club, state association and national organization. You may also provide us Personal Data when you request our Services or report a problem with our Services.
Information Your Team, Club, State or National Association Gives Us About You. GotSoccer may collect and process Personal Data provided by our clients, which may include your team, club, association, state association, national organization, and other similar organizations (collectively "GotSoccer Clients"). These GotSoccer Clients may provide us information about you, with your consent, so that you may use our Services and participate on your team or club. For example, your team's manager, coach or your club may provide us, with your consent, your player information and other Personal Data to register you for a tournament or a league. Your club may authorize your team manager, team coach or other representatives to access your Personal Data for the purposes of administering your team. If a GotSoccer Client provides any of your Personal Data to us, the GotSoccer Client is responsible for providing any notices and/or obtaining any consents necessary from you for us to access and use the Personal Data. We do not control information collection or use practices of GotSoccer Clients. Please contact your team, club, association, state association, national organization, or other organizations regarding their own privacy policies. Once your Personal Data is provided to us by a GotSoccer Client, you may access and control your Personal Data pursuant to the provisions of this Privacy Policy.

The privacy and data protection laws and rules regarding when government authorities may access data may vary from those in the country in which you live.
Application of Privacy Policy. Our Privacy Policy applies to all the sites, services and applications offered by GotSoccer and its affiliates, but excludes services that have separate privacy policies that do not incorporate this Privacy Policy. For example, clubs (and coaches/administrators authorized by clubs), associations, and state associations may, with your consent, export your Personal Data to comply with obligations from the United States Soccer Federation (USSF), U.S. Youth Soccer (USYS) or other similar organizations.

We are not responsible for the content of privacy practices of such third-party sites.
'Do Not Track' Notifications. Some browsers allow you to automatically notify websites you visit not to track you using a "Do Not Track" signal. There is no consensus among industry participants as to what "Do Not Track" means in this context. Like many websites and online services, we currently do not alter our practices when we receive a "Do Not Track" signal from a visitor's browser.
