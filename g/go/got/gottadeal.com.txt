Our Commitment To Privacy
Your privacy is important to us.  To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.

The Way We Use Information
We use the information you provide about yourself to conduct normal site business only. We do not share this information with outside parties unless explicity stated or agreed to by you.
We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.

We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an affiliate partner that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number visitors clicked on a specific link, or that Z number of visitors are subscribed to our mailing list, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.
