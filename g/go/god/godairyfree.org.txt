Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important to us at GoDairyFree.org and GoDairyFree.com. And for that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under the age of 13 . No part of our website is structured to attract anyone under the age of 13 . Also, if we hear of, are informed of, or are witness to any illegal activity with, to, or directed at children, we will promptly report such parties to the proper authorities for prosecution.
