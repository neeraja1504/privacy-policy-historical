For residents of California and Delaware, California Bus. & Prof. Code § 22575 and 6 Del.C. § 1205C seek disclosure of how the website responds to web browser “do not track” signals or other mechanisms that provide consumers the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personal information about their online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services.  Although it is not clear that the statutes apply, we believe that an example might be a browser option allowing you to ask websites not to track you across third-party websites so that they can serve targeted or behavioral advertising to you.  You should not use the website if you desire a “do not track” signal, because the website will not honor it.
In addition to the above use, Petplan may share personal information with other companies or individuals outside of Petplan in the following limited circumstances: (a) to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) to enforce applicable Terms and Conditions of Use, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) to fulfill the purpose for which you provide the information; (d) for any purpose disclosed by us when you provide the information; (e) to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (f) to a buyer or other successor in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of our assets or business, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, in which personal and other information held by Petplan about our users is among the assets transferred; or (g) to protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of its users, or the public as required or permitted by law.
Petplan’s security and confidentiality procedures:
Petplan restricts access to your non-public personal information to Petplan employees and affiliates of Petplan, others who have a need to know that information in order to service a particular account or those that you have granted permission to receive such data through this policy or otherwise. Petplan also maintains physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in compliance with applicable laws and regulations to guard your personal information from unauthorized access, alteration or premature destruction.
Important regulatory concerns tied to the Internet, system vulnerabilities, social engineering and the possibility of third-party negligence or malfeasance are all reasons why Petplan cannot guarantee that information will remain absolutely confidential at all times. Although we take precautions to secure your information and apply reasonable safeguards, your own secure best practices and that of any third-parties that you use are also essential to maintaining a secure environment.
