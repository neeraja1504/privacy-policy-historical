Do Not Track
Some web browsers may give you the ability to enable a “do not track” setting that sends a special signal to the websites you encounter while web browsing. This is different form disabling certain forms of tracking by declining cookies in your browser settings, as browsers with the “do not track” setting enabled still have the ability to accept cookies. We do not respond to web browser “do not track” signals at this time. If we do so in the future, we will describe how we do so in this Privacy Policy. Our Websites may contain links to other websites of interest.
