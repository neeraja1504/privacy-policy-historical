Privacy Pledge
We share your concerns about privacy and how the information you submit to GolfDiscount.com is used. When you supply us with personal information, we make a commitment to you that the information will be used for internal use only and no information will be sold, rented or loaned to any third party. This includes contact information like your name and e-mail address, financial information like your credit card number and demographic information such as your address.
The information that we gather from you, our valued customer, is stored in our database on a secure server. When you place repeat orders from GolfDiscount.com, your personal information will be used to save you time by not having to ask for your name, address, phone, etc.
GolfDiscount.com may share additional personal and non-personal information with social media vendors, e.g. Facebook.
GolfDiscount.com occasionally sends special offers and discounts to those that request email alerts. There is an option to subscribe at checkout. Or, you can sign up from any page via the webform in the footer. We do not "spam" anyone, but if your server does have anti-spam software, it may read it as such and block it. If you are on the list but don't seem to be getting our alerts, this may be the reason. Contact your email administrator for solutions. You can get off the list at anytime by simply sending a blank email to remove@golfdiscount.com.
GolfDiscount.com also utilizes cookies to keep track of vital information during shopping cart transactions such as item numbers, user id, etc. Cookies do not gather information from the user's hard drive and pose no security risk. They also remember who you are and what items you have in your shopping cart. When you return to GolfDiscount.com, you don't have to waste time re-entering information. This would not be possible without those cookies. They are a useful and valuable thing for both user and server.
If you get annoying pop-up messages stating that "the server wants to place a cookie...accept or reject?", this means that your browser's preferences are set to ask each time a cookie is sent. Set this box to "always accept cookies" if you are going to use GolfDiscount.com's secure shopping cart and you will not get those messages.
This site contains links to other sites. GolfDiscount.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.
