Collective Data

Cookies can tell us how and when pages in a website are visited and by how many people.

With the information we can learn through this technology, we hope to improve our sites.

Additionally we track usage statistics to better understand how people interact with the site.

Links to Other Sites
As a resource to our visitors, GoldBanboo provides links to other websites. We try to carefully choose websites which we believe are useful and meet our high standards. However, because websites can change so quickly, we can't guarantee the standards of every website link we provide or be responsible for the content of non-GoldBamboo sites.
The sites displayed as search results or linked to by GoldBamboo's services are developed by people over whom GoldBamboo exercises no control. These other sites may place their own cookies on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information.
