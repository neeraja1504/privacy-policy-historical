Privacy Policy
PRIVACY POLICY
The following is the Privacy Policy of Running in the Rain that for the purposes of these terms is referred to as either RITR or GoldenGatePark.com.
Golden-Gate-Park.com supports a general policy of openness regarding personal data collection and use and so we have adopted this Privacy Policy as part of our commitment to protecting your personal information from misuse.
Golden-Gate-Park.com collects both personal information and aggregated information on our Web Sites.
PERSONAL INFORMATION
You are under no obligation to provide personal information in order to use any of our services. We gather personal information only when you provide it to us for example in answering surveys; entering contests, quizzes and/or sweepstakes; registering as a site member; registering to receive information from us; purchasing products through our website; participating in message boards or chats; purchasing items via promotions or from us; and taking part in other promotional opportunities. You may be asked to provide your contact information (such as your name, postal address, telephone numbers and/or email address), financial information (such as credit card numbers), and demographic information (such as your Zip code, age, or income level).
Please note that sites to which you can link from Golden-Gate-Park.com (including any affiliated, co-branded or third party sites) may have different terms and conditions or policies applicable to those sites and we urge you to check the privacy policy and terms and conditions on each such site. Please also bear in mind that Golden-Gate-Park.com is not responsible for the content or the policies of any of these sites.
Contact information is used to respond to your inquiries, to notify you if you have won a contest or a quiz and to send products and services ordered from our sites or sites, which are promoted from our sites. You also may receive periodic emails from us with information on new products and services, updates to our Web Sites or upcoming events.
Financial information that is collected is used only to process orders for products and services purchased through our Web Sites and is never shared with third parties for any other reason.
Demographic information is shared with advertisers and third parties only on an aggregated basis. (See the Aggregated Information Section below.)
Whenever we request your personal information on our Web Site, we will try to explain to you how we intend to use it and provide you with a choice to decline certain uses. In addition, if we plan to post any of your personal information on our Web Sites, other than usernames, (for example, your name and home town to identify you as the winner of a quiz), we will also use all reasonable efforts to notify you of this possibility either when you provide information to us or prior to posting the information. We may also be required to disclose personal information pursuant to valid legal process.
AGGREGATED INFORMATION
We gather information through our Web Site relating to traffic levels on our Web Site – for example, the total number of users visiting particular pages. We may also aggregate demographic information and the results of surveys.
We use IP addresses to calculate Web site usage levels. Whenever you are on the Internet, a number (an IP address) is automatically assigned to your computer. This number is identified and logged automatically whenever you visit our Web Sites. Collecting IP addresses is standard practice on the Internet, and is done automatically by many Web sites. An IP address does not provide us with any of your personally identifiable information, so although your session will be logged, you will remain anonymous to us.
This aggregated information, which does not personally identify you, is helpful to us for improving the services we offer and for marketing purposes. We may share aggregated information with our advertisers, business partners, or other companies.

THIRD-PARTY AD SERVING
