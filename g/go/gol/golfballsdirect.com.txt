Expected Shipping Times
It has been our experience that inclement weather and the homeland security alert level (particularly for packages traveling by plane, e.g. to Califonia) can and do influence travel times. We're internet shoppers ourselves and always appreciate fast service... in turn we work hard to provide the same for all our customers. Should your order encounter any delays we do apologize and thank you for your patience, understanding, and cooperation. Your questions are welcome and you may use our Live Chat (in the upper left navigation area) or call us toll free Monday through Friday from 9 am to 4 pm Eastern Standard Time.
If you need faster deliver and you would like to see a shipping estimate prior to beginning your checkout, you may do so by following these four easy steps:
1. Add the item(s) you would like a shipping estimate for to your shopping cart.
2. Proceed to checkout.
3. Enter your state / zip code information in the total box and click 'Recalculate'.
4. Choose a shipping shipping timeframe from the drop down menu labeled 'PLEASE SELECT' (after selecting a carrier from the carrier drop down box above).

Please note: For FedEX, a business day does not include Saturdays,Sundays, or holidays.
Example: You order golf balls on Monday that take 2 business days to arrive according to the map above. You do not count the day the order was placed as a business day, so your package would arrive on Wednesday, the second business day after the ship date. order.
