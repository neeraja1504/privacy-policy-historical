You have the legal right to ask us to supply you with a copy of the personal data that we hold about you at any time free of charge.  Further copies may incur a reasonable fee and also if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive (or we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances).

Transfers outside of the EEA: Where we need to transfer your data to a third party supplier or service provider based in a country located outside of the EEA,  for the purposes of the third party providing us with a service, we will ensure that either the country to which the data is to be transferred has an adequate level of protection for data (as determined by the European Commission) or we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe or where a supplier or service provider is based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they have certified to the Privacy Shield Framework Principles which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US.
Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.

These rules are called “binding corporate rules”.

This is necessary for our legitimate interests to be able to sell the company or its assets in the future, provided that we take all appropriate steps to keep your personal data confidential and secure at all times in accordance with this Policy and the Data Protection Laws, including requiring the third party to sign a confidentiality and non-disclosure agreement.
