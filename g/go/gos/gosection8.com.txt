This website (“Website”) is operated by Affordable Housing Network, LLC (“AHN” or the “Company”).  This privacy policy governs only the collection of information at the Website, and does not govern the collection of information through other means. Because our business will continue to evolve, we reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy from time to time.  Upon any change, we will post the revised policy here, and change the Effective Date noted above.  You are encouraged to check this page periodically so that you are aware of any changed.  If we do make changes, we may send to you, and you agree to receive (unless you have opted-out), an email notifying you about the changes.
Information Collected About You
We collect personal information about you whenever you voluntarily provide it to us through the Website, such as when you seek tenant data, place an order or register with us. We consider personal information to be information that identifies you personally, such as your name, credit card information, email and mail address, and telephone numbers.
We also collect or log non-personal information about you and your use of the Website. This information includes but is not limited to your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address and your domain name. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer by the Internet Service Provider (“ISP”) computer through which you access the Internet, and a domain name is the name of the ISP computer itself through which you access the Internet.
Use of Cookies
A “cookie” is a small piece of information placed on your computer that many web sites use to help make web browsing and shopping easier. This information is stored on your computer's hard drive. The Company does not store personal information in your cookie. We use cookies in order to improve your Website experience. If you choose to register with us, your cookie allows us to recognize you when you return to our site and provides you with access to your account information. Your cookie also assists us in keeping track of your shopping cart. If you request to receive emails from AHN, your cookie helps us deliver messages that we think might be of interest to you.

We also use your personal information to inform you of our other available products or services. We may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered.
We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer the Website.  Your IP address is used to help identify you and your shopping cart.  We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and to save your password so you don’t have to re-enter it each time you visit our site.
The Company may enter into strategic partnerships with third parties who may be given access to personal information including your name, address, telephone number and e-mail for the purpose of providing you with information regarding products and services that we think will be of interest to you.  Should you not wish to have your information shared with the Company’s strategic partners, you may opt-out by following the guidelines below.
We also employ third parties to perform functions on our behalf, such as sending communications, analyzing data, and providing marketing and/or customer services assistance. These third parties may have access to user personal information, to the extent that it is required in order to perform their duties. We may also disclose personal information at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation, to comply with valid legal processes such as a search warrant, subpoena, or court order, or to protect our rights and property or the property or personal safety of another user of the Website or any member of the public.
With non-personal information, we monitor site use and traffic patterns through server log files and cookies to improve our web site design and the products, courses, and services we offer.
We reserve the right to disclose, share and/or otherwise transfer user information, including without limitation personal information, in connection with a corporate merger, acquisition, consolidation, the sale of substantially all of company assets, or other fundamental corporate change, whatever form it may take.
