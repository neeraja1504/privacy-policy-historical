When you submit sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the encryption software which meets or exceeds industry standards - (Secure Socket Layer). While on a secure page, such as our order form which is hosted in a secure data facility, the lock icon on the bottom of web browsers such as Firefox, Google Chrome and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'.
