We may use the public content to develop aggregate ratings, personalize site views and market products. We may use your public content to personalize site views and identify or feature popular members. For example, we may provide giveaways to the best or most popular reviews and contributors. While we don't expect to transfer the complete review rating and web of trust database to others (except as discussed in this policy), we use the database throughout our network and to generate results for others.

At any time, you have the ability to opt out of receiving marketing communications from goshop.com.my, but you may not opt out of administrative emails (for example, emails about your information) while you are a member of the goshop.com.my. You can opt out by either changing your e-mail preferences or using the link provided at the bottom of each email message.
Email Tools. If you send emails to a recipient through our site, they will receive your email address and any personal message you include. Although we do not retain in any easily retrievable way the addresses you email, these emails are not private communications. You may not use our email tools to send spam or content that violates the User Agreement.
Anti-Spam Policy. goshop.com.my does not tolerate spam. We do not send emails to anyone without permission, and we do not sell or rent email addresses to any unauthorized third party.
