Your privacy is important to us and maintaining your trust is our priority. To ensure that your privacy is protected and your privacy choices are respected, Datapipe, Inc. and its group companies (collectively " Datapipe ", " we ", " our " and " us ") have set out in this Privacy Policy an explanation of our information practices as well as the decisions you may make regarding how your information is collected and used by us.

Introduction to Datapipe
Datapipe is a US-headquartered company which architects, deploys and manages hosting and other IT solutions for our clients.  In practical terms, this means we at times act on behalf of our clients to work with third party vendors like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft to ensure that our clients have cloud solutions fit for their business purposes.  We also provide a range of other services including our own data center services, systems management and IT security and compliance.
PART II.   WHAT WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT

However, you may give us personal information through our Website, for example, when you make enquiries about our Services or provide us with your contact information for the purpose of sending you white papers, signing up to our newsletter or obtaining a quote or arranging a consultation. Our clients are also able to provide us with updated billing information through our Website, if they wish to do so. When you communicate with us, we will keep copies of any communications that you send us.
We will also collect user account information (such as name, email addresses and telephone numbers) when you register an account with us. If you are an administrator or manager utilizing our Services and wish to set up accounts on behalf of other users (such as your employees), you must ensure you are fully authorized to do so, which means - for example - making sure that the individual concerned is aware of your use of their personal information, that you are lawfully entitled to disclose it to us and that they are informed of their rights in respect of that information.

PART III.   INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS AND SECURITY
Processing of information in the U.S. and elsewhere
Information collected outside of the United States, including in the European Economic Area, may be transferred to the United States.  Your information may be stored on our servers in the United States and potentially in other countries whose data protection laws may be different to the laws in your country.  We will protect your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy wherever it is processed.
In particular, please note that where clients have requested that we deploy cloud services with Datapipe or other infrastructure provider (for example, AWS or Microsoft Azure), that infrastructure provider may give you the option to choose the location or region in which you wish to host your data.  In such circumstances, the client is solely responsible for deciding which location is adequate for the purposes of the data it wishes to host, taking into account the nature and the sensitivity of the data in question.
EU-US Privacy Shield
When processing personal information from the European Economic Area, Datapipe, Inc. and its US subsidiaries have certified our compliance with the EU-US Privacy Shield and we commit to adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfers, Security, Data Integrity & Purpose Limitation, Access, Recourse, Enforcement and Liability. To access the Privacy Shield List and to find details of our certification, please see https://www.privacyshield.gov/.
Datapipe, Inc. and its US subsidiaries are subject to the investigation and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission.
When we transfer personal information to third party agents, we will contractually require that they process your personal information only for the purposes described in this policy and to provide the same level of protection as the Privacy Shield Principles. It is our responsibility to ensure that our third party agents and service providers protect your data in accordance with the commitments contained in this Privacy Policy, and we will be responsible under the Privacy Shield for their processing of your data, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the damage.
If you believe your information has not been processed in accordance with the Privacy Shield Principles, you can make a complaint in the following ways:
(1) You can contact us directly at privacyshield@datapipe.com or at the mailing address below and we will respond to your complaint within 45 days of receipt:
ATTN: Legal Department, Datapipe, Inc., 10 Exchange Place, Jersey City, NJ 07302, USA
(2) We have further committed to cooperate and comply with the panel of the European data protection authorities (DPAs) in the resolution of your Privacy Shield complaint.

Where appropriate, your local data protection authority may refer your complaint to the US Department of Commerce or the Federal Trade Commission for further investigation.
US-Swiss Safe Harbor

Security
We use appropriate technical, organizational and administrative measures to help protect any information we process about our clients or their users.  Please note that when a client instructs us to host data with a third party infrastructure provider, that provider will have its own technical, organizational and administrative measures to protect the data it processes.  It is our clients' responsibility to assess the appropriateness of the security measures in place with any third party infrastructure provider before it instructs us to arrange hosting with that provider on its behalf.
In addition, we offer certain optional security protections that our clients may choose to deploy.  These optional security protections are not provided by default and will not be implemented unless expressly agreed with our clients at the time they order Services from us.  It is our clients' responsibility to assess the need for and appropriateness of these optional security protections, taking into account the nature and the sensitivity of their data.
Please note that no service is completely secure and so, while we endeavor to protect our clients' information using the measures described above, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss or a data breach will not occur although we shall at all times utilize commercially reasonable measures to protect your Data. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, you should only access the Services within a secure environment. You should always ensure that your login credentials and password are kept safe at all times. You should notify us as soon as possible if you become aware of any misuse of your password or your account, and immediately change your password within the service.
PART IV. YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS
Update and access to your information
If you are from certain territories (such as the EU or Switzerland),  you may have the right to access your personal information, or to correct, amend and delete any personal information we hold about you if it is inaccurate or processed in violation of the Privacy Shield or Safe Harbor Principles. You can send an email to privacyshield@datapipe.com, or call us on 201-792-1918 for this purpose.  We will consider your request in accordance with the Privacy Shield and Swiss Safe Harbor Principles and any applicable laws. We may reject requests where, for example, the burden or expense of providing access to your information is disproportionate, or where your request violates the rights of third parties.
For any personal information that is stored or processed by us through the Services on our client's behalf (see "Client Data" section above), Datapipe is acting as a data processor.  This means that if you wish to access, review, modify or delete any such personal information, you should direct your query to your client (the data controller).  We will then help them to fulfil that request in accordance with their instructions and our Privacy Shield and other contractual commitments.
