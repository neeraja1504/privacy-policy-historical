Updates to Our Privacy and Cookie Policy
1. Information Collected through our Services
The airlines on whose planes the Services are available do not collect any information through your use of the Services, but we may share certain types of information with such airlines, as described below. Please remember that this Privacy and Cookie Policy only covers your activities while on the Gogo Domains; to the extent you visit external party websites, including the websites of our airline partners, the privacy policies of those websites will govern. Users who reside outside of the United States should note that their information will be held and processed in the United States. In certain circumstances, foreign courts, law enforcement agencies or regulatory agencies may be entitled to access your personal information without notice to you. By accepting this Privacy Policy, whether by establishing an Account (as defined below), signing-in to your Account, accessing the Services as a guest, or otherwise using the Services, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing.
Personal Information You Provide to Us
When using the Services, you will, in most cases, be required to provide information that could reasonably be used to contact you, or to identify you personally, or that otherwise relates to your person (such as your name, mailing or billing address, telephone number, or email address, email preferences, password for your Account and password hint question, and a complete set of credit card information that enables us to receive your payment (including your credit card authorization number) (collectively, "Personal Information")). For example, Gogo may collect Personal Information when you register on the Sites, purchase Services, request information, submit comments or participate in some promotion, survey or other feature of the Sites, or otherwise communicate or interact with us. In addition, you may choose to provide contact information for friends you may wish us to contact. When you provide us information for these "refer a friend" messages, we use the information only to send the message you request and the information will not be used for other marketing purposes unless your friend consents. You may be identified to the friend in connection with such message. Please check that friends you refer are happy for us to contact them. The Sites may also ask you to provide other information about yourself, such as demographic information (gender, zip code, age, etc.) or certain information about your preferences, product use and interests.
Information Collected by Automated Means
Whenever you use the Services, Gogo, as well as any of our external-party advertisers and/or service providers, may use a variety of tools and technologies that automatically or passively collect information about how the Services are accessed and used ("Usage Information"). Usage Information may include, among other things, browser type, operating system, the page served, the time, the type of content being transmitted (e.g., video content) or application being used, how many users visited the Sites, origin and destination information, flight information, subscriber status and preceding page views. This data helps us to manage our network and provides us with information about the use of the Services, such as how many visitors visit a specific page on the Sites, how long they stay on that page, and which hyperlinks, if any, they "click" on. This information helps us to keep the Services fresh and interesting to our visitors and to tailor content to a visitor’s interests. Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but if Gogo associates it with you as a specific and identifiable person, Gogo treats it as Personal Information. Gogo also collects your network traffic information, including information sent to or received from the websites you visit. We will not use this network traffic information for any purpose other than to administer the Services, such as to maintain and secure our network and to help you with Service-related questions, or as may be required by law or by law enforcement officers acting under the color of law.
Device Identifiers
In the course of collecting Usage Information, Gogo also automatically collects your IP address, MAC Address or other unique identifier ("Device Identifier") for the computer, mobile device, Wi-Fi card, technology or other device (collectively, "Device") you use to access the Services. A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device when you access a website or its servers, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. When you visit the Sites, we may view your Device Identifier. We use this information to determine the physical location of your Device, including origin, destination, flight route information, and longitude and latitude information. We also may use this information to enhance the Services and we may associate your Device Identifier with your Personal Information. The technologies used on the Services to collect Usage Information, including Device Identifiers, may include, without limitation:
Cookies
Cookies are data files placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Sites or access the Services ("Cookies"). For example, we may use Cookies to collect and store certain information about your Account or to facilitate your use of the Service as a guest. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them). The types, use and duration of the Cookies used are as follows:
Type of Cookies | Purpose of Use | Duration
---|---|---
Session Cookies | Session Cookies ensure that you are recognized when you move from page to page within the Sites and that any information you have entered is remembered. For example, session Cookies ensure that items placed in a shopping basket don’t disappear by the time you reach the checkout. You can choose not to accept session Cookies by changing the settings in your browser. | Session Cookies expire once you close your web browser.
Persistent Cookies |
Persistent Cookies help the Sites remember your information and settings when you visit them in the future. This results in faster and more convenient access.
Features of the Service made possible by persistent Cookies include: authentication, language selection, theme selection, menu preferences, internal site bookmarks or favorites, among others. Cookies may enhance your online experience by saving your preferences while you are visiting a particular Site.
Persistent Cookies also allow us to select which of our advertisements or offers are most likely to appeal to you and display them while you are using the Services.

If you would prefer not to accept Cookies, most browsers will allow you to: (i) change your browser settings to notify you when you receive a Cookie, at which time you can choose whether or not to accept it; (ii) disable existing Cookies; or (iii) set your browser to automatically reject any Cookies.

Web Beacons
We may also include web beacons (also known as Internet tags, pixel tags, tracking beacons and clear GIFs) with the content and ads that we deliver to you, which we will use to collect information regarding your interaction with such content and ads.

7. Advertising; How to Opt-out
Gogo licenses technology to serve advertisements on its own Sites and within its content as that content is served across the Internet. In addition, Gogo may use external party analytics vendors to evaluate and provide us with information about the use of the Services and viewing of our content. We do not share Personal Information with these external parties, but ad network providers, the advertisers, the sponsors, and/or analytics service providers may set and access their own Cookies, pixel tags and similar technologies on your Device and they may otherwise collect or have access to information about you, including Usage Information. We and our network advertisers may target advertisements for products and services in which you might be interested based on your use of the Services, visits to the Sites and other websites. We may use a variety of companies to serve advertisements.
If you prefer to not receive targeted advertising, you can opt-out of some network advertising programs that use your information. To do so please visit the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) Opt-Out Page: http://www.aboutads.info/choices. European users can also go to http://www.youronlinechoices.com. Please note that even if you choose to remove your information (opt-out), you will still see advertisements while you’re browsing online. Additionally, many network advertising programs allow you to view and manage the interest categories they have compiled from your online browsing activities. These interest categories help determine the types of targeted advertisements you may receive. The DAA Opt-Out Page provides a tool that identifies its member companies that have Cookies on your browser and provides links to those companies.

8. Links to Other Sites
Our provision of links to other websites or locations is for your convenience and does not signify our endorsement of such other websites or location or its contents. We have no control over, do not review and cannot be responsible for these outside websites or their content. These other websites may send their own Cookies to your Device, may independently collect data or solicit Personal Information and may or may not have their own privacy policies. Please be aware that the terms of our Privacy and Cookie Policy do not apply to these outside websites. You should independently assess the authenticity of any website which appears to be or claims that it is one of our Sites (including those linked to through an email or social networking page).
back to top
9. How We Protect Personal Information
The connection through which you access the Services is an SSL-encrypted link. However, following such initial access, due to multiple users of our inflight Wi-Fi access point, Gogo does not provide an encrypted communication channel, such as Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), or Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA2), between our in-flight Wi-Fi access point and your Device. Gogo’s inflight internet connectivity service generally supports secure Virtual Private Network (VPN) and Secure Shell (SSH) access. If you have VPN, Gogo recommends that you use secure VPN protocols for greater security. Subject to the network management and limitations provisions discussed in our terms of use for the inflight internet connectivity service (accessible inflight at https://buy.gogoinflight.com/upp/terms.do and on the ground at http://www.gogoair.com/terms), SSL-encrypted websites or pages, typically indicated by "https" in the address field and a "lock" icon, can also generally be accessed through the inflight internet connectivity service. You should be aware, however, that data packets from un-encrypted Wi-Fi connections can be captured by technically advanced means when they are transmitted between a user’s Device and the Wi-Fi access point. You should therefore take precautions to lower your security risks. Gogo recommends that you follow good security practices, such as ensuring that file-sharing is not enabled while accessing the Internet from an un-encrypted public network and that laptops have a personal firewall and other protections against malware. Gogo recommends that sensitive or private information should not be accessed via or transmitted over an un-encrypted connection. While Gogo takes reasonable steps to protect your security, please be aware that we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you use the Services and provide us with your information at your own risk.

10. Children
