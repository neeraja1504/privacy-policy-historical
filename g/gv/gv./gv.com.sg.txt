4) OUR DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION
As a matter of policy, we will not disclose or sell any of your personal data to third parties for their marketing purposes without your express consent. However, the following describes some of the ways information may be disclosed in the normal course of business to third parties in the provision of our services.
Advertisers. We aggregate (gather up data across all user accounts) personal data and disclose such information as anonymised data to advertisers and other third parties for market analysis and consumer research. In such cases, we do not disclose to these third parties any information that could be used to identify you personally. In particular, we will not disclose sensitive information about you, such as your name, email address, password, credit card number, and bank account number, to these third parties without your express consent.
Internal Service Providers for Our Operations.We may use third parties that we refer to as internal service providers to facilitate or outsource one or more aspects of the business, product and service operations that we provide to you (e.g., search technology, discussion boards, bill collection, affiliate and rewards programs, co-branded credit cards) and therefore we may provide some of your personal data directly to these internal service providers. These internal service providers are subject to confidentiality and data protection obligations and other legal restrictions that prohibit their use of the information we provide them for any other purpose except to facilitate the specific outsourced operation, unless you have expressly agreed or given your prior permission to them for other purposes. In some instances, the internal service provider may collect information directly from you. In these cases, you will be notified of the involvement of the internal service provider, and all information that you provide to them and their use of the information will be strictly between you and the internal service provider. If you provide personal data directly to an internal service provider, then their use of the personal data that you provide to them will be governed by their applicable privacy policy.
Other Corporate Entities. We share much of our data, including your personal data, with our related companies, subsidiaries and joint venture partners that are committed to serving your online transactions and related services, throughout the world. To the extent that these entities have access to your personal data, they will be required to treat your personal data with at least the same level of protection as we treat your personal data.
5) CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY
Your information is stored on our servers located in Singapore. We use procedural and technical safeguards to protect your personal data against loss or theft as well as unauthorized access and disclosure to protect your privacy, including encryption, "firewalls" and Secure Socket Layers. We treat personal data as an asset that must be protected against loss and unauthorized access. We employ many different security techniques to protect such data from unauthorized access by users inside and outside the company. If you are aware of any security breach, please let us know as soon as possible.
We have internal procedures in place requiring our employees and data processors to respect the confidentiality of any personal data held by us.
However, as you can appreciate, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet, so we cannot give an absolute assurance that the information you provide to us will be secure at all times, and we cannot be held responsible for any event arising from unauthorised access to your personal data that was not due to our default or negligence. We will not be held responsible for events arising from third parties gaining unauthorised access to your personal data that was beyond our control.
6) LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES
Our website, mobile applications and online purchase confirmation emails, may contain links to other websites, whose data protection and privacy practices may differ from ours. We are not responsible for the content and privacy policies of these other companies and we encourage you to consult their privacy policies before using their websites.

We reserve the right to update this Policy from time to time as we expand our services. We will post a notice on our home page to inform you that an update has been made. Your use of the website or mobile application after this Policy has been updated will be deemed acceptance of the updated Policy.
