Use of the GCU Wi-Fi Network for On-Campus Students
GCU's Internet network is guarded by a firewall that protects on-campus students from entering sites that may be unsafe or not in keeping with our Christian values. Sites are selected by category to filter usage. Seven categories are set to make the site unavailable, but pressing the "Continue" button allows you through to the site. These site topics include, but are not limited to, drugs, illegal activities, gambling and other questionable sites.
There are eight categories that are identified to make sites wholly unavailable, including, but not limited to pornography, cheating websites, malware, key loggers and sites that promote terrorist activities. The Learning Management System and eBooks websites are specifically white-listed to ensure students are always able to access them. If you feel a blocked website should be made available, contact the Office of Residence Life, and your request will be reviewed.
NOTE: The LOPES network, GCU's student intranet, does not authenticate students prior to allowing site access, and their web filter's reporting capabilities are limited to big-picture summaries that describe general usage. Reporting on individual students will not be possible. GCU does not proactively monitor usage or sites visited.
