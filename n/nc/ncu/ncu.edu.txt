Use of Cookies and Web Beacons
A "cookie" is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page, which helps Northcentral recall your specific information on subsequent visits.
A "Web beacon" is typically a small transparent graphic image that works with cookies to count and recognize users, and track movement from point to point within a server network.
Northcentral Web sites use cookies to help you personalize your online experience. When you return to the same Northcentral Web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved so that you can easily use the features that you customized.
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Northcentral services or Web sites you visit.

Northcentral offers its Students choices for the collection, use, and sharing of personal information. You may go to the Profile page to proactively make choices about the use and sharing of your personal information.
