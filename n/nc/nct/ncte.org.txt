If any member takes actions to attempt to use technological means to access information of other members through the website in contravention of this policy, NCTE reserves the right to terminate that member.
The NCTE uses demographic and professional information collected on membership, convention, and other forms for de-identified aggregate analysis, to personalize our member records for better service, and to create targeted mailing lists. This information is also included in convention attendee lists supplied to convention exhibitors and other responsible third parties. In addition to the primary purpose stated or implied at the time the information is collected, we may use your postal mailing address to send you information about NCTE programs or products, surveys, etc. If you supply personal information, such as an email address, we use it to confirm any orders you may place through the Website, follow up on a request, or other such actions as the context determines. We may also use it to keep you informed about NCTE programs and initiatives. On occasion, we may use your e-mail address for a purpose indirectly related to the original context (e.g., e-mailing a customer satisfaction survey to those who have made purchases from the NCTE catalog or in the NCTE online store).
It is important to note that we provide our convention attendee information, including certain personally identifiable information about you, to convention exhibitors and may make it available to others under certain circumstances. We also make our member data available to companies offering NCTE member benefits and other responsible third parties. With the exception of the convention attendee data, NCTE does not make its e-mail lists available to any third party, including other members of NCTE. Personal information is also collected in the following areas, but is not reused in any form for any “secondary” purpose:
Participation in special programs
E-mail newsletter sent to nonmembers
