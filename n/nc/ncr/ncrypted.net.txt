Your Rights and Choices
Unsubscribe
We may provide you with the opportunity to 'Unsubscribe' - the unsubscribe link can be found at the bottom of every promotional or marketing newsletter email that you receive from us. If you decide to opt-out, we may not be able to provide certain features of the Offerings to you.
Opt-Out
Unsubscribing immediately removes you from our marketing list(s), however an individual key contact from our sales, marketing and/or business development team may still connect with you. If you wish not to be contacted by any of our individual team members as well, please kindly reply to the individual with 'opt-out' in your email subject or body.
Blocking Cookies
You can remove or block certain cookies using the settings in your browser but the Offerings may cease to function properly if you do so.
How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals
Your Web browser may have a “do not track” setting which, when enabled, causes your browser to send a do not track HTTP header file or “signal” to each site you visit. At present, the Offerings do not respond to this type of signal.
Data Subject Rights
You can access, rectify, erase, restrict or export your personal information at any time by emailing us at newsletter@ncrypted.com. You can object to our processing of your personal information at any time. Contact our Data Protection Officer with requests or concerns at newsletter@ncrypted.com. If you are unsatisfied with the response you have the right to lodge a complaint with your supervisory authority.
Accessing and Updating Your Personal Information
When you use the Offerings, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information upon your request and either provide you the means to correct this information if it is inaccurate or to delete such information at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. You may access, review, correct, update, change or delete your information at any time. To do so, please contact us at newsletter@ncrypted.com with your name and email ID and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed. If you are using the Service (any of our product demo), log in to your account, go to Your Account Settings, and make the desired changes. We may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), jeopardize the privacy of others, would be extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort.
Please note that if you cease using the Service or we terminate your access to the Service in accordance with your Terms Of Website Use, or Service Level Agreement, you may no longer have the ability to access or request to update your information.
We may retain your information as necessary to support the Offerings, comply with our legal obligations or resolve disputes. Note that content you post on our Offerings (including, but not limited to any of our products demo) may remain on the Offerings even if you cease using the Offerings or we terminate your access to the Offerings.
No Children Under Age 16
The Offerings are not intended for use by anyone under the age of 16, nor does NCrypted knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 16. If you are under 16, you may not attempt to register for the Offerings or send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. In the event that we confirm that we have collected personal information from someone under the age of 16 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information promptly. If you are a parent or legal guardian of a child under 16 and believe that we might have any information from or about such child, please contact us at the email or mailing address provided at the end of this Privacy Policy.
Security
The security of your personal information is important to us. We maintain a variety of appropriate technical and organizational safeguards to protect your personal information. We limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs. Further, we have implemented reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards designed to protect personal information about you. We encrypt certain confidential and sensitive information in transit using industry-standard encryption technology. Most of our websites are also secured using 128 bit SSL certificates. While we strive to use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
