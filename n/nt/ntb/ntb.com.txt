f. Submits an e-mail address for use by TBC Corporation.
g. Subscribes to receive e-mail from TBC Corporation.
h. Participates in a click to chat/live chat session.
TBC Corporation's primary goal in collecting any information that personally identifies a user is to fulfill website user requests and orders. A website user may be asked to provide contact and/or credit card information in connection with an order. If we have trouble processing an order or request, completing delivery of an order or other similar issue, this contact information will be used by TBC Corporation or a third party working on our behalf to contact the user.
TBC Corporation’s websites may retain information from any participant in a click to chat/live chat session. By participating in a click to chat/live chat session, you are agreeing that TBC and any Agent representing or working on behalf of TBC can record and/or retain your information. Information provided to click to chat/live chat participants is informational only and should not be relied on as the sole basis for making a decision. TBC and its subsidiaries and/or affiliates are not liable for any information provided and/or the consequences thereof via a click to chat/live chat session.
A user of the click to chat/live chat should not provide personally identifiable information (such as date of birth, social security number, credit card number, etc.) on the click to chat/live chat system. Any user who does so hereby does so at his or her own risk and agrees to release TBC Corporation and its subsidiaries and/or affiliates from any liability, damages, or causes of action relating thereto.
You may choose not to provide us with any personally-identifying information. In that case, you can still access and use many portions of our websites; however, you will not be able to access and use those portions of any TBC Corporation website that requires your personal information.
