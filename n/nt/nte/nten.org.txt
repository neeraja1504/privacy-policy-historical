Privacy Policy | NTEN
NTEN is committed to protecting the privacy of our members and website users. This policy explains what types of information is collected by NTEN’s websites, including but not limited to nten.org, community.nten.org, local.nten.org, the Nonprofit Technology Conference mobile app, and the NTEN Stories mobile app, and explains how that information is used.
No data transmission over the internet is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of such information.
What information do we collect?
Information you provide
When you create an account on an NTEN website, sign up to receive NTEN electronic newsletters, or register for events, you voluntarily provide us with personal information (such as name and email address). We may use this information for specific, limited purposes that are outlined below. You may opt out, either now or at any time in the future, if you do not wish to receive our messages.
IP addresses
NTEN uses your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer websites, tailor content to your location, and for metrics used to track website visitor traffic.
Cookies
NTEN websites and apps use cookies to automatically help provide better services. They remind us who you are and your preferences for our website based on what you’ve done and told us before. The cookie is placed in your computer and is read when you come back to our website. Cookies let us take you to the information and features you’re particularly interested in, and we use them to serve you ads in other networks. They also let us track your usage of our sites, so we know which parts of our sites are most popular. You can reject cookies or cancel them by instructing your web browser accordingly.
How do we use this information?
Member Directory
NTEN maintains a directory for the purpose of helping members of our community connect with one another. When you become a member or sign up for an online community profile at an NTEN website, your name, organization, mailing address, phone, and email address are added to our Member Directory. You can change which information is shown to members and the public by changing the privacy settings in your profile.
Nonprofit Technology Conference
The names of all registrants to the Nonprofit Technology Conference (NTC) will be listed in the NTC mobile app. Attendees are able to manage or opt out of this listing.
The dietary accommodation information we collect is stored only in our database’s event registration record and is used only in aggregate. Accessibility requests and related information are stored only in our database’s event registration record. We will request your permission before we connect you with our accessibility service providers, or you can opt to meet them onsite only.
Email Communications
We publish several electronic newsletters on a monthly basis, including Connect and Member News. We also send announcements about NTEN events and services to our community. Any data we gather about email communications behavior (such as opens and clicks) is used only to help us send you the most relevant communications.
NTEN does not provide, sell, or rent email addresses or other communications data to anyone outside the organization for any price at any time, although we may occasionally send an announcement, event, or product offering that we think may be of interest on behalf of a partner. We also provide the opportunity for you to opt in for communications from vendors and conference exhibitors.
You can unsubscribe or update your email preferences any time from the link included at the bottom of every email, or by contacting us (editor@nten.org or 503-272-8800).
Security
SSL Encryption
Information flowing between our sites, its API providers and its users is secured by industry-standard SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption. We encrypt all traffic to our sites, including anything you submit through your nten.org user profile, all purchases through our cart, and all single sign-on requests to our community.nten.org discussion forums and our Adobe-based learning management system.
External Links
Our sites include links to external websites. These links do not fall under any of our domains, and therefore NTEN is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of external websites. Your use of any linked website is solely at your own risk.
Your responsibility to protect privacy
By using NTEN websites and apps, you agree to protect the privacy of others by keeping their information private. For example, do not share email addresses and phone numbers listed in the Member Directory at community.nten.org, which you have access to as a member benefit. For more information on privacy and our online groups, please view the community guidelines.
Modifications
We may amend this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page; please review it periodically. Your continued use of our websites will be deemed to be your agreement to the changed terms.
Contact us
If you have any concerns about privacy at nten.org or any of our websites, or to request that your data be removed, please contact us.
