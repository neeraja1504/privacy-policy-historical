Privacy Policy
ASG Technologies Group, Inc. (“ASG” “we” “us”) has adopted this Privacy Policy (“Policy”) to govern its collection, use and disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information.  In addition, this Policy is designed to assist ASG in maintain an adequate level of Personal Data privacy protection. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, this Policy applies to the processing of Personal Data that ASG or its affiliates (together the “ASG Group”) obtains from Individual Customers located in the European Union (“EU”) and Switzerland.
ASG complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries, the EEA and Switzerland, respectively. ASG has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability. If there is any conflict between the policies in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/.
The Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) has jurisdiction over ASG’s compliance with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield programs.
All ASG employees who handle Personal Data from Europe and Switzerland are required to comply with this Policy.
Capitalized terms are defined in Section 17 of this Policy.

2. SCOPE
This Policy does not cover data from which individual persons cannot be identified or situations in which pseudonyms are used. (The use of pseudonyms involves the replacement of names or other identifiers with substitutes so that identification of individual persons is not possible.)  This Policy does not cover information collected by the ASG Group regarding its employees or contractors.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES AND MANAGEMENT
ASG has designated its Legal and Information Security Departments to supervise its corporate-wide information security program, including its compliance with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Frameworks.

Any questions, concerns, or comments regarding this Policy also may be directed to privacy@asg.com.
ASG will maintain, monitor, test, and upgrade information security policies, practices, and systems to assist in protecting the personal information that it collects. ASG personnel will receive training, as applicable, to effectively implement this Policy. Please refer to Section 8 for a discussion of the steps that ASG has undertaken to protect Personal Data.
4. RENEWAL / VERIFICATION
ASG will renew its EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield certifications annually, unless it subsequently determines that it no longer needs such certifications or if it employs a different adequacy mechanism.
Prior to the re-certification, ASG will conduct an in-house verification to ensure that its attestations and assertions with regard to its treatment of Individual Customer Personal Information are accurate and that the company has appropriately implemented these practices. Specifically, as part of the verification process, ASG will undertake the following:
1. Review this Policy as also publicly posted on its website to ensure that it accurately describes the practices regarding the collection of Individual Customer Personal Information;

17. DEFINED TERMS
Capitalized terms in this Policy have the following meanings:
“ Individual Customer ” means any enterprise which as an individual current, prospective or former customer is or has been or intends to be a business client of the ASG Group. The term also shall include any individual agent, representative, of an individual customer of the ASG Group.
“ Data Controller ” means the ASG Group which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of Personal Data (or where applicable, Personally Identifiable Information).
“ Data Subject ” means an identified or identifiable natural living person. An identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, by reference to a name, or to one or more factors unique to his or her personal physical, psychological, mental, economic, cultural or social characteristics. For ASG, a Data Subject can be an Individual Customer or a user of its website.  For Individual Customers or website users residing in Switzerland, a Data Subject also may include a legal entity. Notwithstanding, a partnership, sole trader, association or cooperation may also be a data subject.
“ Employee ” means an employee (whether temporary, permanent, part-time, or contract), or independent contractor, or job applicant of ASG or any of its affiliates or subsidiaries.
“ Europe ” or “ European ” refers to a country in the European Union or the European Economic Area (“EEA”).
“ Personal Data ” as defined under the European Union Regulation 2016/679 means data that directly identifies or may be used to indirectly identify a natural person either by reference to one identifying element (for example, but not limited to, name, job title and role, user ID, email address, phone number) or in combination with one or more factors specific to the identity of that person (for example, but not limited to, user ID, password, and customer number). Personal Data does not include data that is de-identified, anonymous, or has been manifestly made public by the natural person. For Switzerland, the term “ person ” includes both a natural person and a legal entity, regardless of the form of the legal entity. Notwithstanding, a partnership, sole trader, association or cooperation may also be a “person”.
“ Personally Identifiable Information ” means individually identifiable information about an individual natural person, including any of the following:  the individual’s first and last name; home or other physical address, including street name and name of a city or town; e-mail address; telephone number; social security number; any other identifier that permits the physical or online contacting of a specific individual; or information concerning a user that the website or online service collects online from the user and maintains in personally identifiable form in combination with another identifier.
For ease of comprehension, Personal Data and Personally Identifiable Information shall be referred to jointly as Individual Customer Personal Information or simply as personal information where the context permits such indistinct use.
“ Sensitive Data ” means personal information that discloses for example, but not exhaustively, a Data Subject’s medical or health condition, race or ethnicity, political, religious or philosophical affiliations or opinions, sexual orientation, or trade union membership.
“ Third Party ” means any individual or entity that is neither ASG nor an ASG employee, agent, contractor, or representative.
