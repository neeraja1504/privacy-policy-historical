Consumer Privacy Notice - Northern Trust Corporation
Privacy at Northern Trust - Keeping Your Finances a Private Matter
When it comes to your financial affairs, you expect a relationship built on privacy and integrity. Thatâ€™s why Northern Trust does not sell client lists or any other client information to outside companies.
This notice outlines what we do to protect your personal information and describes how you can limit the sharing of this information. If you already have instructed us not to share this information, you do not need to do anything. We will continue to honor your request.
Keeping Your Information Secure
To keep information confidential and appropriately protected, we have policies that limit access to your personal information to only those employees who need it to perform their jobs and provide services to you. We also maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard your personal information.
Collecting Information
We collect information you provide us on applications, forms, through our web sites, and in conversation; from third parties with your permission; from your transactions with us, our affiliates and our joint marketing partners; and from consumer reporting agencies.
Sharing Information
Only under certain circumstances, and only as permitted by law, will we disclose any of this information about our clients and former clients to unaffiliated third parties, such as companies that perform marketing and other services for us.
In addition, we may share information we collect about our clients and former clients with our affiliated financial institutions, such as a Northern Trust Bank in another state. And we may share information with other financial institutions with which we have joint marketing agreements, such as Northern Funds.
Your Privacy Preferences
Northern Trust respects your right to restrict the information we disclose to our affiliates and joint marketing partners for marketing purposes. You may direct us not to share information about you for marketing purposes by:
Calling 1-866-260-9550 , Monday through Friday, 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Central Time
Writing to us at Northern Trust, P.O. Box 92929, Chicago, IL 60675
Or stopping in one of our locations
If you have a joint account or have a guarantor of your account at Northern, we will assume your request applies only to your information, unless you tell us otherwise.
Please note that even if you ask us not to share information for marketing purposes, we still may share that information for other reasons, such as to service your existing accounts. In addition, the Northern Trust affiliate that originally collected the information still may use it for its own marketing decisions.
Keeping You Informed
If our information-sharing practices change, we will send you a revised notice. You also can return to this page on our web site, to view the most current privacy notice.
