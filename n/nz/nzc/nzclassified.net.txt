With whom do we share your information?
NZClassified.net will not disclose your personal information unless we have your permission or under special circumstances. NZClassified.net may disclose account information only when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating the Terms of Service of NZClassified.net or if it is causing injury to or interference in rights or property, other users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.

We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. NZClassified.net will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email. As an extra security precaution, you may want to logoff once you have completed a session in NZClassified.net This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe.
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, NZClassified.net cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us from our online services, you do so at your own risk. However once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.
What else should you know about your online privacy?
