“Personal information” means information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. This Privacy Policy sets out what personal information we may collect from you, how we use it, how we disclose it, how we protect it and your choices regarding your personal information. This Policy applies across all of our platforms, to all of NZFC’s activities and to all products and services offered by NZFC.

In particular, you give your consent to the processing of your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will take effect when they are updated on this page. Please check frequently for updates. If we make significant changes, we will notify you of the changes through the NZFC Websites or through others means, such as email. To the extent permitted under applicable law, by using our services after such notice, you consent to our updates to this policy.
If you do not agree to any change we make, you should immediately stop using NZFC’s services and the NZFC Websites.
Please read this Privacy Policy carefully.
Why do we collect personal information?
NZFC collects, uses and discloses personal information to carry out our functions, to provide you with products and services, to market our functions, products and services and to meet our legal obligations.
Who do we collect personal information about?
We collect and hold personal information about:
persons we deal with in the course of carrying out our functions and individuals associated with those persons;
individuals we provide products, services and introductions/referrals to;
persons who apply to us for funding or support and individuals associated with those persons (e.g. employees or contractors);
suppliers and their employees and contractors;
prospective employees, employees and contractors; and
other individuals who come into contact with us.
What personal information do we collect?
The type of personal information we collect depends on the purpose for collection and circumstances of collection, but may include:
identifying information, such as your name, date of birth, citizenship or residency and appearance;
contact information, such as your postal address, telephone number, facsimile address, email address and social media handles/accounts;
payment information (if you are paying us), such as credit card details, including number, expiry date, cardholder name and billing address;
payment information (if we are paying you), such as bank account details, including number, branch, SWIFT code, account holder;
special categories of personal information, such as personal information that reveals political opinions, religious or philosophical belief, trade union membership, health status, sex life or sexual orientation;

website user data, collected when you visit the NZFC Websites. Website user data may include your IP address, cookies, device information, unique device identifiers, operating system and version and mobile network information.
Special categories of personal information
Some personal information, including information that reveals tribal affiliations, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical belief, trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data, health status, sex life or sexual orientation is treated as a special category of personal data under the GDPR. Generally, we will limit our collection of personal information that falls into this category, however, sometimes this type of information may be relevant to our interactions with you. By providing us with personal information that falls within this category, you explicitly consent to this information being processed for the purposes in clause 4.
Non-personal information
NZFC and its service providers engaged in performing its role as a national film agency, including providing the NZFC Websites, may collect information that is not personal information (i.e. it is not attributable to you individually). The purpose of this is to ensure NZFC can further develop existing services and investigate new services that enable NZFC to better assist with the development and marketing of NZ films in its capacity as a national film agency.
If we do combine non-personal information with personal information the combined information will be treated as personal information.
How do we collect personal information?
Direct collection
We may collect personal information directly from you, including in the following circumstances:
when you interact with us in person, on the phone or via email;
when you submit an application to us for funding or support;

when you enter information into an online form, such as an online survey;
when you sign up for a User Account in our Film Application Portal or submit information via your User Account;
when you sign up for a Member Account on NZ Film on Demand or update your information on your Member Account; and

Are you required to provide personal information to us?
In general, we will let you know at the time of collection whether the provision of personal information to us is optional or whether it is required for us to provide you with products or services or to perform our functions in relation to you.
If we have indicated that the requested personal information is required and you do not provide it, we will not be able to provide you with some or all the services you have requested or perform certain functions in relation to you.
Children
NZFC cannot distinguish the age of persons who access and use the Film NZ Websites. If a minor (according to applicable laws) has provided us with Personal Information without parental or guardian consent, the parent or guardian should contact us to remove the Personal Information.
NZFC Products are not intended to be used by children under the age of 16 and children under the age of 16 are not permitted to sign up for a Member Account.
If we discover that a child under the age of 16 has a Member Account we will take steps to terminate the Member Account and delete that child’s personal information.

You authorise us to disclose any information about you to law enforcement or government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe is necessary or appropriate.

Security of your personal information
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect.
NZFC and our third party providers store personal information in a secure environment accessed only by authorised persons.  We use generally accepted security standards to protect personal information collected from you from misuse and loss and from unauthorised access, modification and disclosure.
NZFC also maintains internal privacy procedures to ensure its staff handle personal information in an appropriate way.
Given the nature of the internet we cannot guarantee security of information transmitted through the internet.  We will do our best to protect your personal data, however any transmission is at your own risk.

EU Data Subject Rights
If you are an EU resident, you may have certain rights in relation to the personal information we hold about you. We set out these rights and how to exercise them below. Some of these rights only apply in certain circumstances.
These rights include:
access;
correction;
erasure;
restriction of processing; and
data portability.
How to exercise your rights
Please note that we will require you to provide us with proof of identity before responding to any requests to exercise your rights. We must respond to a request by you to exercise those rights without undue delay and at least within one month (although this may be extended by a further two months in certain circumstances). To exercise any of your rights, please send the following details to businessaffairs@nzfilm.co.nz:
proof of identity (one of the following: passport, driving licence, national identity card or birth certificate. The documents must include your full name and date of birth, nationality, and include proof of any name change). If you are exercising rights on behalf of another EU resident (the data subject), please include both your proof of identity and the proof of identity of the data subject. You will also need a signed consent from the data subject, authorising you to exercise these rights on their behalf. If the data subject is a minor, you will not need signed consent, but will require proof of your status as the data subject’s parent or guardian;
contact details;
details of country of residence;
details of the data right(s) you wish to exercise, including any relevant details; and
confirmation that you understand that NZFC may require further details from you in order to confirm your identity and/or process your request.
Please note, if you make a request in relation to your data rights and we do not hold information in a form that allows us to identify you, we will inform you of that. We will not be obliged to comply with those data rights unless you provide additional information that allows us to identify what information we hold about you. If we do not take action on your request in relation to your data subject rights, we will advise you within one month of the reasons we will not be taking action. You may make a complaint to us or to your data protection authority, and you may seek a judicial remedy in accordance with the provisions of the GDPR.
We will communicate any correction or erasure of Personal Information or restriction of processing that we undertake in accordance with your instructions to any third parties who have received that Personal Information, unless that notification is impossible or involves a disproportionate effort. If you request, we will provide you with details of those third parties that have received your Personal Information.
Complaints
In the event that you wish to make a complaint about how we process your Personal Information or respond to any request by you in relation to your data rights, please contact us and we will endeavour to deal with your request as soon as possible. You also have the right to launch a claim with your data protection authority.
Legal basis for using your personal information
The GDPR requires us to tell you the legal basis for processing your personal information.
The principal bases on which we process your personal information are:
consent: Applies where you have freely given an informed, specific and unambiguous indication that we are permitted to collect and process your personal information. At any time, you may revoke your consent to the processing of some or all of your personal information by:
emailing our data protection officer; and
using the “unsubscribe” function in any communication that we send to you.
If you revoke your consent, we may need to stop providing you with products, services, funding or support if consent is the only legal basis for our processing of your personal information. The withdrawal of consent will not affect processing of personal information that occurs before you notify us that you have withdrawn your consent.
contract: Applies if processing your personal information is necessary for the performance of a contract you are a party to. For example:
if we are acting as film income collection agent for you, we will need to store and use your bank account details in order to make payments to you;
if you are a Member, we will need to store and use certain personal information (e.g. your credit card details) to enable you to purchase and access NZ Film Products.
Access
You have the right to know whether we process personal information about you, and if we do, to access personal information we hold about you and certain information about how we use it and who we share it with.
We may not provide you with certain personal information if providing it would interfere with another’s rights (e.g. where providing the personal information we hold about you would reveal information about another person) or where another exemption applies.
You have the right to one copy of the information set out above. If you request further copies of that information, we may charge a reasonable fee for our administrative costs.
Correction
You have the right to correct any personal information we hold about you that is inaccurate. You may have incomplete Personal Information we hold about you completed, including by means of a supplementary statement (taking into account the purposes of processing of the relevant Personal Information). During the period while we assess whether the Personal Information we hold about you is inaccurate or incomplete, you may exercise your right to restrict our processing of the applicable data as described below.
Erasure
You may request that we erase the personal information we hold about you in the following circumstances:
you believe that it is no longer necessary for us to hold the personal information we hold about you;
we are processing the personal information we hold about you on the basis of your consent, and you wish to withdraw your consent and there is no other ground under which we can process the Personal Information;
you no longer wish us to use the personal information we hold about you in order to send you information about the NZFC and its services; or
you believe the personal information we hold about you is being unlawfully processed by us.
During the period while we consider your request for erasure, you may exercise your right to restrict our processing of the personal information as described below.
Please provide as much detail as possible on your reasons for the request to assist us in determining whether you have a valid basis for erasure. After deleting the Personal Information, we may not be able to provide services to you, or the same level of service that we were previously able to provide.
Where you have requested that we erase personal information that we have made public and there are grounds for erasure, we will use reasonable steps try to tell others that are displaying the personal information or providing links to the personal information to erase that Personal Information.
Restriction of Processing to Storage Only
You have a right to require us to stop processing the personal information we hold about you other than for storage purposes in certain circumstances. Please note, however, that if we stop processing the Personal Information, we may use it again if there are valid grounds under data protection law for us to do so (e.g. for the defence of legal claims or for another individual’s protection).
You may request we stop processing and just store the personal information we hold about you where:
you believe the personal information is not accurate, for the period it takes for us to verify whether the personal information is accurate;
the processing we are doing is unlawful and we wish to erase the Personal Information, but you require us to store the personal information instead; or
the personal information is no longer necessary for our purposes and we wish to erase it, but you require us to store that personal information for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
Portability
You have the right to receive certain parts of the personal information that we collect from you in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and a right to request that we transfer such personal information to another party.
The personal information that you can request under this “portability” right is data that you have provided us with your consent, or that you provided for the purposes of performing our contract with you.
If you wish for us to transfer the personal information to another party, please ensure you provide the details of that party and note that we can only do so where it is technically feasible. We are not responsible for the security of the personal information or its processing once received by the third party. We also may not provide you with certain personal information if providing it would interfere with another individual’s rights, for instance where providing the personal information we hold about you would reveal information about another person.
