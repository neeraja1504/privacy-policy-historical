Privacy
You may browse and access the vast majority of information contained in this website without providing any personal information.
We have software to track which pages are visited, to help us identify the most popular areas of our website. The information is aggregated and we can't identify individual visitors.
Where you voluntarily provide personal information (for example, through email feedback or by completing a form), we’ll use that information only for the purpose for which it was given.
When you subscribe to one of our project update alerts or newsletters, we collect your name and email address. Once subscribed, your details will be added to a mailing list that is used to distribute e-newsletters.
The NZ Transport Agency sometimes uses Campaign Monitor, a dedicated e-newsletter communication tool to easily manage and distribute project news. Campaign Monitor is based in Australia and may use servers based in the United States of America and Europe, and therefore your information may be disclosed or used in such countries. Campaign Monitor will use your information in accordance with its Privacy Policy.(external link)

Unique opens – The number and email addresses of subscribers that have opened the email
Email client usage – which email account (Gmail, Outlook, Hotmail) was used to open the email

Bounced – The number of emails that weren’t successful due to an inactive address, DNS failure, or if the recipient’s mailbox was full
Not opened – The number and email addresses of subscribers that didn’t open the email
Shares – The number of times the newsletter has been shared via email, Facebook or Twitter by subscriber
Most popular links – The most clicks on any links directing to other websites or information not contained in the email.
There is no ability to collect information beyond this, or to track the recipient outside of a specific e-newsletter. Once the recipient has closed the newsletter, no further information can be collected.
The NZ Transport Agency holds a variety of information. When dealing with information, the NZ Transport Agency complies with the relevant information legislation, such as the Official Information Act 1982 and the Privacy Act 1993. Where the information is part of a public register, there are specific laws that require the NZ Transport Agency to grant access to certain parts of that information.
You have the right to request access to and correction of that information.

Call recording privacy statement
The Transport Agency handles thousands of calls every day on a varied range of topics that include driver licensing, road tolling, motor vehicle registration, and the State highway network.  Call recording is an important activity that helps us to ensure that our customer service meets your expectations and identify service improvements.
More about call recording privacy
Vehicle screening and traffic analysis
The Transport Agency is implementing vehicle screening cameras at some Commercial Vehicle Safety Centre (CVSC) locations to assist with the enforcement of weight restrictions for heavy vehicles.  If you are in a heavy vehicle and you drive past one of these cameras details of your vehicle will be collected to help determine whether your vehicle meets relevant weight restrictions.  You may be required to stop at the CVSC if the initial screening indicates your vehicle may not meet weight restrictions.
More about heavy vehicle weight enforcement
If you are not in a heavy vehicle and you drive past one of these cameras, the registration plate number of your vehicle will be captured and retained in secure system logs held by the Transport Agency for the purposes of system fault analysis. Access to system logs is restricted to a small number of authorised Transport Agency personnel only and will only be accessed and used for the purposes of analysing faults occurring in the vehicle screening system.  The registration plate number of your vehicle won’t be used to access any personal information held about you by the Transport Agency.  Anonymised information about your vehicle also may be collected and retained for statistical traffic analysis by the Transport Agency.  Your image won’t be captured, you won’t be identified, and no information that can be linked to you will be collected or held.
Driver has passed away
To assist the Transport Agency with keeping the national driver licence register up-to-date, the Registrar-General of Births, Deaths and Marriages may notify us when a driver has passed away.

Use of your driver licence photo
The photo captured for your driver licence under Part 3 of the Land Transport (Driver Licensing) Rule 1999 may also be used by the Department of Internal Affairs, Department of Corrections, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (Immigration), New Zealand Customs Service, and the New Zealand Police for the purposes of identity verification and law enforcement under section 200 of the Land Transport Act, or for one of the purposes outlined in Part 10A of the Privacy Act. Your photo may therefore be disclosed to one of these agencies, for one of these purposes.
