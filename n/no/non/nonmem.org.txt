Cognigen Corporation - Privacy Statement
Your privacy on the Internet is of the utmost importance to us. Because we gather certain types of information about the users of Cognigen Corporation's web site, we feel you should fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses: (1) what information we gather and (2) how we use it.
1. Information Cognigen gathers and tracks
Cognigen gathers aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying browser types, where you visit us from, and pages viewed throughout our site. Such information enables us to better tailor our content to readers' needs and to better understand the demographics of our audience. With this information, Cognigen tracks user traffic patterns throughout its site. However, Cognigen does not correlate this information with data about individual users. Cognigen does break down overall usage statistics according to a user's domain name, browser type, and MIME type by reading this information from the browser string (information contained in every user's browser). Cognigen does use cookies (small data files that write to your hard drive when you visit them) in gathering such information.
2. Use of the information
Cognigen uses any information collected to enhance your experience in our network, whether to provide interactive or personalized elements on the site or to better prepare future content based on the interests of our users. No information is resold to third parties.
