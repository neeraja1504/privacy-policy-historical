How the Personally Identifiable Information is Used
Personally identifiable information which we collect for a particular purpose will only be saved and used for that purpose, unless you have agreed to allow us to use it for some other purpose, as described in this Privacy Policy.
For the purpose of handling payments, DAO Games has the right to disclose user data to service providers instructed to collect the user fee insofar as this is necessary for the calculation of the fee and for settlement with the user. Furthermore, weare entitled to provide user data to third parties to whom receivables due to us from the user have been assigned provided that this is necessary to collect the receivables. We shall inform the user of the names of such third parties. If we cooperate with third parties in order to provide its services, we shall oblige such parties to comply with applicable data protection laws and to ensure adequate data protection.
We may also use the information provided by or stored on the user purely for internal checks as regards demography, user interests and user behavior. This use is carried out anonymously. We may also statistically evaluate information on the user in an anonymous and aggregated form for advertising and market research. If and as far as we use user data to create user profiles, we shall never pass on such profiles without the prior consent of the user and shall immediately stop such utilization of user profiles if the user at some point objects to such use of his data.
Although we regard your right to privacy of paramount importance, due to legal rules beyond our control, we cannot fully guarantee that your private communications and other personally identifiable information will not be disclosed to third parties. For example, we may be forced to disclose your information to law enforcement or other appropriate third parties in connection with criminal investigations, investigation of fraud, infringement of intellectual property rights, or other suspected illegal activities, or as otherwise may be required by applicable law, or, as we deem necessary in our sole discretion, in order to protect the legitimate legal and business interests of DAO Games.
Privacy Protections for Children
In order to protect the privacy interests of younger Internet users, we do not allow children under the age of 18 to use our services without the consent of their parents or legal guardians. We also provide a number of provisions regarding the personally identifiable information (PII) of children. These are that a parent/guardian has the right to review the information the site has collected from their child, have their child’s PII deleted from the site and also request us to stop collecting further PII from their child in the future.
To request removal of your child’s information, please send us an email (to the address below) and be sure to include in your message the same user name, password, and email address that your child submitted. If your child has used your credit card on our websites without your permission, contact us immediately at support@novaworlds.com.
Security
If you visit any chat room or put messages on a bulletin board you should be aware that you are disclosing information to anyone who might happen to be in the chat room or visiting the bulletin board. This means that others can get hold of any information that you give in these areas and you may get messages from people who you don't know.
You are responsible for your information on the Internet. Make sure that you are careful when you visit our site in a public place like an Internet cafe. DAO Games can only be responsible for your information when it is received on our own computers and not whilst it is in any intermediate environment.
Third Parties & Advertisers
Generally we do not give your information to other third parties unless you let us. However, given that we partner with a number of external payment service provider companies to enable you to make payment via a wide range of payment options, we share your billing information with such companies insofar as is necessary for the processing of your payment or to prevent or detect fraud.
We never disclose information to advertisers. What we do is show you the advertisements of advertisers you might be most interested in bearing in mind what we know about you from your registration information. We do not give any information to advertiser themselves so they will never know about you personally.
We do give advertisers information where you are not identified, such as how many people have clicked on their advertisements, what age range those people are and whether they are male or female. This may also include information about their particular interests; however they will never know who these people are.
