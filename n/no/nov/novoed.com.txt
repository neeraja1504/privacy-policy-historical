Cookies are small text files that are downloaded by the browser that you use to reach and use our service. These cookies collect, store, and share data of your activities across websites.

We use both session-based and persistent cookies. Here’s what they are:
Session cookies are temporary and last only while your browser is open. They are deleted from your device when you leave the service.
Persistent cookies remain in your browser or device for a much longer time mostly until your browser deletes them or when they reach their expiry date, depending on the cookie. They are unique and allow us to perform site analytics and customization, among other similar things.
Cookies may be set by either the site that you are visiting (‘first party cookies’) or by third parties, such as those who use our services (‘third party cookies’). More information on cookies can be found at www.aboutcookies.org.
