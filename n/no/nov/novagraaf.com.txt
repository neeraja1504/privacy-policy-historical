5. Your rights
Under Regulation (EU) No 2016/679 of 27 April 2016, from the time it comes into force on 25 May 2018, you will have rights of access, amendment, opposition and erasure over information about you, and the right to know and receive that information. You can exercise your rights by emailing info@novagraaf.com or writing to
Novagraaf Nederland B.V.
PO Box 22722 1100 DE AMSTERDAM
specifying in the subject line of the email or letter "Personal rights" and enclosing a copy of your identity document. You can also object to your data being processed and to your data being used for marketing purposes.
NOVAGRAAF undertakes to respond as soon as possible, and in any event within one month from receiving your request.
When necessary, that period may be extended by two months, having regard for the number and complexity of requests sent to NOVAGRAAF. Where that occurs, you will be informed of that extension and the reasons for it.
If NOVAGRAAF does not act on your request, it will inform you of the reasons for doing nothing and you will be entitled to make a complaint to a supervisory authority and/or to bring court proceedings.
Right to information about the processing of your personal data
NOVAGRAAF endeavours to provide you with concise, comprehensible and easily accessible information in clear and simple terms about how your personal data are processed.
Right of access, rectification and erasure of your personal data
The right of access enables you to obtain confirmation from NOVAGRAAF that your personal data are or are not processed, and where they are, to access them or obtain a copy of them.
You are also entitled to have NOVAGRAAF rectify your personal data, within 30 days.
Lastly, subject to the exceptions under the applicable law (e.g. retention of data necessary to comply with a legal obligation), you are entitled to request NOVAGRAAF to erase your personal data as soon as possible, where one of the following grounds applies:
Your personal data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed;
You wish to withdraw your consent where that consent was the basis for processing your personal data when there is no other basis justifying that processing;
You believe and are able to show that your personal data have been processed unlawfully;
Your personal data must be erased pursuant to a legal obligation.
Right to personal data portability
Where processing is based on your consent or on a contract, the portability right enables you to receive the personal data you have provided to NOVAGRAAF in a structured, commonly used format and to transmit those data to another controller without hindrance from NOVAGRAAF.
Where it is technically possible to do so, you can request that those personal data be transmitted directly by NOVAGRAAF to another data controller.
Right to withdraw consent to the processing of personal data
Where NOVAGRAAF processes your personal data on the basis of your consent, you can withdraw that consent at any time using the means made available to you for that purpose. Under the applicable law, however, withdrawing your consent is not retrospective and cannot therefore affect the lawfulness of processing carried out before the withdrawal.
Right to make a complaint to a supervisory authority
​​​​​​​ If, notwithstanding NOVAGRAAF's efforts to keep your personal data confidential, you believe that your rights have not been complied with, you have a right to make a complaint to a supervisory authority. You can find a list of supervisory authorities on the European Commission's website.
