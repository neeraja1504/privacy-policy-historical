The quick version (summary)
Really you should read this whole thing, but I also know your time is valuable, so here’s a summary of the important bits:
If you sign up for my email list, of course I’ll be saving your email so I can contact you. If you make a purchase then I need to store your purchase details like billing address. Card details are not stored on my site—they are sent to a third party payment processor (SagePay / Stripe / PayPal). If you submit any forms on my site, such as comment or contact forms, then a copy is saved on my server.
Your details are only shared with relevant, trusted third parties, such as my payment processors and help desk software.
If you want to request a copy of your data or request erasure, contact support@nosegraze.com.
