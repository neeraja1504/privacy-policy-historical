What information NORML gathers about you
Web Traffic Monitoring
NORML keeps track of non-personally identifiable information such as the IP address of the user's computer, time of access, browser type and files downloaded to gather usage statistics for its web site. IP addresses are not associated with other information about a user, but only indicate general visitor navigation patterns. This is typically done by most websites.
Additionally, though NORML is primarily funded by individual donors, in order for NORML to successfully meet its organizational goals through other fund raising sources the NORML's website has embedded tags that allow some third party entities such as Quantcast and Google Analytics to collect non-personally identifiable usage statistics.
NORML does not collect personal information through our website other than what is supplied to us on a voluntary basis.
