Privacy & Cookie Policy
(a) Rely on your explicit consent  for the collection, processing and disclosure of the above Special Categories of Personal Data on behalf of each Student you are responsible for; or
(b) Where a Student you are responsible for is capable of providing consent with respect to the processing of his/her personal data, rely on his or her explicit consent to our collection, processing and disclosure of the above Special Categories of Personal Data.
We may obtain Personal Data from you (or any Student you are responsible for) directly, or from third parties such as other educational or sporting institutions, credit reference and anti-fraud agencies, sanctions and politically exposed persons screening lists, our business partners and public registers.
Security over the internet
No data transmission over the Internet or through a website can be guaranteed to be secure from intrusion. However, we maintain commercially reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your Personal Data, and that of any Student you are responsible for, in accordance with data protection legislative requirements.
All information you, or any Student you are responsible for, provide to us is stored on our or our suppliers’ secure servers and accessed and used subject to our security policies and standards. We ask that you, or any Student you are responsible for:
(a) Refrain from sharing any password providing access to certain parts of our websites, applications or systems with any other person; and
(b) Comply with any other security procedures that we may notify you of from time to time.
Export outside the EEA
Your Personal Data, or that of any Student you are responsible for, may be transferred to, stored in or accessed by staff or suppliers in, a destination outside the European Economic Area (EEA). Regardless of location, we will impose the same data protection safeguards that we deploy inside the EEA.
Certain countries outside the EEA have been approved by the European Commission as providing essentially equivalent protections to EEA data protection laws and therefore no additional safeguards are required to export Personal Data to these jurisdictions. In countries which have not had these approvals, (see the full list here http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/adequacy/index_en.htm) we will transfer it subject to European Commission approved contractual terms that impose equivalent data protection obligations directly on the recipient unless we are permitted under applicable data protection law to make such transfers without such formalities.
Please contact us if you would like to see a copy of the specific safeguards applied to the export of Personal Data relating to you or any Student you are responsible for.
Storage limits
We will Personal Data for as long as is necessary for the processing purpose(s) for which they were collected and any other permitted linked purpose (for example certain transaction details and correspondence may be retained until the time limit for claims in respect of the transaction has expired or in order to comply with regulatory requirements regarding the retention of such data). So if Personal Data is used for two purposes we will retain it until the purpose with the latest period expires; but we will stop using it for the purpose with a shorter period one that period expires. We restrict access to Personal Data to those persons who need to use it for the relevant purpose(s).
Our retention periods are based on business needs and relevant laws. Records that are no longer needed are either irreversibly anonymised (and the anonymised information may be retained) or securely destroyed.
Your Personal Data obtained on the basis of the above consent will be processed during the term of the contractual relationship between you / Student and NAE and three years after its termination, or until revocation of the given consent.
