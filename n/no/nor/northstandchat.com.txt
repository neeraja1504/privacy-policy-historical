11. Does our privacy policy apply to external links?
Our website and forum posts by members may contain links to other websites. However, once you have used these links to leave our site, you should note that we do not have any control over that other website. Therefore, we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which you provide whilst visiting such sites and such sites are not governed by this privacy statement. You should exercise caution and look at the privacy statement applicable to the website in question.
12. How do we handle personal messages (PM's) on our forums?
Personal messages sent via North Stand Chat are stored in our database. A limited number of personnel have access to this database and it is possible that your messages could be read by those personnel. North Stand Chat administrators do not routinely read personal messages, but it may become necessary to do sowhen abuse has been reported or suspected. The database will from time to time be scanned for key words and phrases that break our terms of service. With that in mind, North Stand Chat recommend that you do not use our PM system to transmit personal messages that you do not want anyone else to access.
13. How do we handle any personal data in posts on the DIBB public forum?
Due to the real-time nature of North Stand Chat, it is impossible for North Stand Chat staff to review messages or confirm the validity of information posted.
If you provide personal information in a post, that personal information will be publicly posted and otherwise disclosed without limitation as to its use by us or by a third party.
You are in control of your own posts and can edit and delete the posts you make in an open thread at any time. If the thread is locked, you will need to report your own post and ask admin to delete it for you.
14. How do we secure data?
We take steps to ensure your personal data is treated securely.
We regularly review our security procedures to consider appropriate new technology and methods. Please be aware that, despite our best efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.
Any password you enter is also stored in an encrypted form. We cannot read/decode/decipher that password. If you forget your password, it can only be reset by generating a new password.
15. Do we use automated decision making?
Our software checks the registration IP address to make sure it has not previously been used to post forum spam. New registrations will then be manually checked by a member of staff before approval.
