WEB BROWSER COOKIES AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES USED TO COLLECT INFORMATION
In addition to the collection of information described above, we use various technologies to collect information from your computer and about your activities on the ICON Sites.
Cookies. When you visit an ICON Site, we may assign your computer one or more cookies, to facilitate access to such ICON Site and to personalize your experience on that ICON Site. A cookie is a small text file, with no Personally Identifiable Information, that we place on User’s computer browser. Through the use of a cookie, we also may automatically collect information about your online activity on an ICON Site, such as the web pages you visit and the links you click. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies. If you choose to decline cookies, please note that you may not be able to sign in or use some of the interactive features offered on the ICON Sites.
Other technologies. We may use standard Internet technology, such as web beacons and other similar technologies, to track your use of the ICON Sites. Web beacons are tiny graphics which are embedded in the webpage and are used for similar purposes as cookies to track activity. We also may include web beacons in e-mail messages or newsletters to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon. The information we obtain in this manner enables us to customize the services we offer to visitors of the ICON Sites, to deliver targeted advertisements, and to measure the overall effectiveness of our online advertising, content, programming or other activities.
Information collected by third-parties. We may allow third-parties, including our authorized service providers, advertising companies, and ad networks, to display advertisements on the ICON Sites. These companies may use tracking technologies, such as cookies, to collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements. The ICON Sites do not provide any personal information to these third-parties. This information allows them to deliver targeted advertisements and gauge their effectiveness.
HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION
We adopt appropriate data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction of your personal information, username, password, transaction information and data stored on the ICON Sites.
Sensitive and private data exchange between an ICON Site and a User happens over a SSL secured communication channel and is encrypted and protected with digital signatures.
We want you to feel confident using the ICON Sites. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure email. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission’s website at http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.
DELETING YOUR INFORMATION
If you have cancelled your account with an Icon Site or Icon Service, and wish to delete your account information, please contact us at (866) 608-1798 during regular business hours. If we delete your account, your user profile will no longer be visible and all information associated with your account will be permanently deleted. We may retain and use your information to comply with applicable law, resolve disputes, or enforce our agreements. You may still receive promotional emails from us regarding new Icon Products or Icon Services.
THIRD PARTY WEBSITES
Users may find advertising or other content on the ICON Sites that link to the sites and services of our partners, suppliers, advertisers, sponsors, licensors and other third parties. We do not control the content or links that appear on these sites and are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from the ICON Sites. In addition, these sites or services, including their content and links, may be constantly changing. These sites and services may have their own privacy policies and customer service policies. Browsing and interaction on any other website, including websites which have a link to an ICON Site, is subject to that website’s own terms and policies.
ADVERTISING DISCLAIMER
We share no affiliation with any political party or its views. Our ads visible on political websites are there as a result of remarketing, not a partnership, affiliation, or endorsement.
Remarketing lets us show ads to people who have visited the ICON Sites. When people leave an ICON Site without buying anything, remarketing helps us reconnect with them by showing relevant ads across their different devices and websites. The ads simply follow the user to the sites they visit.
CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY
We reserve the right to update and change this Privacy Policy at any time without notice to you.
We encourage Users to frequently check this page for any changes to stay informed about how we are helping to protect the personal information we collect. You acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to review this Privacy Policy periodically and become aware of modifications.
YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS
By using an ICON Site, you signify your acceptance of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not use the ICON Sites. Your continued use of an ICON Site following the posting of changes to this policy will be deemed your acceptance of those changes.
CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS

Shipping Policy
All non-UPS shipments require a customer signature upon delivery. The shipping company will call before attempting to deliver your machine. A total of three attempts will be made to contact you. After three attempts have been made the shipping company will make arrangements to return your machine to our warehouse. Return shipping and a 10% restocking fee may apply.
We cannot ship to P.O. or APO Boxes with internet orders. There are a couple of reasons for this. One is that many of our items are large and ship in boxes bigger than the post office will accept for postal boxes. Our on-line order system can’t determine what size of box your order will ship in. Another reason is that we ship items, like treadmill lubricant, that cannot be shipped through the US postal service.
Return Policy
We give a 30-day trial period on all products. If you receive a defective machine we will be happy to send a replacement machine. Returns for defective and non-defective products must be arranged within 30 days of receiving the product. If you are not satisfied for any reason please call 1-866-896-9777 to set up a return. Upon receiving a Return Authorization number, put your machine back in the box and take it to your curb to be picked up. We will send a freight carrier to pick up your machine. If you receive a defective machine you will receive a replacement machine. If you were not charged for shipping on your initial delivery you will only be charged for the return shipping fee. A 10% restocking fee is also charged on all returned or canceled merchandise (unless the merchandise is defective). If your product(s) has shipped (even if you have not received your machine) return shipping and restocking fees will apply.
