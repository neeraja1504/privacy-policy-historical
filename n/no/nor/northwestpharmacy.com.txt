The Types of Personal Information We Collect
To order from this website, we request certain personal information from you on the registration form. During registration and account creation, you are required to provide your contact information (such as name, address, phone number and email address) and you are also required to create a password. We use this information to contact you about the services on our site in which you have expressed interest.
Once you have created an account, you are then able to order prescription drugs as well as over the counter drugs. For orders for over the counter drugs, we request no additional information other than that which has been provided during the registration and account creation process as mentioned above. To order prescription medications, we will require additional medical information about the patient (which may be you or a family member) for whom the prescription has been ordered. This information includes: name, height, weight, date of birth, gender, the existence and types of drug allergies, medications requested, medical history information, details of your existing medications, prescription information, and the name of your primary physician and his or her contact information.
The choice to provide us with personal information is always yours. However, your decision to withhold particular details may limit the products and services we are able to provide and makes it more difficult for us to advise you or suggest appropriate alternatives. If we are unable to accommodate your request based on the information that has been provided, we may ask for additional details in order to serve you best. We may also maintain a file containing contact history that is used for customer inquiry purposes. We may collect anonymous/non-personal information. Anonymous/non-personal information is information that cannot be associated with or traced back to a specific individual or business entity.
The Purposes for Which We Use Personal Information
We use your or your family members' personal information to communicate with you, send you newsletters, enhance your visit to our site, process orders, and effectively provide the products and services you have requested. We may provide your or your family members personal information to a licensed physician to review and approve your prescription. We may use personal information to send you notices and special offers via email. You may opt out of these emails at any time by clicking the "unsubscribe" link in these email notices/offers.
We will not furnish personal information to an outside organization for its use in marketing or solicitation without your prior consent.
We use personal information only for the purposes that we have disclosed to you. If for any reason your information is required to further a different purpose, we will notify you and ask you for your consent before we proceed. Only the information specifically requested is disclosed and we will take precautions to satisfy ourselves that the authorities who make the request have legitimate grounds to do so. We may disclose personal information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our website, if necessary, in certain limited circumstances such as a medical emergency, suspicion of illegal activity, or to collect on a delinquent account. We sometimes contract outside organizations to perform specialized services. Our trusted service suppliers may at times be responsible for processing and handling some of the information we receive from you. When you visit our website, information is not collected that could identify you personally unless you choose to provide it voluntarily.
