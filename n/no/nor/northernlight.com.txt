Third Party Partners and Integrations
The Site may contain links to third party the Sites or services, such as third party integrations, co-branded services, or third party-branded services (“Third Party Partners”).  Northern Light does not own or control these Third Party Partners and when you interact with them, you may be providing information directly to the Third Party Partner, Northern Light, or both.

Your Rights
You may exercise any of the rights described in this section by sending an email to privacy@NorthernLight.com. Please note that we may ask you to verify your identity before taking further action on your request.
Managing Your Information.  If you have created an Account, you may access and update some of your information through your Account settings. You are responsible for keeping your personal information up-to-date.
Rectification of Inaccurate or Incomplete Information.  You have the right to ask us to correct inaccurate or incomplete personal information concerning you (and which you cannot update yourself within your account).
Data Access and Portability. In some jurisdictions, applicable law may entitle you to request copies of your personal information held by us. You may also be entitled to request copies of personal information that you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and/or request us to transmit this information to another service provider (where technically feasible).
Data Retention and Erasure.  We generally retain your personal information for as long as is necessary for the performance services we provide you from the Site to comply with our legal obligations.  We may store your personal information for longer periods for our own purposes including improving the performance of the Site and other items described above.  If you no longer want us to use your information to provide the Site, you can request that we erase your personal information and close your account. Please note that if you request the erasure of your personal information:
We may retain some of your personal information as necessary for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud detection and prevention and enhancing safety. For example, if we suspend an account for fraud or safety reasons, we may retain certain information from that account to prevent that user or customer from opening a new account in the future.
We may retain and use your personal information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations. For example, Northern Light may keep some of your information for tax, legal reporting and auditing obligations.
Information you have shared with others (e.g., forum postings) may continue to be publicly visible on the Site, even after your account is cancelled. However, attribution of such information to you will be removed. Additionally, some copies of your information (e.g., log records) may remain in our database, but are disassociated from personal identifiers.
Because we maintain redundant copies of the Site to protect from accidental or malicious loss and destruction, residual copies of your personal information may not be removed from our backup systems for a limited period of time.
Withdrawing Consent and Restriction of Processing.  Where you have expressly provided your consent to the processing of your personal information by Northern Light you may withdraw your consent at any time by deleting your Account settings or by sending a communication to Northern Light specifying which consent you are withdrawing. Please note that the withdrawal of your consent does not affect the lawfulness of any processing activities based on such consent before its withdrawal. Additionally, in some jurisdictions, applicable law may give you the right to limit the ways in which we use your personal information, in particular where (i) you contest the accuracy of your personal information; (ii) the processing is unlawful and you oppose the erasure of your personal information; (iii) we no longer need your personal information for the purposes of the processing, but you require the information for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; or (iv) you have objected to the processing pursuant to Section 5.6 and pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of Northern Light override your own.
Objection to Processing.  In some jurisdictions, applicable law may permit you to legally object to Northern Light’s processing. In these instances, you may require Northern Light not to process your personal information for specific purposes even where such processing is based on legitimate interest. If you object to such processing Northern Light will no longer process your personal information for these purposes unless we can demonstrate a legal basis for doing so or such processing is required for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims. At any time, regardless of applicable law, you may object to us processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes. You may, at any time, ask Northern Light to cease processing your data for these direct marketing purposes by sending an e-mail to privacy@NorthernLight.com.
Lodging Complaints.  With respect to GDPR, you have the right to submit complaints about the data processing activities carried out by Northern Light before the appropriate commission in your jurisdiction.  Please seek your own legal counsel or appropriate government agency for instructions.  For complaints unrelated to GDPR, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit your right to file a complaint in the appropriate jurisdiction.
In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Northern Light commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal information.  EU individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield policy should first contact Northern Light at:

Where we transfer, store, and process your personal information outside of the EEA we have ensured that appropriate safeguards are in place to ensure an adequate level of data protection.

This agreement may incorporate the basis of the EU Model Clauses (a set of clauses issued by the European Commission).
California Privacy Rights.  California law permits users and customers who are California residents to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, a list of the third parties to whom we have disclosed their personal information (if any) for their direct marketing purposes in the prior calendar year, as well as the type of personal information disclosed to those third parties. See the “Contact Us” section for where to send such requests. Northern Light does not share personal information with third parties for its own direct marketing purposes without your prior consent. Accordingly, you can prevent disclosure of your personal information to third parties for direct marketing purposes by withholding consent.
