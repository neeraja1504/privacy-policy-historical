Hello, Nomsters! This is our Privacy Policy effective as of November 6, 2018—read it!
Nom Nom Paleo LLC, the owner of nomnompaleo.com (the “Site”) is committed to your privacy. This Privacy Policy tells you what information we collect from you from this Site, and how we use and disclose it.
COOKIES
Cookies are not Paleo, but we do use them on this Site! The “cookie” I’m talking about is a file that contains an identifier—a string of letters and numbers—sent by a web server to a web browser and stored by the browser. This cookie is then sent back to the server every time the browser requests a page from the server. Cookies may be either “persistent” cookies or “session” cookies. A persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user beforehand. A session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, as soon as the web browser is closed. Cookies do not typically contain any information that personally identifies a user, but personal information that we store about you may be linked to the information stored in and obtained from cookies.
We use cookies for the following purposes:
(a) Authentication: We use cookies to identify you when you visit our website and as you navigate our website;
(b) Email: We use cookies to help us to send relevant emails to users who have subscribed to our email list;
