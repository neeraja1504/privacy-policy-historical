Noom also collects data about User, including about User’s make-up, fitness level, health indicators, and related information that does not identify User and that enables User to fully participate in the Service.
Information Noom Collects or Stores as User Accesses and Uses the Website and Service
In addition to any Personal Information or other information that User choose to submit to Noom via Noom’s Website, Noom and Noom’s third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies that automatically (or passively) store or collect certain information whenever User visits or interacts with the Website (“ Usage Information ”). This Usage Information may be stored or accessed using a variety of technologies that may be downloaded to User’s personal computer, browser, laptop, tablet, mobile phone or other device (a “ Device ”) whenever User visits or interacts with Noom’s Website and/or the Mobiel App. To the extent Noom associates Usage Information with User’s Personal Information Noom collects directly from User on the Website, Noom will treat it as Personal Information.
This Usage Information may include:
• User’s IP address, UDID or other unique identifier (“ Device Identifier ”). A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to User’s Device used to access the Website, and Noom’s computers identify User’s Device by its Device Identifier;
• User’s Device functionality (including browser, operating system, hardware, mobile network information);
• User’s subscription level;

A Flash cookie (or locally shared object) is a data file placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by User to User’s Device. HTML5 cookies can be programmed through HTML5 local storage. Unlike Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies do not require a plug-in. Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools that are available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some but not all instances can be blocked in the future by selecting certain settings. Each browser User uses will need to be set separately and different browsers offer different functionality and options in this regard. Also, these tools may not be effective with regard to Flash cookies or HTML5 cookies. For information on disabling Flash cookies go to Adobe’s web site www.adobe.com. Please be aware that if User disables or removes cookies, Flash cookies, or HTML5 cookies on User’s Device, some parts of Noom’s Website, Mobile App and/or Services may not function properly, and that when User revisits Noom’s Website, Mobile App and Services User’s ability to limit cookies is subject to User’s browser settings and limitations.
• Web Beacons. Small graphic images or other web programming code called “web beacons” (also known as “1×1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”) may be included in pages and messages of our Website, Mobile App and Services. Web beacons may be invisible to User, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a page or e-mail can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Website, Mobile App and Services, to monitor how users navigate the Website, Mobile App and Services, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.
• Embedded Scripts. An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about User’s interactions with the Website, Mobile App and Services, such as the links User clicks on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto User’s Device from Noom’s web server and/or Mobile App or a third party service provider, is active only while User is connected to the Website and/or Mobile App, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.
• ETag, or entity tag. A feature of the cache in browsers. It is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL. If the resource content at that URL ever changes, a new and different ETag is assigned. Used in this manner ETags are a form of Device Identifier. ETag tracking may generate unique tracking values even where the consumer blocks HTTP, Flash, and/or HTML5 cookies.
Noom may use Tracking Technologies for a variety of purposes, including:
• Strictly Necessary. Noom may use cookies or other Tracking Technologies that Noom considers is strictly necessary to allow User to use and access Noom’s Website, Mobile App and Services, including cookies required for system administration, to prevent fraudulent activity, or to improve.
• Performance Related. Noom may use cookies or other Tracking Technologies that are useful in order to assess the performance of the Website, Mobile App and Services, including as part of Noom’s analytic practices or otherwise to improve the content, products or services offered through the Website, Mobile App and Services.

Noom may use cookies or other Tracking Technologies that are required to offer User enhanced functionality when accessing the Website, including identifying User when User sign in to Noom’s Website or keeping track of User’s specified preferences, including in terms of the presentation of content on Noom’s Website.
Noom obtains User’s consent to Noom’s information storage or collection Tracking Technologies by providing User with transparent information in Noom’s Privacy Policy and providing User with the opportunity to make a choice to disable cookies as set forth above. Please note that Noom is not required to obtain User’s consent to the information collection Tracking Technologies identified above that is strictly necessary. User has the right to object to other use of information storage or collection technologies.
There may be other Tracking Technologies now and later devised and used by Noom in connection with the Website, Mobile App and Services. Further, third parties may use Tracking Technologies with Noom’s Website. Noom does not control those Tracking Technologies and Noom is not responsible for them. However, User consents to potentially encountering third party Tracking Technologies in connection with use of Noom’s Website, Mobile App and Services and accepts that Noom’s statements under this Privacy Policy do not apply to the Tracking Technologies or practices of such third parties. User should check the third party websites to confirm how User’s information is collected and used.
Various third parties are developing or have developed signals or other mechanisms for the expression of consumer choice regarding the collection of information about an individual consumer’s online activities over time and across third-party web sites or online services (e.g., browser do not track signals). Currently, Noom does not monitor or take any action with respect to these signals or other mechanisms.
Information Third Parties Provide About User
Noom may, from time to time, supplement the information Noom collects directly from User at the Website, Mobile App and through Services with outside records from third parties for various purposes, including to enhance Noom’s ability to serve User, to tailor Noom’s content to User and to offer User opportunities that may be of interest to User. To the extent Noom combines any non-personally identifiable information Noom receives from those sources with User’s Personal Information Noom collect on the Website, Mobile App and Services, it will be treated as Personal Information and Noom will apply this Privacy Policy to such combined information, unless Noom has disclosed otherwise.
Interactions with Third-Party Websites
The Website, Mobile App and Services may include functionality that allows certain kinds of interactions between the Website, Mobile App and Services and User’s account on a third-party web site or application. The use of this functionality may involve the third-party operator providing certain information, including Personal Information, to Noom. For example, when User registers with the Website and/or Mobile App, User may have an option to use User’s Facebook, Google or other account provided by a third-party site or application to facilitate the registration and log-in or transaction process on the Website, Mobile App and Services or otherwise link accounts. If Noom offers and User chooses to use this functionality to access Noom’s Website, Mobile App and Services, the third-party site or application may send Personal Information about User to the Website and/or Mobile App. If so, Noom will then treat it as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy, since Noom is collecting it as a result of User’s accessing of and interaction on Noom’s Website, Mobile App and Services. In addition, Noom may provide third-party sites’ interfaces or links on the Website, Mobile App and Services to facilitate User’s sending a communication from the Website, Mobile App and Services. For example, Noom may use third parties to facilitate emails, text messages, blog postings, tweets or Facebook postings. These third parties may retain any information used or provided in any such communications or other activities and these third parties’ practices are not subject to Noom’s Privacy Policy. Noom may not control or have access to User’s communications through these third parties. Further, when User use third-party sites or services, User is using their services and not Noom’s services and they, not Noom, are responsible for their practices. User should review the applicable third-party privacy policies before using such third-party tools on Noom’s Website.
How Noom Uses the Personal Information
Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy or as specifically agreed to by User, Noom will not disclose any information Noom gathers from User on Noom’s Website, Mobile App and Services. Noom does not share User’s Personal Information with third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Noom may provide to third parties information about User that does not allow User to be identified or contacted, including where such information is combined with similar information of other users of Noom’s Website, Mobile App and Services. For example, Noom might inform third parties regarding the number of unique users who visit and/or use Noom’s Services, the demographic breakdown of the registered users of Noom’s Services, or the activities that users engage in while on Noom’s Website and/or Mobile App.
In connection with the Business Premium Services, the Business Customer may disclose certain Personal Information to Noom. To the extent that Noom collects and processes Personal Information supplied by the Business Customer, Noom is considered to be the data controller for the purposes of European data protection legislation and Noom will process User’s Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Noom may use User’s information that Noom collects about User:

For example, sometimes a third party may have access to User’s Personal Information in order to support Noom’s information technology or to handle mailings on Noom’s behalf. If Noom transfers User’s Personal Information to an outside agent or organization for such purpose, Noom will take appropriate measures in an effort to protect User’s privacy and the Personal Information Noom transfer.

Profiles. A User’s profile page may be, by default, set up to display information such as the User’s display name, images, location (city/state/country), groups that the User has joined and optional information added by User. Profile information is used by Noom primarily to be presented back to and edited by User when User accesses the Service and to be presented to others permitted to view that information on the Service.
