You have consented to us using your credit report and personal information you have entered into the Website for such purposes as are necessary for us to provide the Services.
In addition, unless you have opted out we will also provide your personal information (but not your credit report or the Confidence Rating) to our group companies and selected third parties for the purposes of marketing including bringing other suitable products and offers to your attention.
If you wish to change your consent at any time please contact us at contact@noddle.co.uk
What personal information do we collect?
We collect personal information in several ways from different parts of the Website. Any personal information we collect will be used by us strictly in accordance with current data protection legislation and this Privacy Policy. We will store the information we collect from you and hold it electronically or otherwise.
Why do we collect your personal information?
We collect personal information from you for the following reasons:
Verifying your identity:
We will collect information which will help us to verify your identity, such as email addresses, usernames and passwords, along with other personal information we will need in order to provide you with a copy of your credit file. This will include, for example, your name, date of birth, your residential address and postcode. This information will be checked against external databases, such as the electoral roll and your credit file, to which we have access for this purpose. We will collect and store a record of the check as well as any additional information you provide, including (but not limited to) aliases, previous addresses and financial associations. This information may be disclosed to authorised third parties through our credit referencing, fraud prevention, risk assessment and identification products.
Occasionally we may ask you to provide documentation for the purpose of verifying your identity, such as utility bills or bank statements. This information will only be requested when we need to verify your current address and we will protect the privacy of such personal information. We store such documentation securely, and it will be destroyed once verification is complete.
If false or inaccurate information is provided and fraud is identified, details will be passed to fraud prevention agencies to prevent fraud and money laundering. Law enforcement agencies may also access and use this information. We and other organisations may also access and use this information to prevent fraud and money laundering, for example when: checking details on applications for credit and credit-related or other facilities; managing credit and credit-related accounts or facilities; recovering debt; checking details on proposals and claims for all types of insurance; checking details of job applicants and employees. Please email us at contact@noddle.co.uk if you want to receive details of the relevant fraud prevention agencies. We and other organisations may access and use from other countries the information recorded by fraud prevention agencies.
Further details explaining how the information held by fraud prevention agencies may be used can be obtained by emailing us at  contact@noddle.co.uk.
Processing your requests:
As part of the Credit Report Services we will obtain electronic copies of your credit reference file from Callcredit Limited and this will be stored in a private area accessible by you as part of this service.
Any e-mail or mobile telephone numbers provided to us will be recorded and used to communicate with you in connection with the Credit Report Services or queries concerning the data held within the credit reports. This information may be disclosed to authorised third parties through our credit referencing, fraud prevention, risk assessment and identification products.
Confidence Rating Services:
Noddle uses a third party supplier (the identity of which may change from time to time at Noddle’s discretion) to help it generate your Confidence Rating Service. The third party supplier acts as a data processor in accordance with instructions from Noddle.
By requesting provision of the Confidence Rating Service, you consent to Noddle providing the third party with information that you have entered into the Noddle website, together with a copy of your credit file. The third party will process this information in accordance with instructions given by Noddle for the sole purpose of generating your Confidence Rating.
The third party will (in conjunction with third party credit providers and information provided by them) analyse key elements of your credit file, in order to determine your current financial standing. The analysis of your credit file will be used by the third party to identify and rank product offers in order of appropriateness for your circumstances (but this does not necessarily guarantee that there will be appropriate product offers available to you). You will then have the opportunity to apply for the product directly with the third party credit provider should you choose to do so.
If you choose to proceed to apply for a product from the ranked list of offers, the supplier you choose will carry out its own identification and credit checks as part of its ordinary application process.
Please note your credit file will not be provided to any third party credit provider at any point during this process (unless you subsequently agree to this).
Signing up to Noddle and procuring and regularly updating your Confidence Rating will not have an adverse impact on your credit standing.
Please note that the provision of your information, including the credit report, to the third party is subject to the Noddle Terms and Conditions (“Terms and Conditions”).
