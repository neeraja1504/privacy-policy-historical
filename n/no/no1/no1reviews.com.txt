No1Reviews.com: Privacy Policy
At No1Reviews.com, we take your privacy seriously. We will never sell or disseminate any personal information about you or your business.
Our privacy policy is outlined in full below...
No1Reviews.com will not collect any personal identifiable information from you unless you voluntarily submit such information, e.g. by signing up to our newsletter.
In common with many other websites, No1Reviews.com does collect non-personally identifiable information for use in generating statistical data in order to help us market our recommended products more effectively.
When signing up to our newsletter/ecourse we will collect your name, e-mail address and any other preferences or personal information that you voluntarily submit to us. This information is used to send you our newsletter/ecourse and from time to time we may use this information to send you details of any special offers we may be promoting that we think you may be interested in.
Our newsletters operate a double opt-in policy, meaning that in order to receive e-mails from us, you must first enter your name and e-mail address on the subscription form on our website (usually located in the menu bar), and then you must confirm your subscription to our newsletter by clicking on a confirmation link that we send you. Only then will you be added to our mailing list. This prevents anyone else from maliciously adding your e-mail address to our mailing list. This double opt-in system is in compliance with current CAN SPAM laws and ensures that you will only receive mail from us if you yourself subscribe and confirm your subscription to our newsletter.
Each and every e-mail you receive from us will have an opt-out link at the bottom, should you wish to unsubscribe from any of our newsletters. This is in compliance with current CAN SPAM laws. You can unsubscribe from our mailing lists at any time by clicking on this link. You will then be taken to another page which will ask you to confirm your wish to unsubscribe from our mailing list. If you choose to unsubscribe you will never receive any e-mails from us again. Should you choose to re-subscribe to any of our mailing lists then please subscribe again using the online form provided (usually located in the menu bar).
Any personally identifiable information you send us (e.g. by subscribing to our newsletter, or by mailing us) will only be used by us. We will never sell, rent or otherwise disseminate your personal details to any other website, business or individuals. If you choose to unsubscribe from our mailing lists then you will never again receive notifications from us of any kind.
