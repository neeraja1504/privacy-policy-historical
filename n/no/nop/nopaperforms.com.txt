In addition, if you click on certain "banner ads" or other third-party advertisements on our Website that link you to third-party owned and/or operated websites (please also see "Other Websites," below), we may use tracking software provided by third-party vendors to track your "clicks" and/or your other responses to such third-party advertisements (including whether you make purchases from any such third-party advertiser through the third-party's website), to help calculate commissions that we may have earned from such third-party advertisers for such "clicks" and other responses to third-party advertisements on our Website. This tracking software may also help us and third-party advertisers measure the effectiveness of third-party advertisements on our Website.
