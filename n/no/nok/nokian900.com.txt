Posted by Admin on
August 26, 2008
We are committed to protecting the privacy and security of the users of our site.
This privacy policy will advise you about how we protect your personal information, and about what choices you have concerning our use of such information. Please read this policy carefully. We may need to change this policy from time to time in order to address new issues and reflect changes on our site. We will post those changes here so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose that information to anyone. Please refer back to this policy regularly.
Scope Of Privacy Policy
This policy applies to your use of this site.
Personal Identification Information
We don’t request any personal identification information from you (name, email, address, etc).
Non-Personal Identification Information
We collect non-personal identification information through the use of:
“Cookie” technology: A “cookie” is an element of data that a web site can send to your browser, which may then store it on your system.
“IP address tracking”: An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer when you are on the Internet. When you request pages from our site, our servers log your IP address.
Non-personal identification information that we collect might include: the browser you use, the type of computer, technical information about your means of connection to our site such as the operating systems and the Internet service providers utilized, and other similar information.
Most browsers are set to accept cookies. You can set your browser to refuse cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. If you do so, please note that some parts of the site may not function properly.
Cookies and Web Beacons
We also use third party advertisements to support our site. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).
Google and DoubleClick DART cookies
We may use DART cookies for ad serving through Google’s DoubleClick, which places a cookie on your computer when you are browsing the web and visit a site using DoubleClick advertising (including some Google AdSense advertisements). This cookie is used to serve ads specific to you and your interests (“interest based targeting”). The ads served will be targeted based on your previous browsing history (For example, if you have been viewing sites about visiting Las Vegas, you may see Las Vegas hotel advertisements when viewing a non-related site, such as on a site about hockey). DART uses “non personally identifiable information”. It does NOT track personal information about you, such as your name, email address, physical address, telephone number, social security numbers, bank account numbers or credit card numbers. You can opt-out of this ad serving on all sites using this advertising by clicking here.
- Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on your site.
- Google’s use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and other sites on the Internet.
- Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy.
You may view, edit and add to the categories used to provide you with interest-based advertising in the Ads Preferences Manager.
