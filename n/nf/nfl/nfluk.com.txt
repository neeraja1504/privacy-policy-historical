NFLUK.com | Privacy Policy
Updated as May 21, 2018
This privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") applies to this website www.nfluk.com (the "Website"). The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to disclose to you what information we may collect, how we may collect it, with whom we may share it, and certain other matters related to such information, including the choices you have regarding our collection of information and our use and disclosure to other parties of information we may have collected from you.
The Website is maintained and operated by NFL International Ltd ("NFL IL"), whose offices are at 30 Panton Street, Leicester Square, London, SW1Y 4AJ. NFL IL is a member of the National Football League and part of the NFL group of companies (the "NFL Family" - as described in Section 4 below) (collectively, "we", "our", or "us"), and if you use this Website your personally identifiable information will be shared among the members of the NFL Family as described below. We have contracted with third parties, including, without limitation, OverTier and Two Circles, to operate certain aspects of the Site, such as the following subscription products: Audio Pass, Game Pass, Game Rewind and Red Zone (collectively, the "Subscription Products").
We are responsible for the information collected via the Website and we may use it for our own purposes, including marketing. Please note that this Privacy Policy applies only to information collected via the Website; it does not apply to any other information collected or obtained through other means or information collected by the thirty-two individual NFL member clubs (the "Member Clubs").
If you have questions or complaints regarding our privacy policy or practices, please contact us at  enquiries@NFL.com.  If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third-party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request. You may lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority if you consider that our processing of your Personal Data infringes applicable law.
NFL IL is the data controller for processing of personal information. When this Privacy Policy uses the term "personally identifiable information" or "personal information," we mean information defined as personal data under applicable data protection law. That includes information that identifies or could identify by expending reasonable effort a particular individual, such as your name, street address, email address, or certain online identifiers. When other information, such as a favourite team or player, is associated with personal information, it also becomes personally identifiable information for the purposes of this privacy policy.

Your decision to register is voluntary and you will have the opportunity to decide whether or not to disclose information to us and what communications you would like to receive; however, please be advised that many products and services available on the Website require registration and if you elect not to provide such information, you will not be able to take advantage of those products and services.

Tracking Technologies NFL IL and its partners use cookies or similar technologies to analyse trends, administer the website, track users? movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functions on our website or service. To manage Flash cookies, please click here: http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html
These small bits of code automatically identify your browser to the Website whenever your computer is used to visit the Website. Tracking Technologies also let us know how many people visit the Website and where visitors go on the Website. In addition, cookies can let us know non-personally identifiable information, like how many times a user has been on certain pages. For registered users, cookies can make using the Website easier for you by saving information such as your passwords or preferences. By tracking how and when you use the Website, tracking technologies help us determine which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the Website are based on data obtained from tracking technologies. Accepting cookies allows you, among other things, to personalise your experience on the Website. Tracking technologies may also allow the Website to present to you advertising which may be of interest to you. If you do not want information collected through the use of tracking technologies, your browser should contain an option that allows you to disable or delete cookie data at any time. Some areas of the Website, however, may not provide you with a personalised experience if you have disabled the use of tracking technologies. We set out below a more complete description of the tracking technologies used by the Website and the purposes for which they are used.
IP Addresses and Click-Stream Data We may collect IP addresses and/or click-stream data. An IP address is a number associated with the service through which you access the Internet, like your ISP (Internet service provider), your company, or your university. Standing alone, your IP address is not personally identifiable. At times, we also use IP addresses for purposes of system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers and sponsors, for example regarding the frequency with which our guests visit various parts of the Website. We may combine this information with personally identifiable information we obtain from you directly on the Website or any other of our other websites, or from third parties.
Click-stream data is information collected by our computers when you request pages from the Website. Click-stream data may include such information as the page served, the time, the source of the request, the type of browser making the request, the preceding page view and other such non-personal information. When analysed, this data helps us analyse how visitors arrive at the Website, what type of content is most popular, what type of visitors in the aggregate are interested in particular kinds of content and advertising, and the like.
Transaction Information
If you conduct a financial or other transaction with the Website, such as subscribe to a Subscription Product or other products/services offered on the Website, we will ask you to complete an order form that will request certain information from you, including contact information, demographic information and/or financial information. In some instances, we may direct you to a third party vendor site to collect this information from you directly. Even though the collection form may have the look and feel of www.nfluk.com, please be aware you will be giving your information directly to the third-party vendor, and that in some instances such third party vendor's privacy policy will govern the collection of your personal information. Please reference the privacy policies available from these pages for any privacy related concerns.
We and/or our vendor will use this information to complete the financial or other transaction that you have requested, i.e. to deliver the information, products or other services that you request or purchase, to invoice you, and in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy. For your protection, financial information is collected and stored through encrypted means.

4.          WITH WHOM THE INFORMATION MAY BE SHARED At times, as described below, we may share your personal information with others for the specified purposes:
·    Agents: We employ other businesses (e.g., Two Circles, Inc.), certain services and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, providing the Subscription Products, sending email, removing repetitive information from customer lists, Website analysis, analysing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. We may share information with third-parties, such as social networking platforms, so that they may send tailored communications on our behalf via their platforms. These companies may have access to personally identifiable information needed to perform their functions, but may not use or disclose it for other purposes, like sending you marketing offers about their products.
·    Aggregate Information: We may share aggregate information, such as demographics and Website usage statistics, with advertisers, sponsors or other organisations, to help them improve their products and services. When this type of information is shared, the other parties do not have access to your personally identifiable information.
·    Opt-in to Receive Third Party Offers: Throughout the Website you may be presented with an opportunity to receive information and/or marketing offers sent from third party(s). Opt-in opportunities will ask you if you would like your personally identifiable information to be shared with such third party(s) as necessary to receive such information or marketing offers. If you do not elect to "opt-in" to having your personally identifiable information shared, your personally identifiable information will not be shared with such third party(s). If you do choose to have your personally identifiable information shared, your personally identifiable information will be transferred to such third party(s) solely for the purpose of permitting such third party(s) to provide you with such information and marketing offers. Such third party(s) is/are not authorised by us to disclose your personally identifiable information to any other third parties. Please be advised that if you elect to provide your personally identifiable information in response to such third party(s) marketing offers or otherwise, all information you disclose to such third party(s) will be subject to the privacy policy and practices of such third party(s). We are not responsible for the privacy practices and policies of such third party(s) and, therefore, you should review the privacy practices and policies of such third party(s) prior to providing your personally identifiable information to such third party(s).
·    Products or Services Offered in Partnership with Third-Party(s): Certain products and/or services available on the Website are provided to you in partnership with third party(s) and may require you to disclose personally identifiable information in order to register for and access such products and/or services. Such products and/or services shall identify the third party partners at the point of registration.

·    Subsidiaries and Affiliates: We may share your information (including, without limitation, personally identifiable information) for the purposes set forth above with all members of the NFL Family, including, without limitation, our subsidiaries and affiliates (e.g., NFL International Ltd, NFL International LLC, NFL International Ltd, NFL Ventures, L.P., and NFL Ventures, Inc.), and any of the Member Clubs where you have indicated a preference (each of whom has its own privacy policy, which is available on each Member Club's respective website).
·    Third-Party Ad Serving and Audience and Traffic Measurement Services: We may use a third-party network advertiser to serve the advertisements on the Website or may use a traffic measurement service to analyse the traffic on the Website. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to this Website and other websites you have visited. Third-party ad serving enables us to target advertisements to you for products or websites you might be interested in. Audience and Traffic Measurement Services allow us to collect anonymous traffic and behaviour information from the Website by monitoring anonymous visitor activity. Although advertisers or other companies do not have access to the Website cookies, the Website's advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may themselves set and access their own cookies on your computer if you choose to have your cookies enabled in your browser. Cookies allow third-party advertisers to show you advertisements or content you might be interested in. Note that any images (or any other parts of a web page) served by third parties in association with third-party cookies may serve as web beacons, which enable third parties to carry out the previously described activities. Other companies' uses of their cookies are subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Please click here in order to learn more about the information collection practices and "opt-out" procedures of third-party ad servers we may use.
·    Business Transfers: In the event that all or substantially all of our assets are sold or transferred to another party, or another transaction occurs in which your personally identifiable information is one of the business assets transferred, all personally identifiable information that has been collected and saved may be one of the business assets we transfer. You will be notified of such a transfer in accordance with the "Changes to the Policy" section below.
·    Administrative or Legal Process: We or others may disclose your personal information to third parties without notice to you in order to comply with applicable law, law enforcement agencies, to protect our or third parties' rights, or to protect the rights of other users of the Website.
Some of these parties (for example, many members of the NFL Family) may be located in countries, such as the United States, other than your own, whose privacy and data protection laws may not be equivalent to those in your country of residence. When we transfer your personal information to other countries, including the United States, we apply appropriate safeguards, to protect your information and comply with applicable laws. For example, we implement measures such as standard data protection contractual clauses to ensure that any transferred Personal Data, remains protected and secure. A copy of these clauses can be obtained by emailing enquiries@nfl.com.

For example, if you "click" on a banner advertisement, the "click" may take you off the Website onto a different website. This includes links from advertisers, sponsors and marketing partners that may use the Website's logo as part of a co-branding agreement. These other websites may send their own cookies to you, independently collect data or solicit personal information and may or may not have their own published privacy policies. If you visit a website that is linked to the Website, you should consult that website's privacy policy before providing any personal information.
