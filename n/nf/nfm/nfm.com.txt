WHAT INFORMATION ABOUT ME IS COLLECTED ON OUR WEBSITE?
We collect two types of information: personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information.
Personally Identifiable Information.
Personally identifiable information is information that identifies you or can be used to identify or contact you (“Personally Identifiable Information”). Such Personally Identifiable Information may include your name, address, email address, telephone number, age (primarily for eligibility purposes), and billing and credit card information. We may request Personally Identifiable Information from you when you register on our Website, purchase products online or in connection with other services we may make available on our Website from time to time. In all of these cases, we will collect Personally Identifiable Information from you only if you voluntarily submit such information to us. Unless you give us permission to do so, we will not sell, share, license, trade or rent your Personally Identifiable Information other than as specified in this Privacy Policy. You do not have to provide us with any Personally Identifiable Information to visit our Website. However, if you choose to withhold requested information, you may not be able to visit all sections of our Website or purchase our products. In addition, we may not be able to provide you with some of the other services we offer that are dependent upon the collection of such information.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information.
When you visit our Website we may collect information that by itself cannot be used to identify or contact you, such as IP addresses, browser types, domain names, and other anonymous statistical data involving the use of our Website (“Non-Personally Identifiable Information”). Non-Personally Identifiable Information is used to help us understand who uses our Website and to improve and market our Website in general and our products in particular.
WHERE AND WHEN IS INFORMATION COLLECTED ON OUR WEBSITE (INCLUDING THROUGH THE USE OF COOKIES)?
We may collect information (including information that is Personally Identifiable Information) from you in different manners and at different places and times on our Website. We also may collect information from you in connection with, or through, other information or services we may make available on our Website from time to time. The following is a description of the areas and/or manners in which we primarily collect information about you.
Cookies.
We also collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information passively using “cookies.” “Cookies” are small text files that are placed on your computer in order to identify your Web browser and the activities of your computer on our Website and other websites. Cookies are used to personalize your experience on our Website (such as dynamically generating content on web pages specifically designed for you), and to allow us to statistically monitor how you are using our Website to help us improve our online offerings. We also may use cookies to target certain advertisements to your browser which may be of interest to you or to determine the popularity of certain content. While you are not required to accept our cookies to access our Website, if you reject cookies, certain products, offerings, features, or resources of our Website may not work properly and you may experience some loss of convenience.
Online Products.
We collect information, some of which may be Personally Identifiable Information, that you voluntarily provide to us when you choose to purchase our products online. We also collect information that you provide voluntarily through responses to special offerings such as surveys, questionnaires, self-assessment quizzes, contests and the like. Some of these special offerings may ask you for additional information. We collect this information in order to offer you products or services that we think may be of interest to you.

We may disclose information (including Personally Identifiable Information) about you to our Affiliates.

Any information relating to you that we provide to our Affiliates will be treated by those Affiliates in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.
We may also disclose your information (including Personally Identifiable Information)if we believe in good faith that we are required to do so in order to comply with an applicable statute, regulation, rule or law, a subpoena, a search warrant, a court or regulatory order, or other valid legal process. We may disclose Personally Identifiable Information in special circumstances when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our  Terms of Use to protect the safety and/or security of our users, our Website or the general public.
We may provide to third parties information about you that does not allow you to be identified or contacted, including where such information is combined with similar information of other users of our Website. For example, we might inform third parties regarding the number of unique users who visit our Website, the demographic breakdown of our registered user of our Website, or the activities that visitors to our Website engage in while on our Website. The third parties to which we may provide this information may include potential or actual advertisers, providers of advertising services (including website tracking services), commercial partners, sponsors, licensees, researchers and other similar parties.
DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY APPLY WHEN I LINK TO OTHER WEBSITES?
Our Website contains links to other websites not owned or operated by Nebraska Furniture Mart, Inc. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such websites. We encourage you to be aware when our Website links to other websites and to read the privacy policies or statements of each and every website. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by our Website.
IS THE INFORMATION COLLECTED ON OUR WEBSITE SECURE?
We want your information (including Personally Identifiable Information) to remain as secure as possible. We strive to provide secure transmission of your information from your computer to our servers through industry-standard techniques. We endeavor to secure the Personally Identifiable Information you provide on servers which we believe are located in controlled, secure environments, protected from unauthorized access, use, or alteration. Only employees and authorized agents, vendors and suppliers who need access to your information to perform a specific task or function are granted access to such information. In addition, all Nebraska Furniture Mart, Inc. employees must abide by this Privacy Policy and are kept up-to-date on security practices. Any employee who violates this Privacy Policy is subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. We also require that our authorized agents, vendors and suppliers (i) protect the privacy of your Personally Identifiable Information consistent with this Privacy Policy, and (ii) not use or disclose your Personally Identifiable Information for any purpose other than providing us with products or services for which we contracted.
Notwithstanding the above commitments to protect your information (including Personally Identifiable Information) from loss, misuse or alteration by third parties, you should be aware that there is always some risk involved in transmitting information over the Internet. There is also some risk that others could find a way to thwart our security systems. As a result, while we strive to protect your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security and privacy of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.
WHAT CHOICES DO I HAVE REGARDING THE COLLECTION, DISCLOSURE AND DISTRIBUTION OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION?
Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, we will only use Personally Identifiable Information for the purposes described above or as otherwise disclosed at the time we request such information from you. You must “opt-in” and give us permission to use your Personally Identifiable Information for any other purpose. For example, we have an “opt-in” mechanism so that those who become registered users or subscribe to our Website must give us permission to send them marketing materials and our electronic newsletter.
CAN I UPDATE OR CORRECT MY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION?
You can always contact us in order to (1) update or correct your Personally Identifiable Information, (2) change your preferences with respect to communications and other information you receive from us, or (3) delete the Personally Identifiable Information maintained about you on our systems, by contacting  customer care. Such updates, corrections, changes and deletions will not have an effect on other information that we maintain, or information that we have provided to third-parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy prior to such update, correction, change or deletion.
You should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove each and every record of the information you have provided to us from our system. The need to back-up our systems to protect information from inadvertent loss means that a copy of your Personally Identifiable Information may exist in a non-erasable form that will be difficult or impossible for us to locate. We promise that promptly after receiving your request, all Personally Identifiable Information stored in databases we actively use and other readily searchable media will be updated, corrected, changed or deleted, as appropriate, as soon as reasonably practicable.
HOW WILL I KNOW IF THERE ARE ANY CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY?
Changes to this Privacy Policy will be posted on our Website so you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use Personally Identifiable Information in a manner significantly different from that stated in this Privacy Policy, or otherwise disclosed to you, at the time it was collected, we will notify you by email, and you will have a choice as to whether or not we use your Personally Identifiable Information in the new manner. We may also make non-significant changes to our Privacy Policy that generally will not affect our use of your Personally Identifiable Information. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, you should not use our website.
