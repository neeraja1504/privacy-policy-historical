8. Data Sharing
Although Navy Federal does not share your Personal Information with nonaffiliated third-party companies, we are aware that you may choose to do so in order to use their services. For example, you may have authorized some third-party companies to access your Personal Information and account data to offer financial information and services such as: account aggregation (consolidating your financial account information from different sources), making payments via a website or mobile application, and tax preparation. Because these third-party companies have access to your Personal Information and account data and may use your account login credentials in order to provide the service, we recommend that you use caution when granting such access to these types of third-party companies.
Some of these third-party companies may use other companies to assist them with providing services or with accessing your Personal Information or account data. Any one or all of these companies may be storing your Personal Information or account data. Navy Federal is not responsible for the use or disclosure of any Personal Information or account data accessed by or on behalf of any company or person to whom you provide your Navy Federal login credentials or account information. We do not control the privacy, security or accuracy of your information that may be held by these third party companies which are governed by the third-party’s privacy policy and data security program. We are also not responsible for any fees associated with these third-party services.
When you provide your login credentials to your Navy Federal accounts to a third party, you will be deemed by us to have authorized all transactions or actions initiated by that third party using the access information you provided, whether or not you are aware of the specific transaction or action.
If you decide to revoke the access authority you previously gave to a third party, we strongly recommend that you change your Navy Federal password to ensure that the party cannot continue to access your account. For security and other reasons, Navy Federal reserves the right to block or disable third-party access to any account without notice.
