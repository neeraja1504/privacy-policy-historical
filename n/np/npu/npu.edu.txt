CHILDREN'S PRIVACY
NPU's website is not intended for children under the age of 13 and there are no areas specifically set aside for children under age 13. Nonetheless, we recognize that the NPU's website may be of general interest to all audiences and we therefore encourage parents to assist their children if they intend to explore our website.
