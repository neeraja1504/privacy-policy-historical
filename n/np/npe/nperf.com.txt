ARTICLE 4: OPERATION OF THE NPERF TEST 4.1. Speed measurement
The speed test is based on the downloading of incompressible data with one or more simultaneous connections in order to saturate the User's connection for a few seconds in order to measure its capacity. The peak speed corresponds to the average of the highest 30% of the consecutive samples (50% for the upload rate). The average speed rate is calculated after discarding the lowest 5% and highest 5% of the samples.
4.2. Measurement of latency
The latency test consists of measuring the time it takes for a small data packet to reach the server and then return to your terminal. It is carried out ten times minimum. The result is a minimum, an average and jitter (maximum variation between measurements).
4.3. Performance in navigation
The navigation test consists of loading different websites and measuring the loading time. The performance index is obtained from the loading time.
4.4. Video performance (streaming test)
The video streaming test involves loading and playing a streaming video and measuring the loading time and any buffering (video pause) of the video. The performance index is the ratio of the video's loading and playing time to its nominal duration.
4.5. Score calculation
The final score is calculated from the results of the various tests listed above, in order to provide a global indicator of the user experience, using an exclusive NPERF algorithm.

The legitimate interest :
nPerf has a legitimate interest in processing your data (selling technical data to its business customers, fixed and mobile network telecom operators) which is justified, balanced and does not undermine your privacy [See below, rights of individuals]. When using our applications, your IP addresses are collected to protect our computer systems against fraud or cyber-attacks.
5. Who are the recipients of your personal data?
The following are likely to have access to your personal data:
Some nPerf technical department staff filter your data before sending it to nPerf business customers.
Your personal data may be transmitted to the service providers (subcontractors) that nPerf relies on for the performance of its activities to:
* Host nPerf data on servers exclusively based in France.
* Manage nPerf user accounts (subcontractor based outside the European Economic Area).
* Manage certain functions of nPerf applications (subcontractor based outside the European Economic Area).
Your personal data may also be transmitted to nPerf business customers :
* Fixed and mobile Telephone Operators.
* Telecom partners
* Private companies
* Public institutions
nPerf sells this collected data to fixed and mobile network telecom operators through service agreements, so that they can evaluate themselves against the competition and improve the performance of their networks.
Your collected IP addresses may thus be communicated to these business customers on an express condition that these IP addresses are only used by them for the exclusive purpose of technical diagnostics, to the exclusion of any other purpose (particularly marketing or sales purposes).
6. How long do we keep your personal data?
The retention period for your personal data varies depending on why it is processed:
* Your nPerf account details are kept until the end date of your user account (more precisely 7 days later, the time to completely erase account data).
* Your IP address and other technical data collected during your tests on nPerf applications are kept for five (5) years following their collection and will be then anonymized.

8. Is your personal data transmitted outside the European Union?
Some of our subcontractors are established outside the European Economic Area, and in a country not recognised by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of protection, and are likely to have access to some of your personal data. nPerf ensures that this transfer is carried out in compliance with the applicable regulations and guarantees a sufficient level of protection of your personal data (in particular, on a case-by-case basis, by the regularisation of contractual clauses based on the European Commission's model, or any other mechanism that complies with the regulations on the protection of personal data, the "Privacy Shield" in the USA).
9. Security of your personal data
nPerf undertakes to take all necessary measures, in view of the nature of the data and the risks associated with their processing, to protect the security of your personal data and, in particular, to prevent their corruption, damage, or use by unauthorised third parties.
