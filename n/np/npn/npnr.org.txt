Welcome to npnr.org (The National Phone Number Registry). We believe you should know what information is collected during your visit.
To make our site as informative as possible, we accept comments submitted from internet users such as yourself. We have no reasonable way of verifying the validity and accuracy of such information. Comments that are abusive and/or simply just questionable are removed immediately and without notice. These comments are stored in a secure database in a secure data center and we do not sell or share this information in any way besides being posted on this web site.
Additionally, we collect and aggregate specific information on what pages our users are accessing when they visit. This information is used to generate reports that may help us assess the value and usefulness of our site and provide statistical information. This information includes your TCP/IP address, which does not identify you personally.
We also use a feature of your web browser called a "cookie". This cookie simply identifies the computer or mobile device you are using while browsing our site. Our advertisers may also use their own cookies that we do not control.
The DoubleClick cookie
The DoubleClick cookie is used by Google in the ads served on the websites of its partners, such as websites displaying AdSense ads or participating in Google certified ad networks. When users visit a partner's website and either view or click on an ad, a cookie may be dropped on that end user's browser.
Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to your website.
Google's use of the DoubleClick cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and/or other sites on the Internet.
Users may opt out of the use of the DoubleClick cookie for interest-based advertising by visiting Ads Settings. (Alternatively, you can direct users to opt out of a third-party vendor's use of cookies for interest based advertising by visiting aboutads.info.)
