Privacy, Security & Identity Theft | NRMA Insurance
Please read this statement along with our Privacy Policy.
We take the protection of your personal information very seriously, so we regularly revise and update our security measures to keep your information private and meet industry standards.
Steps we take to protect your information
We encrypt your information as it travels between your computer and our computers. We use a form of Transport Layer Security (TLS) to stop anyone intercepting your information
Your personal information is stored on computer systems which are protected by a combination of firewalls, secure logon processes, encryption and intrusion monitoring technologies
We use a recognised payment service provider to process any insurance payments you make using this website. This service provider is committed to protecting your personal information on our behalf
In certain circumstances we will collect and use your IP address to protect the security of our website
We regularly test our websites and infrastructure for vulnerabilities and take action where needed
We apply security patches to software provided by vendors
Steps you can take to protect your information
It’s still very important that you take some steps to help keep up security when you’re online:
Protect your personal information, such as usernames, passwords and policy details, by not allowing anyone to see you entering them, and avoid public Wi-Fi usage
Notify us as soon as possible if you become aware of any security breaches
Use a strong password for your account. Try to think of something that is easy to remember, but hard to guess, such as a passphrase
Change your password regularly and try not to reuse the same password on more than one site
Don’t let your browser save your password for our websites
Be wary of websites, emails or phone calls that claim to be from us. Please contact us if you are unsure
Keep an eye on your accounts and check for any unauthorised transactions
Keep your devices up to date with firewall enabled, anti-malware software, anti-virus software and security updates
How do you make sure you’re going to the right website?
Always go directly to our website by typing the address www.nrma.com.au rather than following links found in emails or elsewhere online.
Keeping safe with email
Never disclose personal, financial or debit/credit card information by email. Contact us if you’re unsure of the legitimacy of any email that appears to have come from us.
We will never ask for sensitive or personal information such as usernames, passwords or policy details if you haven’t asked for our help first.
By helping us with these things, we can both work to make your world a safer place. To report any concerns around the security or privacy of your information please email cybersecurity@iag.com.au.

How information is collected
Information that is not capable of identifying you, such as the number of users visiting this website, is collected through code embedded in the webpages of this website. You cannot disable the code on these pages.
Other information, such as browser type, is included in a ‘cookie’ that is sent to your computer when you are completing certain tasks on this website.

We may also use technologies similar to cookies in emails you receive either directly from us or from third party email providers sending emails on our behalf. These technologies help us understand whether you have opened the email, and how you have interacted with it. They also help us understand what you may find of interest and can assist us, for example, in tailoring the advertising we display to you on websites where we have an arrangement in place to serve advertisements. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way you can disable HTML images or refuse HTML (select Text only) within your email software, and you should not click on any links within the email (with the exception of the unsubscribe link).
