AUTOMATICALLY COLLECTED DATA AND ANONYMOUS INFORMATION
Each time you visit NRMP’s websites, NRMP , its partners, and/or vendors collect information to improve the overall quality of your online experience.
Aggregated Data
NRMP collects data for internal reporting and counts, tracks, and aggregates the visitor’s activity for the purpose of analysis of general traffic flow and feature usage related to NRMP websites. To those ends, NRMP may include information about you in aggregated group data. NRMP may remove personal identifiers from Personal Data or may use pseudonymization to disassociate the individual from the Personal Data, allowing statistically accurate analysis of data without exposing any individual’s identity. Such anonymous data may be shared with NRMP affiliates, business partners, service providers and/or vendors; if it does so, NRMP will not disclose your individual identity.
Web Server Logs and IP Addresses
An IP address is a number that automatically identifies the computer or device you use to access the Internet. The IP address enables our server to send you the web pages that you want to visit, and it may disclose the server owned by your Internet Service Provider. NRMP may use IP addresses to conduct analyses and performance reviews and to administer the websites, and also may use other information provided by you or your browser for purposes such as enabling support for applications and services being used.
Cookies
Cookies and similar technologies within a web browser allow persistent storage of data as you navigate the website. This functionality does not personally identify users, although it does allow the web server to differentiate one user from another. Many websites use cookies and similar technologies to provide website and application features when a user visits the website, and most web browsers are set up to accept cookies. NRMP uses cookies to allow our website to function and improve delivery of your online experience. You can set your browser to refuse cookies, but most functionality of your experience with NRMP may not work properly and you may be required to re-enter certain information each time you use our website. Some features allow data to remain only for the time that your browser is open, for example a session cookie. A persistent cookie is an example of functionality that your browser provides that allows the data to persist on your device/computer even after the browser is closed. Like many other organizations with websites, NRMP may use both types of functionality your browser provides.
Google Analytics
We use cookies provided by Google Analytics to better understand and personalize your use of the Services. Google Analytics collects information like demographic data, how often users visit our websites, what pages they visit when they do so, and what website they used prior to coming to our website.  To process analytics data when you visit NRMP’s website, Google Analytics may use various technologies, including cookies or similar technologies to identify your browser or computer device. Google does not receive your user account information, your email address, or other personally identifiable information through the use of Google Analytics cookies. You can opt out of Google Analytics on the website and onboard entertainment portal.

NRMP  shares both non-personal and Personal Data with those parties under certain limited restrictions including requirements to keep the Personal Data confidential, destroy the Personal Data once it no longer is needed for the intended purpose (except for applications to medical education institutions), and to prevent unauthorized release of Personal Data. NRMP  conducts such exchanges in a secure manner designed to protect against access by unauthorized parties. Rank order list information is never shared with third parties, except under court order or in response to a subpoena issued by a court of competent jurisdiction. Other than for the specific purposes noted in this Privacy Statement or in any terms and conditions that otherwise apply to you, we do not share Personal Data and we never use or share any of your Personal Data for advertising or marketing purposes.
HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR DATA
If the services provided are intended to protect the public, for example through the assurance of an individual’s qualification through NRMP’s verification services, NRMP has a legitimate interest in retaining this information and will do so in accordance with its data retention policy.
For other services, we keep your Personal Data only for as long as is reasonably necessary to achieve the purposes for which it was collected, whether that is to provide services to you, for our own legitimate interests (described above), or so that we can comply with the law.
We will actively review the information we hold and when there no longer is a user, legal, or business need for us to hold it, we will either delete it securely or in some cases irreversibly anonymize it. When we delete any information, it will be deleted from our active databases but may remain in our archives.
HOW WE PROTECT YOUR DATA
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and facilitate the correct use of Personal Data obtained through our website, we have put in place appropriate physical, technical, and operational measures to safeguard and secure the Personal Data we collect online against unauthorized access, unlawful use, accidental loss, corruption, or destruction.
We also use operational measures to protect the data, for example by limiting the number of people who have access to the databases in which your Match results information is held. Access to Personal Data is restricted to  ** NRMP**  staff members and third party service providers who require the access for specific purposes, such as helping us provide services to you or performing research.
We use technical measures such as encryption and password protection to protect your data and the systems where they are stored. However, messages you send to us through the Internet or otherwise electronically may not be secure. We recommend that you do not send any confidential information to us by email. If you choose to send confidential information to us, you accept the risk that a third party may intercept this information.
LOCATION OF YOUR DATA / DATA TRANSFER
NRMP is located in the United States (“U.S.”) and is subject to the applicable laws of the United States (where data privacy laws are less stringent than in the European Union and some other jurisdictions). We will store and process information we receive about you, as described in this Privacy Statement, in the U.S.
When we receive your Personal Data, your Personal Data may be transferred, processed, and stored outside of your country of origin, including the United States for the purposes described in this Privacy Statement. Some of the recipients of Personal Data as specified above may be located in countries (including the United States) that do not provide a level of data protection equivalent to that set forth by the European Union and some other jurisdictions.
If you choose to access or use the Services offered by NRMP , you consent to the transfer, use, and disclosure of information in accordance with this Privacy Notice and subject to such applicable laws.
If we do transfer Personal Data outside the U.S., we will make sure that it is protected in the same way as if it were being used in the U.S. We will use one of the following safeguards to ensure your information is protected:
Transfer the data to a non-EEA country that has privacy laws at least as protective as those within the EEA, or
Put in place a contract with the recipient of the data, which means the recipient must protect the data to the same standards as required within the EEA, or
Transfer it to organizations that are part of the Privacy Shield.  The Privacy Shield is a framework that sets out the standards for data to be sent between the United States and European countries.  The Privacy Shield ensures that data are protected to the same standards as used within the EEA.
By submitting any Personal Data or by using our websites and mobile application and without limitation to any other rights or obligations we have, you consent to such transfer to and processing in the United States and these other countries and you acknowledge that your information may be subject to access by law enforcement and other government entities including courts and tribunals, in accordance with laws applicable in those jurisdictions.
YOUR RIGHTS OVER YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
If the services provided are intended to protect the public, for example through the assurance of an individual’s qualifications through _ NRMP’s verification services, then in accordance with NRMP _policies and procedures you may not have a right to erasure of your Personal Data, to restrict processing of your Personal Data, or to object to the processing of your Personal Data.
For other services, in accordance with NRMP’s policies and procedures you have the right to review, verify, correct, and request erasure of the Personal Data that we hold about you under certain circumstances.  You also have the right to limit, restrict, or object to the processing of your Personal Data under certain circumstances. You may also have the right to request that we transfer your Personal Data to another party to the extent provided for under applicable data privacy laws.
Access to your Personal Data is available through your  ** NRMP  login credentials (username and password). When you register for an  ** NRMP  Match, you have an opportunity to correct or update most information you have provided using our website.

In the alternative and in some cases to correct and update certain types of information (e.g., date of birth, name), you may contact NRMP  directly at the address below to report corrections, or to limit, restrict, or object to the processing of your data.
If you gave us your consent to the collection and processing of your Personal Data, you have the right to withdraw your consent for that specific processing by individual newsletter and / or email list. Information about how to prevent your data from being used for research purposes is set out under the heading “Data Collection For Educational Research”. Please note that even if you withdraw your consent, we can still rely on the consent you gave as the lawful basis for processing your data before you withdrew your consent.
You can object to our use of your data where we rely on our legitimate interests to do so. We explained the legitimate interests under the heading How We Use Your Personal Data.
If you want to review, verify, correct, or request erasure of your Personal Data; limit, restrict, or object to the processing of your Personal Data; or request a transfer of your Personal Data to another party, please contact us at datarequest@nullnrmp.org or write to us at National Resident Matching Program, ATTN: Data Protection, 2121 K Street NW, Suite 1000, Washington, DC 20037.  To protect your privacy and security, we also will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access, making corrections, or following such a request to correct or delete your data.
When you contact us, we will respond as soon as possible and where possible within one month. If your request is more complicated, it may take longer to respond to you, but we will respond within two months of your request. There is no charge for most requests, but if you ask us to provide a significant amount of data, for example, we may ask you to pay a reasonable administrative fee. We also may ask you to verify your identity before we provide any information to you.
