RETAINING AND DELETING PERSONAL DATA
This Section 7 sets out our data retention policies and procedure, which are designed to help ensure that we comply with our legal obligations in relation to the retention and deletion of personal data.
Personal data that we process for any purpose or purposes shall not be kept for longer than is necessary for that purpose or those purposes.
We will retain your personal data as follows:
Personal data will be retained for as long as you retain a user account on the Platform or request erasure of your personal data, whichever is later.
Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 7, we may retain your personal data where such retention is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject, or in order to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another natural person.
YOUR RIGHTS
In this Section 8, we have summarised the rights that you may have under data protection law. Some of the rights are complex, and not all of the details have been included in our summaries. Accordingly, you should read the relevant laws and guidance from the regulatory authorities for a full explanation of these rights.
Your principal rights under data protection law may include:
(a) the right to access;
(b) the right to rectification;
(c) the right to erasure;
(d) the right to restrict processing;
(e) the right to object to processing;
(f) the right to data portability;
(g) the right to complain to a supervisory authority; and
(h) the right to withdraw consent.
You have the right to confirmation as to whether or not we process your personal data and, where we do, access to the personal data, together with certain additional information. That additional information includes details of the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data concerned and the recipients of the personal data. Providing the rights and freedoms of others are not affected, we will supply to you a copy of your personal data. The first copy will be provided free of charge, but additional copies may be subject to a reasonable fee.
You have the right to have any inaccurate personal data about you rectified and, taking into account the purposes of the processing, to have any incomplete personal data about you completed.
In some circumstances you have the right to the erasure of your personal data without undue delay. Those circumstances include: the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed; you withdraw consent to consent-based processing; you object to the processing under certain rules of applicable data protection law; the processing is for direct marketing purposes; and the personal data have been unlawfully processed. However, there are exclusions of the right to erasure. The general exclusions include where processing is necessary: for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information; for compliance with a legal obligation; or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
In some circumstances you have the right to restrict the processing of your personal data. However, we will only otherwise process it: with your consent; for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person; or for reasons of important public interest.
You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data on grounds relating to your particular situation, but only to the extent that the legal basis for the processing is that the processing is necessary for: the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of any official authority vested in us; or the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party. If you make such an objection, we will cease to process the personal information unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing is for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes (including profiling for direct marketing purposes). If you make such an objection, we will cease to process your personal data for this purpose.
You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes on grounds relating to your particular situation, unless the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest.
USERS RESIDENT IN THE EU: If you consider that our processing of your personal information infringes data protection laws, you have a legal right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data protection. You may do so in the EU member state of your habitual residence, your place of work or the place of the alleged infringement.
To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal information is consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing before the withdrawal.
Use of the Platform and providing an email address shall constitute implicit consent for the purpose of receiving regular emails from NRSNG for purposes of obtaining news and information about our services and products and general marketing emails. However, at any point in time you may withdraw your consent by unsubscribing following the instructions in the individual email communications you receive from us.
You may exercise any of your rights in relation to your personal data by contacting us at contact@nrsng.com.

COOKIE NOTICE
In order to provide you with a more personalized and responsive service we need to remember and store information about how you use the Platform. This is done using small text files called cookies. Cookies contain small amounts of information and are downloaded to your computer or other device by a server for the Platform. Your web browser then sends these cookies back to NRSNG on each subsequent visit so that it can recognize you and remember things like your user preferences. You can find more detailed information about cookies and how they work at http://www.aboutcookies.org/.
Whenever you use the Platform, information may be collected through the use of cookies and other technologies. By using the Platform you agree to our use of cookies as described in this section 12 Cookie Notice.
Some of the cookies we use are necessary to enable you to move around the Platform and use its features such as accessing secure areas that may contain content for registered users.
We also use functional cookies to record information about the choices you have made and to allow us to tailor the Platform to our users; for example, to remember your language or region or that you have already completed a survey. This information is usually anonymized and is not used for any purpose unrelated to the Platform.
NRSNG or our service providers also use analytic services to help us understand how effective our content is, what interests our users have, and to improve how the Platform works. In addition, we use web beacons, tracking pixels and similar services to understand more about the visitors to the Platform, and to count visitor numbers and performance cookies to track how many individual users access the Platform and how often. This information is used for statistical purposes and to improve how the Platform works and it is not our intention to use such information to personally identify any user.
However, if at any time you register and sign into the Platform we may combine such data with information from our web analytic services and cookies to analyze how you use the Platform in more detail.
The Platform does use targeting cookies to deliver targeted advertising on the Platform. We may use web beacons (also known as pixel tags) to determine which users have come to the Platform after viewing an advertisement we have served on third party websites. We also work with third parties to collect data so that we can determine the effectiveness of our ads and serve ads targeted to your interests. The use of web beacons does not provide us with any personal information and we do not use this technology to access your personal information. It is used only to compile aggregated data about users who visit the Platform and to gauge the effectiveness of our ads. Web beacons do not place information on your device, but may work in conjunction with cookies to monitor activity. You cannot remove or block web beacons, but you can remove or block cookies with which they work to block the collection of information about your user activity.
