We know protecting personal information is important, and we respect your privacy.

Types of Information We May Collect and How We May Collect It
General Browsing Information — If you visit any of our web properties, mobile sites or applications for general browsing or if you download any collateral assets from a web property, we may generate a “cookie” to collect and store the following general information in order to analyze trends, gather broad demographic information, and monitor site traffic patterns that can help us further develop and improve design and functionality: your computer's IP address, web browser type, mobile device type, and operating system, the date and time you access our site, the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our site and/or the exit page in which you linked away from our site or application; this is also subject to identify various pages that you visited while generally browsing on our site or application. NWF uses a cookie on our website properties, mobile sites and applications for consent to browsing data collection. For more information please reference the “Cookies, Consent and Tracking” section of our policy.
Personally Identifiable Information — If you visit any of our web properties, mobile sites or applications and take any of the following actions: provide your name, email address, physical address, credit card information, participate in social media sharing—information that identifies you as an individual or relates to an identifiable person, we will explicitly notify you before we collect this data and will not collect it unless you choose to provide it to us. If you participate and opt in to our Single Sign-On (SSO) provider, we may collect limited information necessary to identify you against our authentication services. Please reference the Single Sign-On (SSO) section for more information.
The types of personal data may vary depending on the type of activity you are engaged in. The personal data NWF may collect, process and use may include, but are not limited to your name, email address, phone number, photo or other image, birth date, sex, address, friend connections, credit card information, shipping information; and location (only if directly identifiable to you, otherwise NWF treats location as non-personal data).
If you choose to share the name of and contact information for someone who might be interested in engaging with NWF, NWF may store that individual’s name and contact details that you provided to NWF.
NWF may use tools or third-party analytical software to automatically collect and use certain non-personal data that does not directly enable NWF to identify you. For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “non-personal data” means information that does not directly identify you. The types of non-personal data NWF may collect and use include, but are not limited to: (i) device properties, including, but not limited to unique device identifier or other device identifier ("UDID"); (ii) device software platform and firmware; (iii) mobile phone carrier; (iv) geographical data such as zip code, area code and location; (v) game score and achievements; (vi) third party anonymized or pseudonymized ID; (vi) other non-personal data as reasonably required by NWF to enhance the services and other NWF products and services.
Single Sign-On (SSO)
Single Sign-On is an identity provider service that creates and manages user identity information for the purpose of providing authentication services so that we can offer a single user account for multiple NWF services and methods of engagement. Authentication processes utilize data that you are or have previously provided. If your Single Sign-On (SSO) account is removed or deleted, you will no longer have access to a single user account.
European Union and California Privacy Rights
NWF is committed to ensuring the security and protection of the information we possess and to provide an approach to data protection that adheres to relevant data protection laws and regulations.
While these terms explain how we collect and use your information, if you are an individual in a European Union nation or a California resident, you may request information about our use of your personal information. To make such a request, please send an email to: dataprotection@nwf.org.
Children's Information — NWF provides a special place on our website for children and we encourage parents and guardians to visit this part of our site with their children. We respect the privacy of children, and do not collect any more personal information than reasonably necessary to enable them to participate in the activities we offer at our Website. We do not have any agreements with outside organizations to collect personal information at our site. The information we collect from children is used to respond to children's specific requests to participate in activities such as:
contests or sweepstakes
subscription to an online newsletter
voting in polls or otherwise expressing an opinion
sending electronic greeting cards
to tailor/customize the visitor's experience at our site
If you are under 13 years of age or a minor in your country of residence, please ask your legal guardian’s permission to use or access the services. NWF takes children’s privacy seriously, and encourages parents and/or guardians to play an active role in their children's online experience at all times. NWF does not knowingly collect any personal information from children below the aforementioned age and if NWF learns that NWF has inadvertently gathered personal data from children under the aforementioned age, NWF will take reasonable measures to promptly erase such personal data from NWF’s records.
We do not share children's personal information with anyone other than those who provide support for the internal operations of the Website and our agents (e.g., contractors who provide fulfillment services or technical support to the Website). Parents can review the information that we have collected from their children online, prevent the further use or maintenance of such information, or direct the deletion of their children's personal information by emailing us at this address: rangerrick@nwf.org.

Security Measures
We provide our visitors with a secure experience. Our technical security measures include industry standard SSL 2048-bit encryption with SHA-256 to secure the transfer of data between your web browser and our servers. Our web traffic is managed by a load balancer using Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2 to establish secure commination channels to distribute network and application traffic across a number of servers. TLS protects the confidentiality and integrity of the information being passes between systems. We adhere to industry standards for safeguarding the privacy of your personal information when interacting with our systems.
When users interact with sensitive information (such as a credit card number or personal identifiable information), that data is encrypted and is protected with the best industry standard encryption algorithm. While on a secure page, the lock icon in your web browser's Internet address bar becomes locked, indicting your connection is secure.
Please be aware that there are ongoing changes to security to social networking and third-party public access services that NWF may make available to you. You may choose to disclose information about yourself by contributing user generated content to these services. Any data that you disclose in forums, blogs, chats or social platforms carries no expectation of privacy or confidentiality. NWF is not responsible for any personal data you choose to make public.
NWF reserves the right to amend this policy at any time as needed. We will post changes here, so please check back periodically. Changes will take effect when posted, and your continued use of the site will constitute your agreement to the changes. Thank you.
