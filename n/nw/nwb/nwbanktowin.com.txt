Information We Collect Through Cookies and Similar Technology
Nationwide uses third party cookies, beacons, tags, and JavaScript to collect anonymous information and technical data, like your internet protocol (IP) address, operating system, and session ID. Nationwide shares this information with our business partners to manage our online advertising and to recognize visitors’ computers and devices. This allows us to render relevant Nationwide ads to you. This is referred to as behaviorally targeted or interest based ads. Our third party partners also use such technologies for website analysis and to manage the effectiveness of our ads placed on other websites. We do not store your name, address, telephone number, email address, or any sensitive personal information in these cookies and similar technologies. The companies that distribute our ads are only permitted to use or share your information for marketing Nationwide products and services.
Nationwide will share personal information with third parties only in ways that are described in this Privacy Policy. Each of the third parties that we use for our online marketing and tracking efforts should post a privacy policy that fully describes the advertising and data collection activities on their website. However, we cannot guarantee that all of these websites disclose this information.
We use Local Storage, such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences. Our business partners who provide certain features on our website or display advertising based upon your web browsing activity may also use HTML5 to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.

Public information
We may collect personal information about you, another insured on your policy, or a beneficiary when applying for a policy or service. We will only use this information for the specific reason for which it is provided.
If you apply for a product or service, we may collect information from your consumer reports, such as your credit report or motor vehicle report. We may use an "insurance score." An insurance score uses information from your credit report to help predict your future claims. Typical items that could affect an insurance score include payment history, number of revolving, new and collection accounts, bankruptcies, and foreclosures.
You may request the credit report source. Each Nationwide company has different contact information and instructions for requesting this information, so you will want to review the specific privacy policy for the Nationwide product you own. We have included links to these products and companies in the box labeled "Privacy Statement for Your Specific Product."
In rare instances, we may also need to collect your medical information from a medical provider. However, we will not use or share your medical information for marketing, unless you give us your permission.
We retain your personal information while your account is active or as needed to provide you services, such as quoting, re-quoting, and account management.

We may combine this data with information we already have about you, which allows us to update our records. Examples of the types of personal information that we may obtain from public sources or third parties may include change of address information from third parties for address standardization and correction.

As part of the SmartRide Program we may collect information about your vehicle, such as driving speed, trip information and geolocation. If you download and use the mobile app, we may collect information about your mobile device as well.

Confidentiality for Victims of Domestic Violence
New York State Insurance Law 2612 prohibits insurers from discriminating against victims of domestic violence. This law requires insurance companies to comply with valid orders of protection against an insured or anyone covered under an insured’s policy. While the order is in place, the insurance company is prohibited from sharing the address and telephone number of the protected persons, or of any person or entity providing covered services to the protected person. If a child is the protected person, the child’s parent or guardian must assert these rights.
Nationwide's Obligation
Except in instances where express consent of the requestor is given, Nationwide will not disclose to the policyholder or another insured covered under the policy the: address, telephone number or any other personally identifying information of the covered individual or children residing with the covered individual. Nationwide is also prohibited from disclosing any information relating to abuse including the nature of the health care services provided to the covered individual. This information could include the: name, address, and telephone number of the provider of the health care services; or any other information that could lead to the discovery of the above information.
Where applicable, you have the ability to further protect yourself by creating a new online account with new credentials and by placing your policy in your own name.
