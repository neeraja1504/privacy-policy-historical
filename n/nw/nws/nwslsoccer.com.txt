Does NWSL Collect Any Information About Users Under Age 13?
NWSL does not knowingly solicit or collect information from anyone under the age of 13, unless explicitly stated on a Site, and unless stated therein, all the Sites are directed at persons 13 years of age or older. If you are the parent or guardian of a child under the age of 13, or the legal age of contract majority, and have authorized your child to use your computer, NWSL urges you to instruct your child never to give out his or her real name, address, phone number, email address or other personally identifying information while on the Sites.  There are no computer applications on the Sites which allow for the determination of your age. If NWSL discovers that personal information of a child under 13 has been collected without parental or guardian consent, NWSL will take reasonable steps to delete this information. All information volunteered to NWSL will be treated the same as information given by an adult.  NWSL recommends that the Internet browsing behavior of any child should be carefully supervised by a responsible adult at all times.

These third parties may collect any of the types of information described in this Privacy Policy. NWSL’s third-party partners may combine information collected about you through your use of the Sites with information they collect through other websites, apps or services you use.

These third parties use cookies and other technologies to help analyze and provide NWSL the data. You consent to the processing of data about you by these analytics providers in the manner and for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.

What About Information Shared on Community Services ?
NWSL may make message boards, blogs, and other community services available to you on the Sites. Please understand that any information that is disclosed by you in these areas becomes public information.  When you disclose such information on a message board, blog or any other public forum, you do so at your own risk.  NWSL has no control over its use and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information or any other information about yourself.  The information presented in these areas reflects the views of the individual users or hosts and does not necessarily reflect the views of NWSL.  NWSL reserves the right (but has no obligation) to monitor the use of message boards, blogs or other public forums on the Sites.
Does NWSL Use De-Identified Information?
NWSL may take your Personal Information and make it non-personally identifiable, either by combining it with information about other individuals (aggregating your information with information about other individuals), or by removing characteristics (such as your name) that make the information personally identifiable to you (de-personalizing your information).  Given the nature of this information, there are no restrictions under this Privacy Policy upon the right of NWSL to aggregate or de-personalize your Personal Information, and NWSL may use and/or share with third parties the resulting non-personally identifiable information in any manner in NWSL’s sole discretion.
How Does NWSL Maintain and Secure the Personal Information NWSL Collects?
We make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct such data at your request if it is inaccurate or delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes.  If you wish to request the correction or deletion of such data, you may contact NWSL by email at privacy@nwslsoccer.com or by mail at:
NWSL Media, LLC
Attn: Privacy Request
1556 S. Michigan Ave., Floor 2
Chicago, Illinois 60605
Attn: General Manager
Please note in order to protect the security of your information, you will be required to properly identify yourself before NWSL can process such a request.
The security and confidentiality of your personal information is important to NWSL and NWSL will take reasonable measures to protect it, including measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, and disclosure.  These security measures include, for example, internal reviews of NWSL’s data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where NWSL store personal data.
When the use of a NWSL web page or app involves the transmission of Personal Information, NWSL may use Secure Socket Layer (“ SSL ”) technology to establish a secure connection between your computer or device and NWSL and/or the Sites.  NWSL may also allow the transmission of encrypted information from your computer or device to NWSL and back again.
NWSL reserves the right to monitor all network traffic to the Sites to identify and/or block unauthorized attempts or intrusions to upload or change information or cause damage to any of the Sites in any manner.  Anyone using any of the Sites expressly consents to such monitoring.
Please be aware that no data transmission over the Internet or which is stored on a computer connected to the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so while NWSL strives to protect your personal information, NWSL cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you voluntarily give to us.
Does NWSL Use Cookies?
When you visit or use the Sites, NWSL may place a cookie in a file directory on your computer or mobile device. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your computer or mobile device to uniquely distinguish your visit to a website or use of an online service or mobile application. The information that cookies collect includes the date and time of your visit and your registration information. Cookies may offer you many conveniences for NWSL’s Sites and allow NWSL to recognize certain information, such as your browser type, so NWSL knows if you can view certain plug-ins or extensions.  They also allow NWSL to streamline your visit to the Sites based on your previous visits.
Cookies may be either permanent or temporary.  NWSL may use both temporary and permanent cookies.  A temporary or “session” cookie is placed on your computer or mobile device during your visit to any of NWSL’s Sites and is deleted when you exit your Internet browser, the mobile application, and/or turn off your computer or device. A permanent or “persistent” cookie means that the cookie stays on your hard drive or mobile device until you delete it. You can delete NWSL’s permanent cookie at any time by following the instructions contained in your browser’s help file, or by contacting the company providing your browser’s or mobile device’s technical support.  NWSL does not use cookies to store information such as credit card numbers, social security numbers or any other highly sensitive Personal Information.
You may also be able to reset or restrict the advertising cookies contained on your device or in your internet browser by accessing the privacy settings for such device and/or browser. Please follow the instructions contained in your browser’s help file, or by contacting the company providing your browser’s or mobile device’s technical support to do so, such as Apple for iOS devices.
You may configure your browser or device to accept or deny cookies from the Sites.  However, disabling or denying cookies from the Sites may render parts of them inaccessible or may cause certain web pages or parts of the app not to properly load. There are also several services and websites which allow you to visit websites, including the Sites, anonymously. Again, you may not be able to access or use all of the content or services available on the Sites if you use these anonymizing services or websites.  If you change computers or browsers or devices, or use multiple computers or browsers or devices or delete NWSL’s cookies, you will need to repeat this process for each computer, each browser, and each device.
Does NWSL Use Web Beacons/Pixel Tags?
NWSL may use “Web Beacons,” sometimes referred to as “pixels,” “clear gifs,” or “web bugs,” which is another way (instead of cookies) to help personalize your experience on the Sites.  Web Beacons are typically invisible to you and are generally embedded in very small clear graphics files. “Pixel Tags” are small strings of computer code that provide a method for delivering a graphic image on a web page or other medium. Pixel Tags allow NWSL or a third party who serves the Pixel Tag, to set, read, and modify some of NWSL’s cookies.
NWSL may use Web Beacons and Pixel Tags to monitor certain non-personally identifiable information about you, including the URL of the page from which the Web Beacon or Pixel Tag originated, the type of browser used, the IP address of your computer and the time you viewed the Web Beacon or Pixel Tag. NWSL may also use Web Beacons and Pixel Tags to assist NWSL’s third-party advertising and/or content companies in providing the content they believe you want to see. Web Beacons and Pixel Tags are also used to allow such third parties to determine how many people view the advertisements and/or click through, and to assist in serving and managing advertisements and content.  While Web Beacons and Pixel Tags do not collect Personal Information, the information collected by them may be used in conjunction with Cookies to identify aggregate information about users of the Sites.
What Happens with Do Not Track Requests?
NWSL does not currently have the capabilities to recognize the Do Not Track signals from Internet browsers.  Therefore, any selection you make within your Internet browser will not be applied to the Sites.  For more information regarding Do Not Track you can visit www.allaboutdnt.org.
Links or Usage of Third Party Websites/App Stores
The Sites may contain links to third-party websites. NWSL has no control over the privacy practices or the content of such third-party websites. Neither NWSL, nor any of its officers, directors, partners, employees, agents, representatives, vendors or suppliers are responsible for the content, privacy policies, products, services, reliability, viewpoint or accuracy of information on any such websites.  NWSL does not control and is not responsible for the collection of personal information by third party websites, including websites owned or controlled by NWSL’s preferred financial partners, advertisers, vendors and/or websites not controlled by NWSL.
The app stores (e.g., App Store or Google Play) may collect certain information in connection with your use of the Sites, including Personal Information, geo-locational information, payment information, and other usage-based data. NWSL has no control over the collection of such information by any third-party app store, and any such collection or use will be subject to such third-party app store’s applicable privacy policy.
