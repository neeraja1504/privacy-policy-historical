9.     Links
Our websites may contain hyperlinks to other sites maintained by different organisations. We do not claim
any association with websites which are not clearly identified as our own and do not take any responsibility
for their content. Hyperlink users should observe such websites' terms of use, privacy policies and copyright,
which may or may not comply with the same privacy standards that we do.
10.    Access to your information
You may request access to any personal information we hold about you. The type of information you request
will determine the length of time we take to respond. We will generally respond using the same
communication method by which your request was originally made.
On occasion we will ask that you put your request in writing. This may include instances where you want
copies of material or access to archived information or if the nature of your application makes it necessary for
us to retain a record of your request.
You may be able to access some personal information via our customer service website. Access to personal
information via the customer service website requires the use of your unique user identification number and
password. No personal information is openly posted on the Internet. If you have difficulty finding the
information you want or in using the website, please contact us.
In some circumstances, we may charge an administration fee to retrieve your information, based on our
reasonable costs in providing the information to you. If we intend to charge an administration fee we will give
you an estimate of this fee so you can confirm you still want us to proceed with your request. We do not
impose any charge for submitting a request for access.
We are entitled to refuse you access to your information in certain circumstances. For example, you may not
be able to access personal information that would reveal personal information about another person, is
commercially sensitive material or we are prevented by law from disclosing. If this happens, we will provide
you with a reason for the refusal.
11.    What if the information is incorrect?
If you believe that personal information we hold about you is incorrect, incomplete or inaccurate, then you
may request that we amend it. We will generally correct the information upon request (or suggest alternative
arrangements for updating our records). If we do not agree that the information should be corrected, we will
provide you with a response stating the reasons.
12.    Cookies
We may collect personal information about you through the use of cookies. When you access our website,
we may send a “cookie” (which is a small summary file containing a unique ID number) to your computer.
This enables us to recognise your computer and greet you each time you visit our website without bothering
you with a request to register. It also enables us to keep track of products or services you view so that we
can send you news about those products or services. We also use cookies to measure traffic patterns, to
determine which areas of our website have been visited and to measure transaction patterns in the
aggregate. We use this to research our users’ habits so that we can improve our online products and

your browser so that your computer does not accept them.
