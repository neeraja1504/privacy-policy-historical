Privacy Policy
Last Updated and Effective Date - September 13, 2019
This Privacy Policy describes the manner in which NHL Interactive CyberEnterprises, LLC, and its affiliates, including NHL Enterprises, L.P., NHL Enterprises Canada, L.P., and the National Hockey League (collectively, the "NHL," "we," "our," "us") use information in operating our websites, our mobile and other apps, and any other online service that displays or provides an authorized link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the "Services").
The official sites and apps of the Member Clubs of the National Hockey League are part of the NHL.com website and the NHL mobile app ("Member Club Services").

The Member Clubs are responsible for their own privacy policies and practices, and you should review the applicable Member Club's privacy policy for information about its practices with respect to a Member Club Service.
By using our Services, you consent to the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at NHL.com/contact (and select "Privacy" in the subject line) or as described under Contact Us below.

We also may use the information we collect and receive for other purposes that may be described to you at the point of collection or for which you provide your consent.
** How We Share the Information We Collect and Receive**.
We may share information that we collect and receive with third parties when we have your consent or as described below.
We may share information with the following types of third parties:
Our affiliates. We may share information with current and future "affiliates", a term that includes our parent and subsidiary companies, joint venture partners, or other companies we control, are controlled by, or with which we are under common control.
Our service providers. We may provide information about you to service providers that perform certain functions or services on our behalf. For example, we may rely on service providers to host our Services and data, fulfill orders, provide products and services, manage databases, perform analyses or advertising services, administer our contests and sweepstakes, collect location data, provide location-based services, process credit card payments, provide customer service, or send communications for us.
Operational partners. We may, from time to time, partner with third parties to operate certain of our Services. From time to time, in accordance with applicable laws, we may provide information about you to these operational partners to use for their own purposes. For example, we partner with BAMTech, LLC ("BAMTech") to operate certain Services, and we therefore may share information about you with BAMTech, its successors and permitted assigns, and their affiliates in connection with the operation of our Services and where it is otherwise permitted by applicable law.
While these operational partners may use information about you to operate the Services, you should presume that these operational partners may use your information for their own purposes in accordance with their respective privacy policies. You can view a list of some of our key operational partners here.
Business partners. When you consent to receive news and offers from them, we may share information about you with select business partners that are not service providers, such as our sponsors, retailers, and broadcast partners, so that they can provide you with special offers, promotional materials, and other materials and information that may be of interest to you.
These other business partners are expected to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and security of any information we share with them. However, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of our business partners, which may use your information for their own purposes. You can view a list of some of our key business partners here.
Member Clubs. In addition to the information Member Clubs may collect about you in connection with your use of the Member Club Services, we may share information about you with our Member Clubs (including your contact information, demographic information, and information about your interactions with the NHL), and our Member Clubs may use this information for purposes including: providing you with special offers, promotional materials, and other materials and information that may be relevant to you, improving their products and services, and performing internal analysis. Please see the Your Choices  section for more information on the choices we provide you to limit the sharing of your e-mail address and other contact information with Member Clubs for promotional purposes. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of Member Clubs. You can view a list of our Member Clubs here.
Other parties in response to legal process or when necessary to protect us or our Services. We or our service providers may disclose your information -- including the contents of your communications -- to other parties when required or permitted by applicable law, such as when we have a good faith belief that:
Doing so is necessary to respond to lawful governmental requests or legal process (for example, a court order, search warrant, or subpoena);
The information is relevant to a crime that has been or is being committed;
An emergency exists that poses a threat to your safety or the safety of another person or persons; or
Doing so is necessary to protect our rights or property or to enforce our Terms of Service.
Other parties in connection with certain business transactions. In the event that the ownership of the NHL (or any portion of our assets) changes as a result of a merger, acquisition, or in the unlikely event of a bankruptcy, your information may be transferred to another entity. If such a transaction occurs, we will notify you in an update to this Privacy Policy or through another appropriate means.
Interactive features. We may share information with third parties when you post information to a public user profile or a public area of our Services, such as a chat room, forum, blog, or other community tool. If you post information to these interactive features, it will be publicly available and you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties. We cannot ensure that parties who have access to such information will respect your privacy. Please exercise caution when using these features.
We also may share other information with third parties in a manner that does not identify particular users, including, for example, aggregated information.

You also may be able to link an account from a social networking service to an account through our Services. This may allow you to use your credentials from such third-party service to sign in to certain features on our Services.

** Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Technologies**.
Our Services use online technologies called "cookies" and "web beacons," as well as other local storage technologies. This section explains what these technologies are and how they may be used.
Cookies and Other Local Storage Technologies
Generally speaking, "cookies" are text files that are placed in your device's browser, and that can be used to help recognize your browser across different web pages, websites, and browsing sessions. Your browser or device may offer settings related to cookies. For example, you may be able to configure your browser not to accept cookies or to notify you when a cookie is being sent. For more information about whether these settings are available, what they do, and how they work, visit your browser or device's help material. If you decide not to accept cookies from us, you may not be able to take advantage of all of the features of the Services.
Cookies are stored on your device or in "local storage." We also use other types of local storage technologies, such as Local Shared Objects (sometimes called "Flash cookies"), in connection with our Services. These technologies are similar to cookies in that they are stored on your device and can be used to maintain information about your activities and preferences.
However, these other local storage technologies may use parts of your device other than your browser, which means you may not be able to control their use using the browser tools and settings you use to control browser cookies. For more information about managing Flash cookies, please visit the Adobe Flash Player website. Your browser's privacy controls may enable you to manage other types of local storage.
Our Services may use cookies or other local storage technologies in combination with other information about you to enhance and personalize your experience on our Services (or elsewhere online), including:
to help authenticate you when you use our Services;
to remember your preferences and registration information; to enable a shopping cart;
to present and help measure and research the effectiveness of our Service, advertisements, and email communications (by determining which emails you open and act upon); and
to customize the content and advertisements provided to you through our Services and on other websites and services you visit.
** Web Beacons**
Web beacons are small pieces of code placed on Web pages, videos, and in emails that can communicate information about your browser and device to a server. Beacons can be used, among other things, to count the users who visit a Web page or read an email, or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a user viewing a Web page or email.
