Does Nuts & Bolts Speed Training share the information it receives?
Nuts & Bolts Speed Training may share your information: (i) with third parties who are under obligations of confidentiality with Nuts & Bolts Speed Training; (ii) if Nuts & Bolts Speed Training is required by law to do so; (iii) in the event of a transfer of ownership Nuts & Bolts Speed Training, merger or other similar transaction; or (iv) as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy. The following describes some of the ways that your information may be disclosed to third parties:
Our Service Providers.  We share personal information collected through our Sites with companies and organizations that perform services on our behalf, such as data storage, web hosting services, and order fulfillment companies. These companies and organizations are required by contract to use the personal information we share with them only to perform services on our behalf (and not for their own purposes) and to protect its confidentiality.
Our Successors.  We may transfer the personal information we collect through the Sites to another company (either an affiliate or an unrelated third party) that has acquired the assets of Nuts & Bolts Speed Training, for example, as the result of a sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or liquidation. If such a transfer occurs, the acquiring company will “step into our shoes” and collect, use and share your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Other Limited Circumstances.  There are other limited circumstances in which we may share the personal information in our databases with unrelated third parties. For example, we may disclose the personal information we collect through the Sites when we, in good faith, believe disclosure is appropriate to comply with the law or a regulatory requirement or to comply with a subpoena or court order; to prevent or investigate a possible crime, such as fraud or identity theft; to enforce a contract; to protect the rights, property or safety of Nuts & Bolts Speed Training, and visitors to our Sites, or to protect the vital interests of our visitors.
Marketing Purposes.  We rarely (almost never) share your personal information with third parties to use for their own marketing purposes. We pride ourselves on keeping your information private but we may occasionally share your personal information, if we think the products or services they offer would be of extreme interest to you. You may opt-out of receiving such communications at any time contacting us at info at Taylor@nutsandboltsspeedtraining dot.com or Camille@nutsandboltsspeedtraining dot.com
Third Party Sites.  You may visit other websites, through links on our Sites, which may collect, use and share your information in accordance with their own privacy policies. The information practices of those websites linking from or to our Sites are not covered by this Privacy Policy, and we encourage you to be very cautious before you disclose your information to others.
Accessing and Updating Your Information
You always have the opportunity to review and change the information you provide to us by contacting us at Taylor@nutsandboltsspeedtraining dot.com or Camille@nutsandboltsspeedtraining dot.com.
You may ask to have your account information removed from our active databases and to mark your information as “do not contact.” If you request to be placed on “do not contact” status, although your information will remain in our records, Nuts & Bolts Speed Training will not contact you for any of the purposes set forth in this Privacy Policy or otherwise. We prefer to retain your information and place your information in “do not contact” status rather than deleting your information entirely to ensure that the next time you contact Nuts & Bolts Speed Training, we do not add you to our mailing lists or otherwise contact you as described in this Privacy Policy. However, if you object to this practice and wish to instead have your information completely removed from our database, please send an e-mail to Taylor@nutsandboltsspeedtraining dot.com or Camille@nutsandboltsspeedtraining dot.com with a request that your information be deleted in its entirety rather than marked as “do not contact.”
We keep your personal information only as long as we need it for the purposes for which it was originally collected (or to which you have subsequently consented) or for other legitimate purposes (such as regulatory compliance), or as permitted by applicable law.
Security
We take reasonable precautions to: (i) protect the confidentiality and security of the personal information we collect through these Sites; (ii) ensure that your transactions on our Sites will be safe; and (iii) protect you from unauthorized credit card charges while you make payments on our Sites. Additionally, Nuts & Bolts Speed Training uses physical and electronic security measures to protect your information. However, it is important that you understand, that no website or database is completely secure or “hacker proof.”
Privacy Policy Changes
We are continually improving and adding to the functionality and features of the Sites. As a result of these changes (or changes in the law), we may need to update or revise our Privacy Policy. Accordingly, we reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy, at any time and without prior notice, by posting the revised version of this Privacy Policy on the Sites. Your use of the Sites following any such change constitutes your agreement that all personal information collected from or about you through the Sites after the revised Privacy Policy is posted will be subject to the terms of the revised Privacy Policy.
Transfer of Data Abroad
If you are visiting these Sites from a country other than the countries in which our servers are located (currently the United States), the various communications will necessarily result in the transfer of information across international boundaries. By visiting these Sites and communicating electronically with us, you consent to the processing and transfer of your data as set out in this Privacy Policy.
Governing Law
This Privacy Policy forms part of our Terms and Conditions and as such is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington in the United States of America without regard to conflicts of a law principles. You hereby consent and waive all objections to jurisdiction of the federal and state courts of the state of Washington and to venue therein.
