Cookies and Passive Data Collection
Nutshell automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, cookie information, and the page you request. Nutshell utilizes Google Analytics to analyze trends with non-personally-identifiable data.
Users should be aware that other websites visited before entering the Nutshell websites might place Personal Data within a User’s URL during a visit to their website, and Nutshell has no control over such websites. Accordingly, some of this information may be logged by Nutshell.
Links to Third Party Sites
Nutshell websites may contain links to other sites that are not under our control. These websites have their own policies regarding privacy. You should review those policies before visiting the websites. We have no responsibility for linked websites, and we provide these links solely for the convenience and information of our visitors.
Google Analytics
Nutshell uses Google Analytics to track usage of the Nutshell application and nutshell.com. Nutshell may use anonymized demographic and interest-based data from visitors to influence how we purchase advertising. Using the Ads Settings, users can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads.
We do not share any data that you add to your Nutshell account with Google.
Disclosures
Nutshell Service Providers
Nutshell uses certain third-party service providers to improve your experience. For example, when you file a support ticket, we will transmit a minimal amount of your Personal Data (e.g. your email address) to our support software provider. These third parties will be required to adhere to Safe Harbor Privacy Principles or, at a minimum, Nutshell will require the third party to certify they follow privacy protection equal to Nutshell’s.
Your credit card data is stored and processed with PCI-compliant providers.
Legal Requirements
Nutshell does not disclose Personal Data, including the data you enter or upload into the Product, unless disclosure is necessary to comply with an enforceable government request such as a warrant.
Change of Ownership
In the event of a change in ownership, or a direct merger or acquisition with another entity, we reserve the right to transfer all of Nutshell User information, including Personal Data, to a separate entity. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify you (by posting on www.nutshell.com or via an email sent to the email address you provide) of any change in ownership, merger or acquisition of Nutshell’s assets by a third party.
Security
All of your Personal Data, stored by Nutshell or otherwise, is considered confidential and private. Appropriate industry standard administrative, physical, and technical safeguards will be maintained by Nutshell to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.
Nutshell shall not: (a) Intentionally modify your Personal Data, (b) Disclose your Personal Data except as compelled by law or as expressly permitted in writing by you, or (c) Access your Personal Data except to provide maintenance, verification, or prevention of technical problems, associated with the Product or to provide technical support at your request.
Nutshell takes reasonable steps to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems but does not expressly make any guarantee these security measures will prevent third-parties from obtaining Personal Data by illegal actions or attacks. Should such an attack be perpetrated, Nutshell will supply authorities with available information on the third party when such event comes under prosecution.
Passwords
It is your responsibility to choose secure passwords and to keep them safe. Nutshell cannot be responsible for Personal Data that is compromised due to an insecure or stolen user password. If you are authenticating with Nutshell via a third-party (e.g. Google Apps), those passwords must also be secured.
