FREE WORLDWIDE SHIPPING
Many companies use shipping and handling fees to increase their profit margins, but here at Legion Athletics, we hate profit so our shipping is 100% free!
Okay, we don't exactly hate profit, but we do offer 100% free shipping to everywhere in the world because it makes people you like happy, and that makes us happy.
So, if you live in the United States, your order ships free regardless of order size , and if you live anywhere else, your order ships free when it’s over $99.
Why the restriction on international orders?
Unfortunately shipping outside of the US is very expensive and if we didn't require a minimum order size, we'd lose a lot of money. That said, most customers spend about $100 with us each time they shop, so this setup is a win-win.
