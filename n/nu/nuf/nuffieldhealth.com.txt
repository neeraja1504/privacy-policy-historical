How do we lawfully process your personal data?
Your personal data will be kept confidential and secure and will only be used for the purpose(s) for which it was collected and in accordance with this Privacy Policy, applicable Data Protection Laws, clinical records retention periods and clinical confidentiality guidelines.
Set out below are some of the ways in which we process personal data although to do so lawfully we need to have a legal ground for doing so. We normally process personal data if it is:
necessary to provide you with our services - to enable us to carry out our obligations to you arising from any contract entered into between us and you including relating to the provision by us of services or treatments to you and related matter such as billing, accounting and audit, credit or other payment card verification and anti-fraud screening

with your explicit consent for example: direct consumer marketing communications.
Generally, we will only ask for your consent to processing if there is no other legal grounds to process. In these circumstances, we will always aim to be clear and transparent about why we need your consent and what we are asking it for. Where we are relying on consent to process personal data you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us using the details below and we will stop the processing for which consent was obtained.
To process special category data we rely on additional legal grounds and generally, they are as follows:
With your explicit consent

This may also include monitoring whether the quality of our services or treatment is meeting expectations
It is necessary to establish, make or defend legal claims or court action
It is necessary so that we can comply with employment law
It is necessary for a public interest purpose in line with any laws that are applicable. This should assist in protecting the public against dishonesty, malpractice or other seriously improper behaviour for example, investigating complaints, clinical concerns, regulatory breaches or investigations e.g the Care Quality Commission or GMC or ICO.
Processing of personal data which you have made public:
As stated above, one of the legal grounds for processing data is where it is in our legitimate interest to do so, taking into account your interest's rights and freedoms. This allows us to manage the relationship that exists between you and us and can include the following reasons:

The security of your personal data ****
We protect all personal data we hold about you by ensuring that we have appropriate organisational and technical security measures in place to prevent unauthorised access or unlawful processing of personal data and to prevent personal data being lost, destroyed or damaged. We conduct assessments to ensure the ongoing security of our information systems.
Any personal data you provide will be held for as long as is necessary having regard to the purpose for which it was collected and in accordance with all applicable UK laws.
Personal data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside of the UK and the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Where we transfer your personal data outside the EEA, we will ensure that there are adequate protections in place for your rights, in accordance with Data Protection Laws. By submitting your personal data, and in providing any personal data to us, you understand the basis for this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
All information you provide to us is stored securely. Any payment transactions on our website will be processed securely by third party payment processors. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password that enables you to access certain parts of our website, you are responsible for keeping that password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.
The transmission of information via the internet cannot be guaranteed as completely secure.  However, we ensure that any information transferred to our websites is via an encrypted connection. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to minimise the risk of unauthorised access.
At your request, we may occasionally transfer personal information to you via email, or you may choose to transfer information to us via email.  Email is not a secure method of information transmission; if you choose to send or receive such information via email, you do so understanding the risks associated with doing so.
How long do we retain your personal data? ****
Unless we explain otherwise to you, we will retain your personal data on the basis of the following guidelines:
for as long as we have a reasonable business need, such as managing our relationship with you and managing our business
for as long as we provide services and/or treatment to you and then for as long as someone could bring a claim against us (in general this is a period of 8 years); and/or
in line with legal and regulatory requirements or guidance.
Disclosure of your personal data to third parties ****
In the usual course of our business we may disclose your personal data (which will be limited to the extent reasonably necessary) to certain third party organisations that we use to support the delivery of our services. This may include the following:
business partners, suppliers and sub-contractors for the performance of any contract we enter into with you,
organisations providing IT systems support and hosting in relation to the IT systems on which your information is stored,
third party debt collectors for the purposes of debt collection,
delivery companies for the purposes of transportation,
third party service providers for the purposes of storage of information and confidential destruction, third party marketing companies for the purpose of sending marketing emails, subject to having an appropriate lawful basis for such processing.

We may also disclose your personal data to third parties in the event that we sell or buy any business or assets or where we are required by law to do so.
Where you are a user of the Healthy U application, we share personal data with Vitality Healthy Workplace Limited, including:

details of your visits to Nuffield Health gyms
Special Category/Health information collected during provision of treatment or services ****
Special category data (including information relating to your health) will only be disclosed to third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy. That includes third parties involved with your treatment or care, or in accordance with UK laws and guidelines of appropriate professional bodies. Where applicable, it may be disclosed to any person or organisation who may be responsible for meeting your treatment expenses or their agents. It may also be provided to external service providers and regulatory bodies (unless you object) for the purpose of clinical audit to ensure the highest standards of care and record keeping are maintained.
_Medical professionals working with us:  _Medical professionals working with us We share clinical information about you with our medical professionals as we consider necessary for your treatment and care. Medical professionals working with us might be our employees, or they might be independent consultants in private practice. In the case of independent consultants, the consultant is the data controller of your personal data, either alone or jointly with us and will be required to maintain their own records in accordance with Data Protection Laws and applicable clinical confidentiality guidelines and retention periods. During your treatment pathway, Nuffield Health is required to create and maintain a single patient record, including a complete and accurate record of the care and treatment provided, for each of our patients. However, in certain circumstances a consultant may also create and maintain their own records. Where that is the case, we may refer you to that consultant to respond to and act on any requests from you to exercise your rights over your data, under Data Protection Laws. Our contracts with independent consultants require them to cooperate with those requests. In all circumstances, those consultants will only process your personal data for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy or as otherwise notified to you.
External practitioners : If we refer you externally for treatment, we will share with the person or organisation that we refer you to, the clinical and administrative information we consider necessary for that referral.  It will always be clear when we do this.
Your GP :  If the practitioners treating you believe it to be clinically advisable, we may also share information about your treatment with your GP.  You can ask us not to do this, in which case we will respect that request if we are legally permitted to do so, but you should be aware that it can be potentially very dangerous and/or detrimental to your health to deny your GP full information about your medical history, and we strongly advise against it.
Your insurer :  We share with your medical insurer information about your treatment, its clinical necessity and its cost, only if they are paying for all or part of your treatment with us.  We provide only the information to which they are entitled. If you raise a complaint or a claim we may be required to share personal data with your medical insurer for the purposes of investigating any complaint/claim.
The NHS :  If you are referred to us for treatment by the NHS, we will share the details of your treatment with the part of the NHS that referred you to us, as necessary to perform, process and report back on that treatment.
Medical regulators:   We may be requested – and in some cases can be required - to share certain information (including personal data and special category data) about you and your care with medical regulators who inspect our clinical facilities and standards. For example, if you make a complaint, or if the conduct of a medical professional involved in your treatment is alleged to have fallen below the appropriate standards, a regulatory body may wish to investigate. Regulatory bodies may include the Care Quality Commission, Health Improvement Scotland, Health Inspectorate Wales, the Regulation and Quality Improvement Authority for Northern Ireland, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HEFA), the General Medical Council or the Nursing and Midwifery Council.  Where access to personal data is granted, we always ensure that we do so within the framework of the law and with due respect for your privacy.
From time to time we may also make information available on the basis of necessity for the provision of healthcare, but subject always to patient confidentiality.
In an emergency and if you are incapacitated, we may also process your personal data (including special category data) or make personal data available to third parties on the basis of protecting your ‘vital interest’ (i.e. your life or your health).
We will use your personal data in order to monitor the outcome of your treatment by us and any treatment associated with your care, including any NHS treatment.
We participate in national audits and initiatives to help ensure that patients are getting the best possible outcomes from their treatment and care.  The highest standards of confidentiality will be applied to your personal data in accordance with Data Protection Laws and confidentiality. Any publishing of this data will be in anonymised, statistical form. Anonymous or aggregated data may be used by us, or disclosed to others, for research or statistical purposes.
Independent Healthcare Providers – Performance Information ****
In the interest in providing comparable clinical outcome and performance data to the public across independent sector providers in healthcare, we – like all independent hospital operators – are required by law to provide activity data, including some personal data, as set out in more detail below, for publication by The Private Healthcare Information Network (PHIN).
PHIN is responsible for collecting, processing and publishing information on the quality and cost of privately-funded healthcare in the UK.  The publication of this information is intended to:
provide GPs with reliable information to inform their decisions about which providers to choose
help future patients make informed choices about where to seek treatment
enable providers of care (hospitals and consultant clinicians) to improve the quality and safety of their services by better understanding their performance by comparison with other providers
to support regulator information to help identify any causes of concern
enabling them to target inspections and help ensure safer care for patients.
Providers must provide PHIN with details of each episode of care, including a summary of each record of treatment including; the dates when each patient was in hospital, what treatment was carried out and by whom.
Providers are also required to provide: patient satisfaction survey data, Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMS) – patient reported health improvements following treatment and details of any adverse events relating to the patients treated.
Certain personal data will be provided to PHIN, including patients postcode of residence. PHIN securely submits such data and records to information authorities such as:
for England, NHS digital;
for Wales, the NHS Wales Informatics Service;
for Scotland, the Information and Statistics Division;
for Northern Ireland, the Health and Social Care Board; and
for UK-wide mortality data, the Office of National Statistics.
PHIN will only disclose records of care and personal data to the non-departmental bodies/authorities identified above, as required by law or where there is an overriding public interest, and /or to investigate or prevent fraud.  Data Protection Laws give all individuals the right to make a ‘Subject Access Request’ to obtain a copy of any information that any organisation holds about them (as set out in more detail below).  As PHIN cannot identify individuals from the data it holds, applicants would need to provide further proof of identity in order to access whether it is possible to access any information held. Further information about how PHIN uses information, including its Privacy Notice, is available at: www.phin.org.uk.
National Data Opt-Out
The national data opt-out is an NHS Digital service which allows an NHS patient to opt out of their confidential patient information being used for research and planning.
