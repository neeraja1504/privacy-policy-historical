This information is available to you and other Website users through the people search on the Website.
We do not own, create, enter, filter, process or verify this information about people. We do not evaluate each entry and make no guarantees to you about the accuracy of any information or how recently any information was collected or updated.

We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with your Personal Data (since we do not collect it in the first place).

4. Cookies
Cookies are small pieces of data stored on your computer by websites including this one. Cookies usually contain anonymous information which can only be accessed by the website which placed it on your computer.
Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit the Website. Google Analytics uses only first-party cookies for data analysis. This means that the cookies are linked to a specific website domain, and Google Analytics will only use that cookie data for statistical analysis related to your browsing behavior on that specific website. According to Google, the data collected cannot be altered or retrieved by services from other domains. Basically, this cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google.
We do not use cookies to track your use of the Internet in any way or to store any Personal Data.
This Policy covers use of cookies only by Google Analytics and does not cover the use of cookies by any other third parties. We do not control when or how other third parties place cookies on your computer. For example, third party websites to which a link or advertisement points may set cookies on your computer. Some of these services may be used to track your behavior on other websites and we have no control over this.
You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to the Website by  disabling cookies on your browser.
If you choose, you can opt out by turning off cookies in the preferences settings in your web browser.
5. Use of Google Maps
We use Google Maps APIs to provide map information and photographic imagery. All the photos you can see on people search results pages are provided by Google Maps.
This Policy incorporates the Google Privacy Policy as amended by Google from time to time.

Third parties may collect your Usage Data. There are a number of places on or through the Website where you may click on a link to access other websites, services or web resources that are not affiliated or connected with us and do not operate under this Policy. For example, if you click on an ad or a link, you may be taken to a website that we do not control. These third-party websites may independently collect information, including your Personal Data, from you. We advise you to check the privacy policies of all third-party websites you visit.
We may allow third-party advertising companies or ad networks to display advertisements or place ad tags on the Websites. We do not provide any Personal Data to these companies.
