Sharing with third parties
Service providers: We work with third-party service providers to provide website and application development, hosting, maintenance, backup, storage, infrastructure, payment processing, analysis and other services for us, which may require them to access or use information about you. If a service provider needs to access information about you to perform services on our behalf, they do so under instruction from us, including abiding by policies and procedures designed to protect your information. You can learn more about third-party service providers on our Nuclino Subprocessors page.
Third-party services: You, your administrator or other Service users may choose to link or integrate third-party services with our Services. Doing so may give third-party apps access to your account and information about you like your name and email address, and any content you choose to use in connection with those third-party services. Third-party service policies and procedures are not controlled by us, and this privacy policy does not cover how third-party apps use your information. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of third parties before connecting to or using their services to learn more about their privacy and information handling practices. If you object to information about you being shared with these third parties, please disable or remove any undesired link or integration.
With your consent: We share information about you with third parties when you give us consent to do so.
Compelled disclosure: We reserve the right to use or disclose your Personal Information if required by law or if we reasonably believe that use or disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or comply with a law, court order, or legal process.
How we store and secure the information
Information storage and security
We use data hosting service providers to host the information we collect, and we use technical measures to secure your data. You can learn more about services we use on our Nuclino Subprocessors page. While we implement safeguards designed to protect your information, no security system is impenetrable and due to the inherent nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that data, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, is absolutely safe from intrusion by others. You can learn more about selected security measures here. We will respond to requests about information storage and security within a reasonable timeframe.
How long we keep information
We may retain your personal information for a period of time consistent with the original purpose of collection. For instance, we may retain your personal information during the time you have an account to use the Services, and for a reasonable period of time thereafter. We also may retain your personal information during the period of time needed for Nuclino to pursue our legitimate business interests, conduct audits, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
How to access and control your information

Other important privacy-related information
Notice to End Users
The Services may be adopted for both personal use and use by organizations. Where the Services are made available to you through an organization (e.g. your employer), that organization is the administrator of the Services and is responsible for the end-users and/or Service sites over which it has control. If this is the case, please direct your data privacy questions to your administrator, as your use of the Services is subject to that organization's policies. We are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of an administrator's organization, which may be different than this policy.
Age limitations
To the extent prohibited by applicable law, Nuclino does not allow use of the Services by anyone younger than 16 years old. If you learn that anyone younger than 16 has unlawfully provided us with personal data, please contact us and we will take steps to delete such information.

We may change this privacy policy from time to time. We will post any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice by adding a notice on the Services homepages, login screens, or by sending you an email notification. We encourage you to review our privacy policy whenever you use the Services to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.
