Internet Aspects:
Information may be collected when an Individual visits all websites of Nelson Education Ltd. ("Nelson Education Ltd. Sites"). Although the information collected, used or disclosed on the Internet as described below often does not constitute Personal Information (and to the extent that such is the case, then the obligations under the Privacy Policy do not extend to such information), Nelson Education Ltd. provides the details below about Internet aspects of Nelson Education Ltd. services for the purposes of disclosure about Nelson Education Ltd. services.
Internet Protocol Address (IP Address)
When an Individual's web browser requests a web page from another computer on the Internet, it automatically gives that computer the address where it should send the information. This address is called the computer's "IP address." For most users accessing the Internet from a dial-up Internet service provider (ISP), the IP address will be different every time the user logs on.
Nelson Education Ltd. may use the user's IP Address to:
facilitate the diagnosis and remedy of a technical problem reported by the user's or Nelson Education Ltd.'s technical team;
display (or allow the display by Third Party advertising providers of) more appropriate and relevant content and advertising, such as content and advertising based on the user's geographic area; and
estimate user traffic from specific countries or organizations. Many IP addresses are commonly associated with Internet service providers, universities, or major corporations in specific regions or localities. Aggregate information derived from IP addresses may also be reported to advertisers.
Cookies
A cookie is a small text file, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier that is sent to the user's web browser from a web site's computers and is stored on the user's computer's hard drive. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to a user's computer.
Nelson Education Ltd. may use cookies to:
improve the operation and performance of the Nelson Education Ltd. services and to make Nelson Education Ltd. services easier and more convenient to use. For example, cookies help Nelson Education Ltd. provide more personalized services by recalling user preferences on subsequent visits (e.g. language preference). Cookies also allow Nelson Education Ltd. to save passwords and preferences for a user so
that the user will not have to re-enter them on the next visit to a Nelson Education Ltd. Site;
measure aggregate user traffic and demographic statistics related to Nelson Education Ltd. services and advertisements (e.g. number of users, average time spent, average age and similar statistics). This information helps Nelson Education Ltd. to better understand when to update, change or offer new services and provides Nelson Education Ltd. with details as to the performance of Third Party advertisements and content. This information may be reported, in aggregate form only, to Nelson Education Ltd.'s current and prospective sponsors, advertisers and business partners. No Personal Information will be disclosed in such reports;
Nelson Education Ltd. and Third Party advertising providers may use cookies when serving advertisements on Nelson Education Ltd. Sites. In some cases, advertisements from Third Party advertisers are delivered to users (in conjunction with Nelson Education Ltd. services) by such Third Party advertisers, or by separately contracted advertising providers on their behalf, and not by Nelson Education Ltd.; as such, the Third-party advertisers' use of cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not the Privacy Policy, and users should consult the privacy policies of such Third Party advertisers.
Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If a user prefers, the user can reset his/her browser either to notify the user when the user has received a cookie, or to refuse to accept cookies. The user should understand that while Nelson Education Ltd. does not require a user to use cookies, certain Nelson Education Ltd. services will not function properly if a user sets his/her browser to not accept cookies. In most circumstances, the information captured cannot identify you as an Individual.
Tracking pixels consisting of a clear gif (also known as web beacons) are used in combination with cookies to help Site operators understand how visitors interact with their websites. A clear gif is typically a transparent graphic image (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel) that is placed on a site. The use of a clear gif allows the Site to measure the actions of the visitor opening the page that contains the clear gif. Nelson may use clear gifs on this Site, in our e-mails, or in our advertisements on other web sites. Nelson utilizes clear gifs to measure visitor behavior, to help us improve visitor experience, and to manage site content.
Nelson uses analytics technology to obtain information to improve the usefulness of the Site. We measure and analyze non-identifying, aggregate usage, and volume statistical information from Site visitors in order to administer the Site, and to constantly improve the quality of our service and site performance. Information gathered may include, but is not limited to, the following: the activity of the Site visitor's browser when the visitor is viewing the Site; the site path of visitors; general information regarding the visitor's internet service provider and host, and the time visitors come to the Site. Please note that this is not personal information, only general summaries of our visitors' usage of the Site.
Web Beacons
Certain Nelson Education Ltd. services may contain electronic images known as "Web beacons" - sometimes called single-pixel gifs - that allow Nelson Education Ltd. to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services.

Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the Web beacon resides. Certain Nelson Education Ltd. services web pages may also contain Web beacons placed there by Nelson Education Ltd.'s advertising partners to help Nelson Education Ltd. determine the effectiveness of Nelson Education Ltd.'s Internet advertising campaigns.
Links To Other Sites And Advertisements
A Nelson Education Ltd. service may contain links to other websites and services. While Nelson Education Ltd. tries to link only to sites and services that share Nelson Education Ltd.'s high standards and respect for privacy, a user should understand that Nelson Education Ltd. is not responsible for the content of, or the privacy practices employed by, other companies or websites.
