NEI Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy applies to information collected from users of NEI websites (“you” or “users”).  NEI currently collects several types of information from online users, including personal information that you voluntarily submit on publication order forms, meeting registration forms, newsletter or update service subscription forms, e-mails sent to NEI, or member registration forms and other information submitted for access to the Member Center section on our website.
To improve our website and services, we may automatically collect information when you visit, such as IP address or other unique device identifier; details about your browser, operating system, and hardware; any referring URL; and other logging information, such as the date and time of your visit and your activities on our website.  We also use technologies such as cookies, clear-gifs, and web beacons to collect information about website usage and any preferences that you set, so that we may customize your experience and further improve our services.
We use third party analytics tools, such as Google Analytics, that may track details about your online activities over time and across different sites.  These services provide demographic and user profiling information, and help us to improve our website and outreach services.  These analytics tools and services may also allow us and others to provide you with targeted advertisements or other content that you may be interested in based on your online activities.  You can learn more about Google Analytics and privacy here and your choices about Google ad settings here.
Personal Information:   Personal information that you voluntarily disclose to NEI either online or in writing through publication order forms, meeting registration forms, survey response forms, service enrollment or registration forms, or e-mail sent to NEI, is added to the relevant NEI database to enable our processing of orders or registration, to update our databases, to enable us to make appropriate responses, and to allow us to analyze and improve our efforts.  This information usually includes name, e-mail and/or physical address, item or service purchased or requested, meeting attended, or topic of interest, and may include credit card data if you place an order online.
NEI may send e-mails or other communications to you based on the information that you voluntarily submit to us.  On occasion, we also contract with third parties for co-marketing or other activities related to our goals and objectives, and allow them to use selected member or user information under strict confidentiality agreements.  NEI does not otherwise rent or sell e-mail addresses submitted to us.  NEI will not otherwise disclose its member or customer information to the government or other third parties, unless required by law.
Information provided to NEI in non-electronic form may also be used for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.  Individuals who would like to “opt out” of receiving additional communications from NEI should contact us to have their names removed from our lists. Corrections or other changes may also be made by contacting us using the information below.
NEI endeavors to take appropriate measures to assure the reliability of member records and to protect the personal information that we collect from unauthorized access, loss, misuse, or alteration.  We use commercially reasonable technologies, security measures, and other safeguards to protect member records and other personal information that we collect.
