Privacy Policy
Nerdbusiness.com is a blog by me, Derrick Schwabe. Privacy is a fundamental human right and I definitely support our right to privacy online. And so I am especially committed to ensuring the privacy of anyone visiting my blog.
This site does collect some information about its visitors. Here's why:
Website traffic
This kind of data is cool! Plus, it's nice to know how many people are visiting. I use a third party service which helps to track how many people visited. The service may use a "cookie" to collect this information upon each visit and may also collect the following information but not limited to: page URL, page title, referring source, user agent, IP address, language, hardware platform, OS, and screen resolution. If you prefer not to have this information collected, you may opt-out simply by visiting nerdbusiness.com with cookies disabled (you can disable cookies in your internet browser settings). This information will never be shared with anyone else for any purpose.
Feedback
If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy feel free to send a message.
Respectfully,
Derrick Schwabe
