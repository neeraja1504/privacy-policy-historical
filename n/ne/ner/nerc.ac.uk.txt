Privacy & cookies
Privacy policy
We collect information or data about you when you use this website.
This includes your computer's IP address and details about which web browser and device you are using (eg the version and screen size),Â and information on how you use this website, including the pages you visit, using analytics and cookies to help us improve the website.
This enables us to ensure this website works correctly for as many devices as possible, and we monitor the relative popularity of different parts of the site to ensure content is of interest and being accessed.
We cannot personally identify you with this information, unless you provide it yourself.
Storing your data
We will store your data to ensure an adequate level of protection for your data protection rights and freedoms. This sometimes may involve the use of assured third party systems.
Disclosing your information
We will not pass on your details to other providers, unless you give your consent for us to do so, and we will not share your information with any other organisations for marketing, market research or commercial purposes.
We may need to pass on your personal information if we have a legal obligation to do so.
Processing your personal data
We handle personal data in compliance with the Data Protection Act 1998, and recognise the importance of the correct and lawful processing of personal data in maintaining confidence in our operations.
Further information can be found in our information notice.
Cookies policy
When we provide services, we want to make them easy, useful and reliable. Where services are delivered on the internet, this sometimes involves placing small amounts of information on your device, for example, computer or mobile phone. These include small files known as cookies. They cannot be used to identify you personally.
These pieces of information are used to improve services for you through, for example:
enabling a service to recognise your device so you don't have to give the same information several times during one task
recognising that you may already have given a username and password so you don't need to do it for every web page requested
measuring how many people are using services, so they can be made easier to use and there's enough capacity to ensure they are fast.
You can use your web browser's settings to manage these small files yourself.
Our use of cookies
