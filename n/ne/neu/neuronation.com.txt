VIII. Use of cookies and analytics tools
1. Use of cookies
On our websites we use so-called cookies. Cookies are small files that are stored in the Internet browser on the user's device. This cookie contains a characteristic string that allows a clear identification of the browser when the website is called up again. In the used cookies no personal data is stored, so that we cannot draw conclusions about your identity by means of cookies. Only pseudonymized information is generated.
We use "session-based", temporary cookies: these do not remain on your computer. If you leave our pages, the temporary cookie will also be discarded. With the help of the gathered information we can analyze usage patterns and structures of our website and optimize the website by improving the content or the personalization and simplifying the usage.
We use cookies to make our website user-friendly and functional. Some elements of our website require that the calling browser be identified even after a page break.
When you visit our website, users are informed on the homepage by an info banner about the use of cookies and referred to this privacy policy.
2. Use of Google Analytics
We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc. (hereafter "Google"), for the purpose of designing and continuously optimizing our websites as required. Google is certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield Agreement and ensures compliance with European privacy legislation. When visiting the online portal, the following data will be collected and stored until automated deletion by Google without any action by the visitor as part of an automated procedure:
• the IP address of the requesting computer,
• the date and time of access,
• the name and URL of the retrieved file,
• the website from which the access was made,
• the operating system of the visitor's computer and the browser used by the visitor and other technical data,
• the visitor's internet access provider,
• Language settings,
• geographical location.
Google uses cookies, which are text files that are stored on the user's computer and that enable an analysis of the user's use of the Synaptikon online portal. The information generated by the cookie about the use of the online portal Synaptikon by the user is usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there.
However, in the case of the activation of IP anonymization on the website of Synaptikon, the IP address of Google will be shortened beforehand within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area.
On behalf of Synaptikon, Google will use this information to evaluate the use of the online portal, to compile reports on website activity and to provide other services related to website and internet usage to Synaptikon. The IP address submitted by Google Analytics within the framework of Google Analytics will not be merged with other data provided by Google.
The user can prevent the storage of cookies by a corresponding setting of his web browser software. Synaptikon points out to the user, however, that the user may not be able to use all the functions of NeuroNation in full.
Furthermore, the user can prevent the collection of the data generated by the cookie and its use of NeuroNation (including the IP address) to Google as well as the processing of this data by Google by the user using the browser available under the following link:
http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de.
Accordingly, the user has the opportunity to object to this data collection and use at any time. Google Analytics uses DoubleClick DART cookies and may use information about the user's visit to the NeuroNation website and other websites to display ads about products and services that interest users (interest-based ads). The information generated by the cookies about the use of NeuroNation, including the IP address, is transmitted to and stored by Google's servers. Google will also transfer this information to third parties if required by law or if third parties process this data on behalf of Google. Google declares that it will never merge or associate your IP address with other Google data. Google participates in the Safe Harbor program of the European Union and the United States. The information transmitted as part of this service does not include the user's name, address, e-mail address or telephone number.
If the user does not wish to use DoubleClick DART cookies, they may disable them through the Ads Preferences Manager at http://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/?hl=en.
3. Use of Google Adwords Conversion Tracking
To statistically record the use of our website and to evaluate our website for you and for marketing purposes, we also use Google conversion tracking. In doing so, Google Adwords will set a cookie (see paragraph 1) on your computer if you have reached our website via a Google ad.
These cookies lose their validity after 30 days and are not used for personal identification. If the user visits certain pages of the Adwords customer's website and the cookie has not yet expired, Google and the customer can recognize that the user clicked on the ad and was redirected to this page.
Every Adwords customer receives a different cookie. Cookies cannot be tracked via the websites of Adwords customers. The information gathered using the conversion cookie is used to generate conversion statistics for Adwords customers who have opted for conversion tracking. Adwords customers hear the total number of users who clicked on their ad and were redirected to a conversion tracking tag page. However, they do not receive information that personally identifies users.
If you do not want to participate in the tracking process, you can also refuse the required setting of a cookie - for example, via a browser setting that generally disables the automatic setting of cookies. You can also disable cookies for conversion tracking by setting your browser to block cookies from the domain "www.googleadservices.com".
4. Use of other analysis tools
In addition, we use the following additional web analytics services:
-New Relic for optimizing our websites
-Logentries, Logfiles, Firebase, Adjust and Google Tag Manager for statistical purposes
For this purpose, the providers of these analysis tools set cookies on users' devices, but do not store any personal data of users. We also use IP anonymization so that referencing a specific person is excluded. To disagree and remove cookies, please read the comments below under point 8.
5. Use of the customer support platform "Zendesk"
We use Zendesk's Zendesk web-based ticketing system, 1019 Market St., San Francisco, California 94103, USA ("Zendesk"), to provide you with effective customer support. We carefully control these external service providers and the processing of the data. Zendesk is certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield Agreement (https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000TOjeAAG). The service manages requests placed on our site. If you do not agree with Zendesk's data processing, alternative contact options are available, in particular by telephone or by post. When using Zendesk, the IP address and visited page are also recorded. The IP address is anonymized. Zendesk also uses cookies and similar technologies. The information generated by cookies on the use of this website (including the anonymized IP address) is transmitted to and stored by a Zendesk server in the USA. Performed chats are logged and saved. You can prevent the storage of cookies by setting your browser accordingly; However, we point out that in this case you may not be able to fully use all functions of our website.

When the user accesses a website of the NeuroNation online portal containing such a plugin, the user's web browser establishes a direct connection to the Facebook or Google servers. The content of the plugins is transmitted by Facebook or Google directly to the user's web browser and incorporated by the user into the website. NeuroNation therefore has no influence on the extent of the data collected by Facebook or Google with the help of this plugin, and informs the user according to his level of knowledge:
As soon as you call up one of our internet pages, which is provided with an activated plugin, a connection to the servers of the provider of the respective plugin is established. Both contents of the servers of the provider are loaded, as well as information transmitted to the provider. This information includes z. For example, your IP address and information about which page you have just visited. This happens regardless of whether you are logged in to the respective social network or not. If you are logged in to the respective network at the same time, the respective provider can identify you as a concrete user, because in addition to the address of the visited website, the date, time and browser-related information, your user ID will also be recorded. Logging out of the relevant network may prevent the assignment of the data to your user account. Alternatively, you can also prevent data transmission to the network by using special browser add-ons (eg Facebook blocker).
If you recommend content using the activated plugins, for example by clicking on a "Like" button, the corresponding information is transmitted directly to the respective social network and stored there as well. The data collected by the provider can be used to create usage profiles.
For more information on the collection and use of data by the provider of the plugins and your rights in this regard and ways to protect your privacy, see the privacy policy for
