We take reasonable administrative and technical steps to protect the Personal Data from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction and, where feasible, systems that solicit or display personally-identifiable information are protected by authentication and authorization controls and Web-based experiences involving personal information are generally secured by SSL (Secure Sockets Layer protocol) with 128-bit encryption. However, no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to protect your data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
RETENTION
We will keep your Personal Data pursuant to our retention schedules which authorize retention for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy Statement, while we have a legitimate business need to do so, or as required by law (e.g. for tax, legal, accounting or other purposes), whichever is the longer.
If you have elected to receive marketing communications from us, we retain information about your marketing preferences until you opt out of receiving these communications and in accordance with our policies.
To determine the appropriate retention period for your Personal Data, we will consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Data, the purposes for which we use your Personal Data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

PUBLICLY POSTED INFORMATION
This Privacy Policy does not apply to any information you elect to post to any public areas of the Site. This includes, but is not limited to, comments to Northeastern University blogs or forums.

DO NOT TRACK
Do-Not-Track is a public-private initiative that has developed a “flag” or signal that an Internet user may activate in the user’s browser software to notify websites that the user does not wish to be “tracked” by third-parties as defined by the initiative. The online community has not agreed on what actions, if any, should be taken by the websites that receive the “do not track” signal, and therefore Do-Not-Track is not yet standardized. Our website does not alter its behavior or change its services when it receives a “do-not-track” flag or signal from your browser.
FORWARDING EMAIL: STUDENTS’ PRIVATE EMAIL ADDRESS
If you forward email from your University-assigned email address to a private (non- Northeastern University) email address, we may send email to either or both addresses. We may also share your private email address with service providers inside and outside the University.
