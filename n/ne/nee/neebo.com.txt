Personal Information Use Neebo uses personal information provided by you so that we can service your account.

Neebo uses IP addresses to analyze trends in website usage, administer the site, track user’s movements throughout the website and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. Neebo will protect your privacy by NOT sharing your email address with anyone.

Age of Users The Site is targeted to college students. Individuals under the age of 18 (“Minors”) are not permitted to use the Site without the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by these Terms. If you are the parent or guardian agreeing to these Terms on behalf of a Minor, you are fully responsible for the Minor’s use of the Site, including all financial charges and legal liability that the Minor may incur. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from children under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register for an online account or to post personal information on our websites.

Supplemental Technologies Neebo’s website uses cookies, session identifiers, JavaScript™, and browser detection technology to provide consumers with a more pleasant online experience. Many browsers provide consumers with the ability to disable some or all of these technologies. Disabling them, especially in the case of JavaScript™, may prevent you from viewing some web pages. Note that the cookies we use do not place any personally identifiable information on your computer. Our site also does not participate in Ad Networks or use Web Bugs/Web Beacons to track consumer activity.
Confidentiality and Security Neebo takes reasonable steps to ensure that your information is protected. On our website, we use industry standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption when collecting your personal information. Our website is hosted in a data center which makes use of multiple levels of redundant firewalls and database encryption to protect information. Internally, we limit access to your information to those employees or agents who we believe have a reasonable need to use the information to provide products or services to you, or to perform their jobs.
Secure Online Ordering We have gone to great lengths to protect the security and validity of your credit card transaction. Our order forms are encrypted by our secure server to guarantee that the information can be read by us only. It will appear as indecipherable gibberish if the data is intercepted by an unauthorized source. We use the process developed by Mozilla-SSL (Secure Socket Layer)-to guard information. SSL is the industry standard for online security. Today's web browsers support this protocol, including Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer and others. Before a business can use SSL, it must be certified by an independent authority. This trusted third party will determine if the business is legitimate. VeriSign, one of the largest such companies in the world, certified us.
How to Tell It's Secure There are a couple of ways to tell if the information you are receiving is coming from a secure server.
Check the security icon. Most browsers use a key (Firefox) or padlock (Microsoft Internet Explorer). An unbroken emblem indicates a secure browser.
Check the URL field of your browser. With a secured server the address will begin with https:// instead of the usual http://.
Notifications When your order is placed on our website we will send you an email notification. When your order status changes you may also receive notifications via email. These notifications are considered part of our service and may not be disabled. We will send the email but we cannot guarantee delivery. You are responsible for providing a valid email address and for updating it when your address changes. Neebo may, depending on the importance and urgency of the notification, choose to contact you via telephone or postal mail. When doing so, we will use the phone number and/or address associated with your account or transaction.
