This Online Privacy Statement covers the collection and use of data on the www.necdisplay.com Web site in the United States.
What Information We Collect
The information we collect on our Site generally falls into the following two categories: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information.
Personally Identifiable Information: This refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are. The Personally Identifiable Information we collect when you use our Site may include your name, mailing address, phone number, e-mail address, employer, credit card number and its expiration date, shipping address, public postings, prospect email address, and job title. We request Personally Identifiable Information when you order a product or service, participate in certain online promotional activities, fill out online surveys, register a product online, request technical support, and correspond with us. We also collect Personally Identifiable Information when you ask that we send products or information directly to other people; in these cases, we will collect the information you submit about the recipient.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information: This refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual. The non-personally identifiable data we collect when you visit our Site may include the Uniform Resource Locator, i.e. the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web, ("URL") of the Web site that you came from before visiting our Site, which pages you visit on our Site, which URL you next go to, which browser you used to come to our Site, your Internet Protocol ("IP") address, and any search terms entered on our Site. This Statement also contains more information about how we use cookies and other technology to collect data.
Why We Collect Your Information
Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide customers with superior service and to provide all visitors a smooth, efficient, and personalized experience while using our Site. For example, if you purchase products or supplies, or request information on our Site, we use your Personally Identifiable Information to fill your order or to provide you with the requested information. We may use Non-Personally Identifiable Information to analyze customer behavior to help us understand how visitors use our Site and to measure interest in the various pages. We use this information to improve the content of our Site, to make our Site easier to use, and to customize our advertising.
We do not connect the Personally Identifiable information and Non-Personally identifiable information that we collect on our Site.

Sharing Your Information
We only share your Personally Identifiable Information outside the NEC family of companies if it is required by law, or to protect NEC Display Solutions, its customers, or the public, or with companies that help NEC Display Solutions fulfill its obligations with you, and then only with partners who share NEC Display Solutions' commitment to protecting your privacy and data. Except as previously stated, we do not sell, trade, or rent to others the Personally Identifiable Information we collect online. Where NEC Display Solutions engages third parties to perform services on our behalf, we will require them to observe the intent of this Online Privacy Statement.
Personally Identifiable Information previously collected by NEC Display Solutions may be transferred to any new corporate entity formed as a result of corporate reorganization of NEC Display Solutions, or any of NEC Display Solutionsâ€™ divisions, provided that such new corporate entity agrees to abide by the terms of this Privacy Policy.
From time to time, we may be required to provide Personally Identifiable Information in response to a court order, subpoena, or government investigation. We also reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful. We may release certain Personally Identifiable Information when we believe that such release is reasonably necessary to enforce or apply our Terms of Use or to protect the rights, property, and safety of others and ourselves.
Your Choices
NEC Display Solutions will not use or share the Personally Identifiable Information collected on our Site in ways unrelated to the purpose for which you provided the information, including those described in Section titled "How We Use Your Information ", without providing you a choice whether to permit any such unrelated uses. At the time you provide your information, we will offer you a choice as to whether you want to receive ("opt-in") further communications about special offers, product information or other marketing messages. If you choose not to receive these communications ("opt-out"), we will not use the information you provide for this purpose. You can opt out at any time as all e-mail communications from us, such as newsletters, tell you how to stop receiving them. Please follow these instructions if you no longer wish to receive the e-mail messages.
You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by sending us a request that credibly shows error. To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.
