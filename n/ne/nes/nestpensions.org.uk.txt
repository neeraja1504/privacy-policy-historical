Privacy policy
National Employment Savings Trust (NEST) Corporation ('we' or 'us') takes your privacy seriously. Please read this Privacy policy, our privacy information notices below, help areas (when interacting with our website) and our Cookies policy. Together they explain our data protection policy and describe how we’ll use any personal data we collect from you or that is provided to us.
In May 2018 the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 and the Data Protection Act 2018 (jointly referred to as ‘Data Protection legislation’) came into force.

More information on this can be found in the relevant individual privacy information notice below.
NEST Corporation is registered with the Information Commissioner’s Office (Registration number: Z2343426).
Our Data Protection Officer is our Chief Risk Officer, whose office can be contacted at dpo@nestcorporation.org.uk.
