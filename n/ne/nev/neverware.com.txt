Privacy — Neverware
Our Privacy Policy Summary
At Neverware, your privacy is critical to us. We prize transparency as one of our core company values; accordingly, we strive to be as transparent as possible about the personal information we collect and how we use it. Updates in this version of the Neverware Privacy Policy reflect recent changes in data protection laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
Our policies for privacy and data protection can be summarized as:
We only collect data in order to improve the customer experience for Neverware’s products and services.
We will never sell any of your personal data.
When your data is shared with third-party tools and services, it remains under Neverware’s control.
Our goal is to meet or exceed the legal requirements for personal protection in any jurisdiction, and to provide all users and customers the same rights.
What This Policy Covers
This policy is intended to help you understand:
What information we collect about you
How we use the information we collect
How we share information we collect
How long we keep this data
How to access and control your information
This Privacy Policy covers the information we collect about you when you use our websites, products or services, or otherwise interact with us (for example, by registering for our online events or downloading our content), unless a different policy is displayed. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into, and considered a part of, the Neverware Terms of Service, currently located at https://www.neverware.com/tos.
Please also note that co-branded websites (websites where Neverware presents content together with one or more of our business partners) may be governed by additional or different privacy statements. Please refer to the privacy statement on those websites for more information about applicable privacy practices.
This policy also explains your choices regarding how we use information about you. Your choices include how you can object to certain uses of information about you and how you can access and update certain information about you. If you do not agree with this policy, do not access or use our products or services or interact with any other aspect of our business.
The Personal Information We Collect
1. CloudReady Operating System
CloudReady is provided to users and customers for use on their own devices as a full operating system. In this section, “CloudReady OS” refers to that OS once you have started using it on your device.
What data CloudReady OS collects and what we use it for:
Hardware Info: We collect data about the devices you run CloudReady OS on, including the names, manufacturers, and capabilities of each computer and its components. We use this info to provide a unique ID for licensing purposes (on CloudReady Education and Enterprise Editions), to estimate the volume of total CloudReady users at any time, and to better understand and improve CloudReady's compatibility with different hardware.
Startup and Login Metrics: Neverware tracks the frequency with which CloudReady devices are powered on or logged in, and pairs that with info about the version of CloudReady a device is running. This info allows us to estimate the total number of CloudReady users over any given time span, and to infer the stability of CloudReady in conjunction with hardware data.
Feature Info: Neverware also collects data about your use of some specific features like Flatpaks applications and Docker (currently only on the Home Edition of CloudReady).
Personal privacy and opting out on CloudReady OS:
Personal Privacy: Hardware and usage data are only tied to your device’s identity. No personally identifiable information is collected. For Home Edition users, hardware identity is pseudonymized using a cryptographic hash to ensure anonymity.
Opting Out: All collected data is required by Neverware to be able to enforce licensing and provide support on CloudReady Education and Enterprise Editions. Users of the Home Edition can opt out of sending data at any time in their CloudReady settings menu.
How long we keep the data that CloudReady OS collects:
CloudReady OS does not collect any personally identifiable information, and as such, Neverware retains the above device information indefinitely for the purpose of historical reporting.
2. CloudReady feedback tool
The CloudReady feedback tool sends robust system logs to Neverware, at a user’s discretion, in the case of disruptive OS errors such as kiosk app failures, licensing issues, sign-in errors, or any time a user manually selects “Report an issue” in the browser settings menu.
What data the CloudReady feedback tool collects and what we use it for:
System Logs: We collect a full suite of system logs from your CloudReady device when you send us information using the feedback tool. For an example of what data is contained in these logs, visit this knowledge base article. We use this broad set of data to provide our support and engineering team as much context and information as possible when addressing the problem that initiated the CloudReady feedback tool’s use.
Personal privacy and opting out of the CloudReady feedback tool:
Personal Privacy: System logs redact all your personally identifiable information except your email address, should you choose to include it.
You can view the logs you have sent to Neverware by sending a request to [email protected]. Education and Enterprise users can also visit my.Neverware.com to access their site’s logs.
Opting Out: If you do not want to share system logs with CloudReady, you are not required to send us system logs. You can cancel or avoid any sending of logs by never pressing “alt+shift+i” when using CloudReady, never selecting “Report an issue…” from the CloudReady settings menu, and cancelling any prompt that asks you to send logs.
Note that some OS functionality is not possible if you choose not to send us logs. Licensing errors can only be resolved by sending Neverware logs or by contacting our support team, so that the issue can be understood and resolved. If you experience a licensing error and choose not to send logs, you will not be able to proceed using CloudReady.
How long we keep the data that the CloudReady feedback tool collects:
Neverware retains logs you send us for 30 days by default. If your logs are relevant to an ongoing investigation or improvement, we retain these logs for the duration of the work they are relevant to.
You can request to have your logs deleted by sending a request to [email protected].

provide you with a copy of your Personal Data that we hold
update any inaccuracies in the Personal Data we hold
delete Personal Data we no longer have grounds to process
restrict how we process your Personal Data while we consider an inquiry you have raised

lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority
object to any processing of Personal Data that we process on the “legitimate interests” or “public interests” grounds, unless our reasons for the underlying processing outweigh your interests, rights and freedoms; and

transfer your information to another provider, known as the right to data portability
If you would like to exercise these rights, email us at [email protected]. We will endeavor to respond without delay.

Should this be necessary, we will explain the reasons why.
These rights are subject to certain exemptions to safeguards to safeguard the public interest (e.g., the prevention or the detection of crime) and our interests (e.g., the maintenance of legal privilege). We will respond to most requests within one month.
If we are unable to resolve a query or a complaint, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with the data protection regulator/ supervisory authority in the country in which you are based.

Fair Information Practices
The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.
In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices, we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:
We will notify you via email within 20 business days
We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
