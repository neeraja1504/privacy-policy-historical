Here is our complete privacy policy:
This privacy policy applies to all products created by News360 Inc.
Information that we collect and how we use it
We may collect the following types of information:
Information you provide when you sign up for News360, like your name, email and other personal information. This may be entered directly, or submitted through a third party account you use to login (i.e. your Facebook or Twitter account).
Cookies - we use cookies to keep you logged into News360 when you use our web services.
Log information - when you access News360 through a browser or via one of our applications, we may automatically log the browser version, browser language, Internet
Protocol address, date and time of your request, and what type of device you are using.
User communications - when you send us email or other communications, we may keep your communications on file in order to respond to you and improve our products per your feedback.
Location data - News360 provides local news as part of its services. This means that we have to discover and process your coordinates, or coordinates of the city you explicitly specified in the settings of the app. If you do not use the local news feature, we do not collect your coordinates.
Unique device identifier - When you use any of the News360 apps, we use the UDID of your device to give you persistent settings and service - this number usually cannot be used to identify your person and is not connected to your personal information, other than the information you explicitly provide to us.
Advertising identifier - On some mobile platforms, News360 uses the advertiser identifier instead of the UDID, for example on Android, we use the Android Advertising ID. This is used for usage statistics, analytics and to serve promote stories.
