Cookies and IP addresses
Cookies are pieces of information that a web site transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes.

We also use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer the Site. NewTab.club will not use your IP address to attempt to identify you personally, nor to build a profile concerning who you are and what you search through our Site, otherwise that to provide you with the services and subscriptions that you request through registration or use of the Site.
