Personal Information Received from the EU/EEA and/or Switzerland
Personal information is transferred to Newswire in the US from the EU under one of the following scenarios:
Processor : Newswire is a provider of software, services and tools intended to help customers manage all aspects of their marketing and PR campaigns. Newswire does not own or control any of the information it processes on behalf of its customer. All such information is owned and controlled by Newswire’s customer. In this capacity, Newswire receives information transferred from the EU to the US merely as a processor on behalf of its customer, although such information may not be required by Newswire.
Data Controller : Newswire also provides information products designed to help customers research and plan their campaigns more effectively. In this function, Newswire acts as a data controller of the personal information contained in these products and processes this personal information as described in this Policy in the US, a country that does not have the same level of protection for personal data as the EEA or Switzerland. Newswire maintains a media database containing personal information on EU media contacts, and such individuals can have such information removed from our database. This information does not include sensitive information such as data about race, sexual orientation, or religion. This information is transferred to the US on the basis of consent, or European Commission-approved standard contractual clauses, and may be further transferred to our customers and to third party service providers located in Asia, Latin America and the Middle East, which do not have the same level of protection for personal data as the EEA or Switzerland, for the purposes described in this Policy.
