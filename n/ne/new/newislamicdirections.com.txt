Why we collect personal information
New Islamic Directions collects and uses your personal information to give you superior customer service, to provide you with convenient access to our products and services, and to make a wider range available to you. In addition, we use your personal information to keep you up to date on the latest product announcements, new and events updates, special offers, and other information we think you would like to hear about. This may occasionally include information from other organizations about events and updates that are related to New Islamic Directions. From time to time, we may also use your personal information to contact you to participate in a market research survey, so that we can gauge customer satisfaction and develop better products.
How we collect personal information
We collect information about you in several ways. For example, we might ask for your contact information when you correspond with us, call us to make a purchase or request service, register to attend a seminar, or participate in an online survey. In addition, when you register a new NID product, or ask to be included in an email mailing list, we collect and store the information you provide in a secure database.
To save you time and make our web services even easier to use, some areas of the NID website allow you to create an “NID ID” using your personal information. Here iss how it works: Simply fill out a brief profile with your name, phone number, and email address, then choose a password and password hint (such as the month and day of your birth) for security. The system saves your information and assigns you a personal NID ID. Next time you order something from the NID Store or register a new product, you can simply enter your NID ID and password thesystem will automatically look up the information it needs.
When we disclose personal information
If you check “I agree to the use of my personal data” the box during registration, NID will share you personal information with organizations it works with.
How we protect your personal information
NID safeguards the security of the data you send us with physical, electronic, and managerial procedures. We urge you to take every precaution to protect your personal data when you are on the Internet. Change your passwords often, use a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure browser.
The NID Store uses industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption on all web pages where personal information is required. To make purchases from the NID Store, you must use an SSL-enabled browser such as Internet Explorer 6.0 or later, or FireFox. This protects the confidentiality of your personal and credit card information while it is transmitted over the Internet.
