How We Secure the Information We Collect From or About You
TNR has technical and organizational security measures in place, including firewalls, to protect the information under our control from accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access. Such measures do not guarantee prevention of loss, misuse, or alteration of information, however, so while we strive to protect your information, TNR cannot warrant the security of information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. We comply with generally accepted industry standards in collecting and processing credit card information. However, TNR does not guarantee the safety of credit card information over the internet.
