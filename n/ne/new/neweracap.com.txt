Children's privacy
New Era realizes that children may visit this website, and New Era encourages children to consult with their parents before submitting any information to any website, including ours. However, New Era believes that it is ultimately the parents' responsibility to supervise their children's online activities and consider using parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers that help provide a kid-friendly online environment. These tools can also prevent children from disclosing their names, addresses, and other personally identifiable information online without parental permission. New Era will not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13 without first obtaining parental consent. If a child under 13 submits personal information to New Era and we learn that the information is from a child under 13, we will attempt to delete the information as soon as possible.
Security policy
This website takes precautions to safeguard your information. When users submit information via the website (for example, when our registration/order form asks you to enter sensitive information such as credit card number and associated information), that information is encrypted and is protected with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption. .In addition, McAfee Secure scans this website for new Vulnerabilities and complies and strictly enforces all PCI-DSS standards. You can help us by also taking precautions to protect your personal information when you are using the internet. For example, you should change your passwords often using a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure you use an SSL-enabled browser.
No security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot guarantee that only authorized persons will view your information. We cannot ensure that information you share on the Site will not become publicly available. We are not responsible for third party circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures on the Site. You can reduce these risks by using common sense security practices such as choosing a strong password, using different passwords for different services, and using up to date antivirus software.
