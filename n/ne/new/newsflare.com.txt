Anonymous data collected through this website
In addition to the information we collect as described above, we use technology to collect anonymous information about the use of our website. For example, we use technology to track which pages of our website our visitors view. We also use technology to determine which Web browsers our visitors use. This technology does not identify you personally; it simply enables us to compile statistics about our visitors and their use of our website.
We use this anonymous data to improve the content and functionality of our Website and our e-mail updates, to better understand our customers and visitors, and to improve the services we offer.
Cookies
To collect the anonymous data described in the preceding paragraph, we may use temporary "cookies" that remain in the cookies file of your browser until the browser is closed. Cookies by themselves cannot be used to discover the identity of the user. A cookie is a small piece of information which is sent to your browser and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies do not damage your computer. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. This enables you to decide if you want to accept it or not. We also use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website. An IP address is a numeric code that identifies your computer on a network, or in this case, the Internet. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information, such as determining how many of our visitors are from outside of the UK. We may also perform IP lookups to determine which domain you are coming from (i.e: aol.com, yourcompany.com) to assess our users' demographics more accurately.
Disclosure of your personal data
We do not share with, nor sell, nor distribute your personal data to unrelated third parties, except under these limited circumstances:
personal data may occasionally be transferred to third parties who act for us for further processing in accordance with the purposes for which the data was originally collected, or for purposes to which you have consented or otherwise in accordance with this Privacy Policy. For example, sometimes a third party may have access to your personal data in order to support our information technology or to handle mailings on our behalf.

Please note that payments made by third party payment providers may also be subject to additional policies.
Unless you have given us your consent to the processing of your personal data in accordance with our Privacy Policy (which includes sharing or other disclosing), we will not share or disclose your personal data to any unrelated third parties for their own marketing purposes.
We may share or transfer the information in our databases to comply with a legal or regulatory requirement, for the administration of justice, interacting with anti-fraud databases, to protect your vital interests, to protect the security or integrity of our databases or this website, to take precautions against legal liability, or in the event of our sale, merger, reorganisation, transfer of business, dissolution or similar event.
If we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets, but only once such transaction has gone through.
Where appropriate, before disclosing personal data to a third party, we require the third party, contractually, to take adequate precautions to protect that data and to comply with applicable law.
Data Integrity and Security
We strive to maintain the reliability, accuracy, completeness and currency of personal data in our databases and to protect the privacy and security of our databases. The security measures in place on our website and computer systems, aim to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of the information you provide to us. We keep your personal data only for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes for which it was collected or to comply with any applicable legal or regulatory requirements, or our data retention policy.
We urge you to protect your own privacy. We recommend that you do not share your password with anyone or share your password in an unsolicited phone call or e-mail.
Unfortunately, despite all of our efforts, there is always a risk that third parties may unlawfully intercept transmissions. For example, we cannot ensure the security of your data during transmission to us or the security of your data on an iPhone, Android (or other telephone device that can use phone applications) or on another computer. This reality is true of all Internet or data transmission use. As a result, we cannot ensure the security of any information you transmit, and you transmit all information at your own risk. We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
Location-Based Services
When you upload videos, data and/or images ("Content") using the Newsflare App on a device, we collect location information. We collect two forms of location data, in both instances pertaining to the Content you submit: (i) GPS Geographic Location Data from the App installed on your device(ii) Image File Data: we collect EXIF file metadata, this metadata is usually automatically tagged to your Content. We collect and use both of these two sources of location information to verify the geo-location of the Content you submit, we also pass this information to our third party media buyers for the same purpose. We obtain your consent to collect this data on the registration page of our website, and on the first instance you use the Newsflare App on your device.
