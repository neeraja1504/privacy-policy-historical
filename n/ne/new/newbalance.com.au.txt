Privacy Policy
Last Updated: February 1, 2019
Thank you for placing your trust in New Balance. You are very important to us and we want to provide you with a safe and secure online experience. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect and use your information and explains the choices that you have with regard to how we use your information.
New Balance is bound by the Australian Privacy Principles in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) ("the Privacy Act").
This Privacy Policy applies to the following services operated by New Balance Australia Pty Ltd and its affiliates ("New Balance", "we", "us", or "our"):
www.newbalance.com.au (the "Website");
all mobile applications (each, an "App") that contain a link to this Privacy Policy;
all services made available by New Balance through the Website and the Apps; and
the Stride I.D. Experience made available by New Balance in selected stores.
For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, the foregoing are referred to, collectively, as the "Service".
This Privacy Policy applies whether you are a "Visitor" (which means that you simply browse the Service) or you are a "Member" (which means that you have registered or transacted with the Service or a component thereof). By accessing or using the Service and providing us with information through the Service, you consent to this Privacy Policy. We suggest that you review this Privacy Policy periodically as we will update and change it from time to time.
At the time personal information is collected, New Balance will take reasonable steps to inform individuals about the purpose for which the information is collected, the customer's right to access the information and other matters contemplated in the Australian Privacy Principles regulating collection of personal information.
WHAT INFORMATION DOES NEW BALANCE COLLECT ABOUT ME?

When you access, visit and/or use our Website or one or more of our Apps, we may track your visit and, as described below in the section concerning "cookies", collect certain data regarding your use of the Service and your activity on the Service, but we will not collect any Personal Information from you unless you choose to provide it to us.
We use third party analytics tools, including those offered by Google, Inc. ("Google") and Adobe Systems Incorporated ("Adobe"). These third party services use cookies to help us analyse how users use our Website and our Apps. The information generated by the cookie about your use of our Website and our Apps (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google and Adobe, respectively.

New Balance Stride I.D. Experience information
The New Balance Stride I.D. Experience features scan technology provided by our technology provider Volumental that uses infrared imaging to create a three-dimensional (3D) image of your feet and collects key measurements about you and your feet, including your gender, foot length, foot width, arch height, strike, flexibility and foot size. The scan technology also creates a shoe profile including foot size and foot width in order to generate a 3D mesh image of your feet (i.e., your 3D foot scan). The scan technology can also be combined with gait analysis technology, which involves conducting a video analysis of your feet as you run to measure your gait.
We also collect information about the shoe model you try on and if you make a purchase. Together, this information is used to help us provide a better fit recommendation matched to your needs and find the perfect shoes to optimise the performance of athletes.
Where you elect to receive a copy of your 3D foot scan (and where applicable a snapshot image from your gait analysis video) we also collect your name, email address, telephone number and age range and retain this information with your Stride I.D. and gait measurement metrics. If you elect not to receive a copy of your 3D foot scan image, we will retain only the resulting measurement data from which we cannot identify you. We retain this information in order to better understand and improve how our products fit. We share the measurement data (but never your contact information) with Volumental, who use this information to improve their scanning technology. Volumental also retains the raw infrared images from your scan and the resulting 3D mesh image (from which you cannot be identified) for the same purpose of improving their foot scanning technology to offer customers best fit solutions. We never retain or share with any third party any images from your gait analysis video.
Personal Information
In general, you can visit our Service without providing us with any personally identifiable information, such as your name, email address, postal address, phone number, gender, credit card information or other information necessary to process your order (all such personally identifiable information, collectively, "Personal Information"). However, in order to place an order or use certain services and features made available through our Service, you will be required to provide certain Personal Information.
When you make a purchase from New Balance, and/or request to sign up for email, direct mail or SMS Text notices, we collect Personal Information that you elect to provide to us. Your submission of this Personal Information is entirely voluntary; however, if you elect not to provide this Personal Information, some of the services and/or features available on and/or through the Service may not be available for your use.
We also collect Personal Information when you register for "My Account", participate in a contest, event or sweepstakes promotion, fill out a survey or contact us (for example via email or by selecting "Ask the Expert" from the Service). We may also obtain data through your Internet browser, such as your IP Address, which is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet.
If you elect to register for "My Account", you will have the option to store your credit card information with our Service. This feature, which is entirely optional, is provided as a convenience for you so that you will not need to re-enter your full credit card information each time you make a purchase through the Service. If you elect to take advantage of this feature, please be aware that, as a security precaution, we will not store your CCV number. You will be required to input this information prior to placing an order. If you elect to store your credit card number in the "My Account" feature, you will have the ability to change your mind and remove your credit card number from storage at any time by logging into "My Account" and making the appropriate change.
If you elect to receive a copy of your 3D foot scan taken during your Stride I.D. experience, the measurement information associated with such images, as well as your contact information, described under the heading “New Balance Stride I.D. Experience information” will be stored securely in New Balance’s StrideID cloud, which is hosted on Amazon Web Services platform. We do not store or retain any 3D images or gait analysis photographs or videos of you.
Our licensed stores, which are independently owned, may also collect Personal Information which may or may not be shared with us. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the licensed stores other to the extent New Balance itself may use Personal Information of those licensed stores.
By using the Service or by providing us with Personal Information, you are consenting to this Privacy Policy and to our use of your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Information to us through the Service, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Information may be stored and/or processed in the offices, servers and equipment of Company and Company’s authorised third parties located in the United States and other third countries and you acknowledge and agree that the laws and protections afforded to Personal Information in the United States and in the other third countries may be different from those in place in the country in which you reside.
Sensitive Information
New Balance generally does not collect any "Sensitive Information" such as information about your race, political opinion, memberships or political associates, religious beliefs, philosophical beliefs, memberships of professional or trade associates, trade unions, sexual preferences, criminal records, health records or genetic information. If we do, we will seek consent to collect it if required by law to do so.

The Personal Information we receive from you will only be used for the particular purpose of which you provided it, and will not be used by New Balance for any secondary purpose, unless you consent to that use or the disclosure is required or authorised by Australian Law or a court/tribunal order or if it is reasonably necessary for the enforcement activities or an enforcement body.

These tools can also prevent children from disclosing online their name, address and other Personal Information without parental permission.
Children’s use of Stride I.D. experience
