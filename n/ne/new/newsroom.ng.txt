Privacy
Last Updated on October 15, 2014
This Privacy Policy discloses the privacy practices for Newsroom Nigeria and neusroom.com (including any other applications collectively referred to as the “Newsroom Nigeria”), and to any services that display this notice.
The Newsroom Nigeria Services may contain links to other websites for your convenience and information. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those sites.
WHAT INFORMATION DO WE GATHER ABOUT YOU?
The information gathered when you interact with the Newsroom Nigeria falls into two categories: 1) Personal information, which includes personal information you supply when you subscribe, order, complete a survey, register for one of our sites, enter a contest or provide your email address and 2) Non-personal information collected through technology, which includes tracking information collected by us as well as third parties.
Personal Information That You Give Us
Registration Information
Registration for the Newsroom Nigeria may require that you supply certain personal information, including a unique email address and demographic information (ZIP code, age, sex, household income, job industry and job title) to register.
You may choose to log in, create an account or enhance your profile at Newsroom Nigeria through the Facebook Connect feature on Newsroom Nigeria. By doing this, you are asking Facebook to send us certain information from your Facebook profile, and you authorize us to collect, store, and use in accordance with this Privacy Policy any and all information available to us through the Facebook interface. After you have connected, Facebook also sends us additional information from your profile that allows us to display a Facebook module on the pages you view.
To disassociate your neusroom.com registration from third party accounts, including Facebook, please see our Social Media FAQ.
Billing and Credit Card Information
To enable payment and donations via the Newsroom Nigeria Services, we collect and store name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card information and other billing information. This information will only be shared with third parties who help to complete the purchase transaction. Examples of this include fulfilling orders and processing credit card payments.
User Generated Content and Public Activities (Including Comments, Reader Reviews and TimesPeople)
We offer you opportunities to engage in public activities on neusroom.com and other Newsroom Nigeria Services. “Public activities” are any actions you take on neusroom.com that are designed to be visible to other users, including comments, recommendations, reader reviews, ratings or any other items that you submit. Any information you disclose in your public activities, along with your screen name or ID, or any image or photo, becomes public and may be used by The Newsroom Nigeria for online and offline promotional or commercial uses in any and all media. If you choose to engage in public activities, you should be aware that any personal information you submit can be read, collected and used by other users of these areas.
We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in the course of your public activities and we have no responsibility to publish, take down, remove or edit any of your public activities or submissions. For more information, see the Comments FAQ and read the Forums, Discussions and User
Generated Content section of the Terms of Service.
If you have registered for a neusroom.com account, we will track and aggregate your public activities on neusroom.com. By choosing to participate in public activities, you are electing to share and display such public activities via neusroom.com. Also, public activities may be included in RSS feeds, APIs and made available to other websites via other formats. As a result, your public activities may appear on other websites, blogs, or feeds. Keep in mind that we are not responsible for any personal information you choose to make public via your public activities, and you agree that such sharing will be deemed to have been done by you, not Newsroom Nigeria.
When you share or recommend (with or without adding your own comments) any Newsroom Nigeria articles or content to your Facebook profile, that action is governed by the Facebook Privacy Policy. We do not record those comments.
Contests, Sweepstakes and Special Offers
The Newsroom Nigeria collects personal information from you when you participate in sweepstakes, contests or special offers. If this information is also being collected by a third party other than Newsroom Nigeria, we will notify you at the same time. If you do not want any personal information shared, you should not participate in the sweepstakes, contest or special offer.
Reader Surveys and Market Research
The Newsroom Nigeria may collect personal information from you in connection with voluntary surveys conducted via the Newsroom Nigeria website. Data may be collected through the Newsroom Nigeria, on the phone or through the mail. The information you provide may be shared, but only in the aggregate, with advertisers and partners unless we notify you otherwise at the time of collection.
Conferences and Live Events
