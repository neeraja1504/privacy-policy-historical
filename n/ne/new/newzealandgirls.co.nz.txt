NZGirls does not control these third-party websites and cannot represent that their policies and practices will be consistent with this Privacy Policy. For example, other web sites may collect or use personal information about you in a manner different from that described in this document.

Non-Personal Information
Non-personal information is data about usage and service operation that is not directly associated with a specific personal identity. NZGirls may collect and analyze non-personal information to evaluate how visitors use NZGirls’ web sites.

An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet. For example, when you request a page from one of our sites, our servers log your IP address to create aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns and for purposes of system administration.

Every time you request or download a file from the web site, NZGirls may store data about these events and your IP address in a log file. NZGirls may use this information to analyze trends, administer the web site, track users’ movements, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use or for other business purposes.
