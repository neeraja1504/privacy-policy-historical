We use certain types of cookies which are “Strictly Necessary” or “Functional” cookies.  Please note that if you elect not to receive cookies, certain features or functionality of the Services which depend on Strictly Necessary Cookies or Functional Cookies may not function properly.

Functional cookies are used exclusively for providing an electronic communication service at the request of the internet user.  The information is conserved beyond your browsing session on the internet website, and can be transmitted to partners, uniquely for means of supplying provisions necessary to the services. These can be, for example, cookies that save the preferences of the user such as language preference of the user, cookies that save a “user session”, or cookies that provide a “virtual shopping basket”.
