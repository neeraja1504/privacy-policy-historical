Privacy Policy â€“ Nextbit
Welcome, and thank you for your interest in Nextbit Systems Inc. ("Nextbit", "we," or "us") and our web site located at nextbit.com (the "Site"), as well as all related web sites, mobile applications (each an "App") and other services provided by us and on which a link to this Privacy Policy (this "Policy") is displayed (collectively, together with the Site and the Apps, our "Service").
This Policy describes the information that we gather from you on the Service, how we use and disclose such information, and the steps we take to protect such information. By using the Service, you consent to the privacy practices described in this Policy.
This Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the Nextbit Terms of Use. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Policy have the meaning given to them in the Nextbit Master Terms of Service.
The information we collect on the Service:
User-provided Information. When you use the Service, you may provide and we may collect what is generally called "personally identifiable" information, or "personal information," which is information that specifically identifies an individual. Examples of personal information include name, email address, mailing address, mobile phone number, and credit card or other billing information. Personal information also includes other information, such as date of birth, geographic area, or preferences, when any such information is linked to information that identifies a specific individual. You may provide us with personal information in various ways on the Service. For example, you provide us with personal information when you register for an account, use the Service, post User Content, interact with other users or devices through communication or messaging features, or send us customer service-related requests.
"Cookies" Information. When you use the Site, we may send one or more cookies - small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your device. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Site. Please review your web browser "Help" file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings. Please note that if you delete, or choose not to accept, cookies from the Service, you may not be able to utilize the features of the Service to their fullest potential.
"Automatically Collected" Information. When you use the Service, we may automatically record certain information from your device by using various types of technology, including "clear gifs" or "web beacons." This "automatically collected" information may include your IP address or other device address or ID, web browser and/or device type, the web pages or sites that you visit just before or just after you use the Service, the pages or other content you view or otherwise interact with on the Service, and the dates and times that you visit, access, or use the Service. We also may use these technologies to collect information regarding your interaction with email messages, such as whether you opened, clicked on, or forwarded a message. This information is gathered from all users.
Third Party Web Beacons. We may also implement third-party content or advertising on the Site that may use clear gifs or other forms of web beacons, which allow the third-party content provider to read and write cookies to your browser in connection with your viewing of the third party content on the Site. Information collected through web beacons is collected directly by these third parties, and Nextbit does not participate in that data transmission. Information collected by a third party in this manner is subject to that third party's own data collection, use, and disclosure policies.
Integrated Services. You may be given the option to access or register for the Service through the use of your user name and passwords for certain services provided by third parties (each, an "Integrated Service"), such as through the use of your social network credentials, or otherwise have the option to authorize an Integrated Service to provide personal information or other information to us. By authorizing us to connect with an Integrated Service, you authorize us to access and store your name, email address(es), date of birth, gender, current city, account numbers and any other information that the Integrated Service makes available to us, and to use and disclose it in accordance with this Policy. You should check your privacy settings on each Integrated Service to understand and change the information sent to us through each Integrated Service. Please review each Integrated Service's terms of use and privacy policies carefully before using their services and connecting to our Service.
Location Information. Nextbit may offer certain features as part of the Service in whole or in part based on your location, such as to locate the mobile device on which you have installed or downloaded an App. We may collect your location based on information provided by you or the mobile device, including, if available, GPS, IP address or cell tower information. Without limiting the foregoing, even if you have not expressly granted us access to location data, we may nonetheless have access to location information contained in the your usage data.
Information from Other Sources. We may obtain information, including personal information, from third parties and sources other than the Service, such as our partners, advertisers, and Integrated Services. If we combine or associate information from other sources with personal information that we collect through the Service, we will treat the combined information as personal information in accordance with this Policy.
Google Analytics. Google Analytics is a data analysis service provided by Google Inc. ("Google"). We use Google Analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our App on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you use the App, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and other application usage related data. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information you submit within the App.
Further, Google may utilize the data collected to track and examine the use of this App, to prepare reports on its activities and share them with other Google services. Google may also use the data collected to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network. Google's privacy policy and how Google uses data collected through the Service is available at: google.com/policies/privacy/ and google.com/policies/privacy/partners/, respectively. If you choose to opt out of sharing any gathered data with Google Analytics, you may do so by unselecting "Report Metrics" under the "Settings" section of the App.

When we disclose information. We may disclose information to third parties if you consent to us doing so, as well as in the following circumstances:
We work with third party service providers to provide website, application development, hosting, maintenance, and other services for us.

We use certain physical, managerial, and technical safeguards that are designed to improve the integrity and security of your personally identifiable information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or store on the Service, and you do so at your own risk. We also cannot guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.
If we learn of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. We may post a notice through the Service if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.

We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures on the Service. Additionally, we cannot control the actions of other users with whom you may choose to share your information. Further, even after information posted on the Service is removed, caching and archiving services may have saved that information, and other users or third parties may have copied or stored the information available on the Service.
