Commissioned Data Processors. We may use third party service providers, commissioned data processors, such as licensors/developers of our Services, Third Party Platform Providers, and analytics companies, to help us provide or improve the Services we offer you. We may share information about you with these commissioned data processors so that they may provide their services to us and you in order to allow a proper functioning of the Services. Some of these commissioned data processors are located outside the territories of the European Union (EU)/European Economic Area (EEA), which may not provide the same adequate protection for personal data as the EU. The commissioned data processors located outside of EU/EEA are the following: (i) Nexon Korea Corporation, having its principal place of business at 7 Pangyo-ro 256 beon-gil, Bundang-gu, Seongnam-si, Gyeonggi-do, Korea; (ii) Nexon America Inc., having its principal place of business at 222 N.

Some of the information about you (included in your profile and nicknames) may also be visible to other NEXON users through the use of the Site, Services or through other related websites. Other NEXON users may be able to view information about your uses and interactions, such as your game results, scores, and profile information.
Legal Purposes. We may provide information about you to third parties or commissioned data processors where we have a good faith belief that doing so is required by law or to cooperate with regulators or law enforcement authorities. We may also provide your information to third parties in order to protect the rights or property of a third party or NEXON, including for the purposes of enforcing our Terms.

If NEXON is involved in a major business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of its assets, we may transfer the information about you to the successor organization in such transition. If material changes to NEXON’s privacy practices will occur as a result of the business transition, we will amend the Privacy Policy and the Information you previously submitted will continue to be treated pursuant to the last version of the Privacy Policy you agreed to unless you continue to use the Services/Site, which usage shall constitute consent to the new practices. The amended Privacy Policy will be notified on the Site and we will also notify you per email.
Game Events. For some game related events, we may share information, including your profile and nicknames, with third parties and either NEXON or the third party will post relevant privacy information in the official rules and/or registration area for the game related events. Should that privacy information, conflict with this Privacy Policy, the privacy policy of that particular game event will govern.
7. Your Choices
You may at any time indicate that you wish us to stop processing the information about you (if such information is necessary for you to have an account, you will no longer be able to use the Services and may no longer be able to use other aspects of the Service).
You may also at any time ”opt out” of receiving materials described in this Privacy Policy from us and/or our commissioned data processors. The materials that we send you (e.g., e-mails) will indicate that such materials are from us and will always provide you with a method of “opting out” of receiving future materials of a similar nature. If you do not ”opt out” of receiving such materials, this will signify your continuing consent to NEXON using your information to continue to provide you with such materials and otherwise share the information about you with or transferring it to our commissioned data processors who provide products or services (or advertisements, marketing materials or other information) that we believe may be of interest to you.
If you decide that you would like to ”opt-out” of receiving such materials from NEXON, please edit your account information on our Site accordingly. If, at any time after you have provided us with such information, you decide that you would like to “opt-out” of NEXON providing it to its commissioned data processors, please contact our customer service department by using the ticket submission form on the Site (at: http://www.nexoneu.com). Keep in mind that, while NEXON encourages its commissioned data processors, to adhere to our policies regarding the privacy of our users and otherwise to handle the information about you in a responsible manner, we cannot and do not assume any responsibility for any actions or omissions of third parties, including the manner in which they use information received either from us or independently.
8. Security of Your Information
Although we do not represent that we follow any particular, independent code of best practices, we maintain reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect your information. For example, we protect some of your information by using a firewall and Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption.
While we take reasonable precautions against possible security threats, there is no such thing as ”perfect security” on the Internet, so we cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur. We strongly recommend that you take steps to maximize the security of your information, such as not sharing your login information and logging out of your account after you are done using our Service.
We store your information in the EU/EEA as well as in other territories, more specifically in the territories of the commissioned data processors mentioned in Section 6. You consent to such storage and to the transfer of information from one territory to another, even when these territories do not provide for the same adequate personal data protection than the EU/EEA.
We will take reasonable steps to require any third parties who you authorize us to share information about you with to comply with the terms of this Privacy Policy.
9. Changes to Our Privacy Policy
From time to time, we may make changes to this Privacy Policy. If we amend this Privacy Policy, we will notify you and other users by posting and/or e-mail to the address which you have provided while registering to the Services, a revised version of the Privacy Policy. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will take effect after a reasonable time span as set forth in the notice of such changes. We will provide the notice by posting on the Site. Your continued use of the Site or Service after such notice and an appropriate time span as set forth in the notice will be deemed acceptance of such changes. We recommend that you return to the Site periodically to ensure familiarity with the most current version of this Privacy Policy.
