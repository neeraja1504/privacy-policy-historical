One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize pages in a Trial Environment we provide, a cookie helps us to recall your specific information on subsequent visits.

5.1 Reviewing, Correcting and Removing Your Personal Information
The GDPR offers people a number of rights concerning their personal information. We adhere to all of these with respect to data deletion, data transparency, data portability and data modification. When we are legally obliged to retain certain personal information, this obligation trumps the user rights. For instance, a person cannot demand us to delete financial transactions, because this would imply a breach of our legal accounting standards. If you have any questions related to your rights concerning personal information and the way we handle it, feel free to send an email to info@nexusthemes.com
6.1 Third Party Data Processing Agreements (DPA)
We make extensive use of professional third party suppliers of services (processors) which are a core part of our operations. Services which fall in this category is cloud hosting, email services, WordPress, payment providing and the like. To ensure your personal information is being dealt with in a way befitting the GDPR we've researched the parties in question and have obtained the relevant DPA's (Data Processing Agreements).
