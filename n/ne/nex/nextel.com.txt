Sprint | Privacy at Sprint Nextel
Due to the sensitive nature of the topics currently being reported in the press related to the National Security Agency and their intelligence gathering programs, Sprint Nextel is not discussing these matters.
Sprint is committed to protecting the privacy of our customers. We only disclose customer information when necessary to comply with the law. We also have a variety of safeguards in place that protect against unauthorized access to our systems.
Please read our Privacy Policy carefully so that you understand how we collect, access, use, disclose, and secure your personal information. Due to customer service system differences, Customer Care contact information differs between customers served on Sprint systems and Nextel systems. The privacy policy of the company is the same no matter which system is used to provide your customer care. However, to obtain the correct instructions, you need to visit the version of the Privacy Policy containing the correct contact information.
