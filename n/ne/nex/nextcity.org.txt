Privacy Policy – Next City
This Privacy Statement is applicable only to www.nextcity.org (the “Site”) and does not apply to any personal information that we may collect through other means, such as through other sites or offline.
The Information We Gather About You & What We Do With It
Next City collects personal information that you voluntarily provide to us through the Site under the following circumstances:
If you request a subscription or purchase a product, we collect your name, email address and payment information. All credit card and billing address information used to purchase stories or subscriptions is gathered by and stored by Stripe.com. Next City never views your credit card information but may use your billing address information to deduce the regional demographics of our readership.
If you post a comment to our Site, we store your email address, username and any personal information provided in your comment.
If you opt in to our e-newsletter, we collect your email address and any other information you provide, to contact you with Next City’s content and events.
If you choose to log in to Nextcity.org through Facebook, Facebook sends us information from your Facebook profile. Do not log in to our Site through Facebook unless you agree that we may collect, store, and use any and all information made available to us through Facebook.
You may choose not to provide this personal information to us, but then we may not be able to provide you with services or products available on the Site.
Cookies Policy
To enhance your experience on our Site, many of our webpages use “cookies.” Cookies are small text files that we place in your computer’s browser to store your preferences. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your email address or other personal information unless you choose to provide this information to us by, for example, registering on Nextcity.org. Once you choose to provide a webpage with personal information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie. A cookie is like an identification card. It is unique to your computer and can only be read by the server that gave it to you.
Cookies save you time as they help us to remember who you are. We use cookies to understand site usage and to improve the content and offerings on our sites. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience on our web pages (e.g. to recognize you by name when you return to our site). We also may use cookies to offer you products and services. We also use cookies to obtain analytical information related to user pageviews on our website, but this data does not contain personally identifiable information.
If you want to control which cookies you accept, you can configure your browser to accept all cookies or to alert you every time a cookie is offered by a website’s server. Most browsers automatically accept cookies. You can set your browser option so that you will not receive cookies and you can also delete existing cookies from your browser. You may find that some parts of the site will not function properly if you have refused cookies.
You can configure your browser to accept all cookies or to alert you every time a cookie is offered by a website’s server. Please be aware that if you do not configure your browser you will accept cookies provided by this website.

Next City retains subscriber emails and names, which may be used for Next City’s marketing and communication purposes. Next City may occasionally send emails on behalf of carefully screened companies whose products or services may be of interest to our readers. If you would like to be removed from this list, please write to info@nextcity.org with the subject heading “Marketing List Removal.”
In rare instances, we may disclose information about you to a third party if we are required to do so by law or feel that such action is necessary to prevent the misuse of our website, or the personal or public safety of our users or the public.
How We Protect Information
