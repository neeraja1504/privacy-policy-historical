When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
8. Access

Your ability to access and correct your information may be temporarily limited where access and correction could: inhibit Netenberg's ability to comply with a legal obligation; inhibit Netenberg's ability to investigate, make or defend legal claims; result in disclosure of personal information about a third party; or result in breach of a contract or disclosure of trade secrets or other proprietary business information belonging to Netenberg or a third party.
