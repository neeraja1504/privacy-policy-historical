However, you may choose to give us personal information in a variety of situations. For example, you may want to give us information such as your name and address or e-mail ID so we may correspond with you, or provide you with subscription or service opportunities. If you tell us that you do not want us to use information you provide to make further contact with you beyond fulfilling your requests, we will respect your wishes. If you give us personal information about somebody else, we will assume that you have their prior permission to do so.

Cookies, Web Beacons and Other Web Technologies :
WeÂ sometimes collect non-identifiable information from visits to the NetValuator.com site to help us provide better customer service. For example, we keep track of the domains from which people visit and we measure visitor activity on NetValuator.com, but we do so in ways that keep our visitor's identities anonymous. We may use this data to analyze trends and statistics and to help us provide better user service.
We collect the information we mentioned in the previous paragraphs through the use of various technologies, including one called "cookies". A cookie is a piece of data that a Web site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your computer as an anonymous tag that identifies your computer but not you. Some iSearch pages use cookies, sent by Intelius or its third party vendors, or other technologies to better serve you when you return to the Web site. You can set your browser to notify you before you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. You also can set your browser to turn off cookies. If you do so, however, some Web sites may not work properly.
Certain companies help us deliver interactive on-line advertising. These companies may collect and use information about customers to help us better understand the offers, promotions, and types of advertising that are most appealing to our customers. After the information is collected, it is aggregated so it is not identifiable to a specific individual.
Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to your website.

Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the advertising opt-out page. (Alternatively, you can direct users to opt out of a third-party vendor's use of cookies by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page.) We use Google Adsense and DoubleClick to display Ads on our website. Google may display Interest-based advertisements on your computer which will allow advertisers to show ads based on a user's previous interactions with them, such as visits to advertiser website and also to reach users based on their interests (e.g. "sports enthusiast"). To develop interest categories, Google Adsense will recognize the types of web pages users visit throughout the Google content network. As an example, if they visit a number of sports pages, Google Adsense will add them to the "sports enthusiast" interest category.
Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our website. Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to our users based on their visit to our site. Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy.
