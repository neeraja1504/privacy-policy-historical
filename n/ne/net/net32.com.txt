Net32 Privacy & Security Information
Privacy and Security
Net32 is committed to protecting the privacy of each and every user. We use the information we collect from you to process orders and to offer you a customized and valuable user experience.
Net32 will never sell, trade, rent, disclose or make available to any third party the information you provide while using this site.
Please review our frequently asked questions on privacy and security policies below. If you require more information on these or other topics regarding Net32's Web site, please contact us.
What information does Net32 gather? How is the information used?
When you order supplies, we need your name, e-mail address, shipping and billing addresses, and credit card number and expiration date. This allows us to process and fulfill your order and notify you of your order status.
We ask for the dentist's state license number because Net32 is a site for use only by licensed dental professionals.
Net32 asks for the dentist's DEA number only if an order is placed for an item requiring its provision (such as anesthetics). As an added protection, the number is masked, meaning asterisks appear in the field as the number is entered, just as with passwords.
Net32 gathers traffic patterns and site usage information to improve the design and layout of the site and personalize your shopping experience. None of this information can be used to determine the identity of any user.
How does Net32 protect user information?
Currently Net32 uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) software to protect your data and secure your transactions. SSL encrypts all your personal information, including your credit card number, name and address as it is transmitted over the Internet. This encryption makes business transactions over the Internet even more secure than purchasing by telephone.
SSL is a security standard supported by Microsoft Internet Explorer (3.0 and higher) and Netscape Navigator (2.0 and higher).
Net32 also uses secure Web pages to take orders and display sensitive information. None of your information can be accessed or released without your consent, and all information is stored in a secure database behind a firewall. Your account is accessible only with your user name and password.
Furthermore, under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your credit card provider cannot hold you liable for more than $50 of fraudulent charges.
If you prefer, you can always send us your credit card information by fax, telephone, or U.S. mail. For more information, contact Net32 customer service.
What about "cookies"?
A "cookie" is a small data text file that is stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Cookies themselves do not contain any personal information, and Net32 does not use cookies to collect personal information. Rather, we use cookies to log you onto the site.
How can users decline to receive e-mail?
Net32 may e-mail you information about weekly specials as well as newsletters featuring various products and services. If you don't want to receive this information, you can opt out at any time. Simply visit the "About You" section of the site and uncheck the box next to the statement, "Please e-mail me weekly specials". If you prefer, you may unsubscribe by following the procedure described in each e-mail.
