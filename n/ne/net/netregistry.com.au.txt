Privacy Policy | Netregistry
Netregistry respects the Guidelines suggested by the Australian Direct Marketing Association, in its Code of Practice for Consumer Protection in e-commerce.
We also abide by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Platform for Privacy Preferences Project (P3P). This policy is emerging as an industry standard providing a simple, automated way for users to gain more control over the use of personal information on web sites they visit.
In line with those guidelines, Netregistry would like you to be aware of the information we collect to provide your service. We do not provide third parties with access to your personal data, with the obvious exception of third party business partners such as domain name registries.
WHOIS domain information
When a domain name is registered, certain information is collected for use on the WHOIS service. The WHOIS service allows internet users to query a domain name to find out the identity and contact details of the registrant. The public WHOIS service is a standard feature of domain name systems around the world. Please see auDA's WHOIS policy at http://www.auda.org.au/whois-policy which sets out auDA's guidelines on the collection, disclosure and use of WHOIS data.
Call recording
Please be advised that both inbound and outbound phone calls may be recorded or monitored for quality assurance and training purposes. If you do not want your call to be recorded, please advise your customer service representative at the start of the call.
