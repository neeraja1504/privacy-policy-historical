NetEnt Privacy Policy (EU) | NetEnt | Better Gaming
INTRODUCTION
** ** NetEnt respects the privacy of everyone who uses our website netent.com including its subpages  (“Website”)  and/or plays our casino games  (“Games”)  which can be played via customers of ours  (“Operators”).
In this document we call the NetEnt group of companies “ NetEnt Group ”, and each NetEnt legal entity “ NetEnt ” or “ us ”/“ we ” and we call you (a visitor/user of our site or a player of our Games) “ you ”.
This document explains how we collect, process and store personal data belonging to you. “ Personal Data ” means information about you which can be used, on its own or together with other information, to identify you as a person.
ROLES
A  “Controller” decides why and how Personal Data is processed. The Controller can ask another company to process the Personal Data on its behalf and as instructed by the Controller. That company then becomes a “ Processor ”.
This document only applies where a company in the NetEnt Group is Controller. The Operator is Controller for Personal Data collected through the Operator and in the Games when you play them via an Operator (ex. data you provide when you register as a player, transaction data etc.). In those cases, the Operator’s privacy policy applies.
