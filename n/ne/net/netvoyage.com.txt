Privacy Obligations Regarding Customer Data Files within the NetDocuments DMS.
All data files which a customer uploads into the NetDocuments Service or creates within the Service remain the property of the customer.  NetDocuments is only a custodian for the customer data files.  All customer data files are encrypted in transit and at rest and are safely stored in highly secure data centers.  The customer controls all access to and use of the customer data files.  NetDocuments personnel have no access to customer data files except when explicitly granted by the customer.  NetDocuments has no knowledge regarding the content of customer data files.  This means customers assume responsibility for meeting Privacy Shield obligations and any other obligations or restrictions for how customer data files are used.  NetDocuments' responsibility is to provide a robust, highly secure DMS for its customers.
Within the DMS, your Documents are protected with industry-leading security. If you are a registered user of the NetDocuments Service our security system ensures that no one can access your documents except those with whom you choose to share them, which may include other employees or associates of your company, and your DMS Administrators. The NetDocuments Service has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information provided to the Service. The DMS servers are maintained in secure, safe, trusted and audited environments. Credit card information for the subscribing organization is collected using SSL encrypted pages and is only required when services are purchased. Credit card information is not stored online.
If you have questions or concerns about how customer data files may be stored by NetDocuments, you may contact our Compliance Department by sending an email to compliance@netdocuments.com or by telephoning 866-NET-DOCS (866-638-3627).
