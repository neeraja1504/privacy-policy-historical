How do we keep your Personal Information safe and secure?
We Are Committed To Keeping Your Personal Information Secure
The security of your Personal Information is important to us. As discussed below, we utilize physical, electronic and procedural security measures to protect against loss, misuse, and alteration of Personal Information under our control. We offer industry–standard practices and security measures to safeguard and secure the Personal Information we collect. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
We use a combination of firewall barriers, encryption techniques and authentication procedures, among others, to maintain the security of your online in-app session and to protect Network accounts and systems from unauthorized access.
When you register for the Service, Network requires a login id and password from you for your privacy and security. Network transmits Personal Information such as your Registration Information (as defined below) or Account Credentials (as defined below) securely.
Our servers are in a secure facility. Access requires multiple levels of authentication. Security personnel monitor the system 7 days a week, 24 hours a day.
We employ controls to limit access to our databases to those employees or service providers with a business need to access them. We encrypt your account password so that your password cannot be recovered, even by us. All backup drives and tapes also are encrypted.
We Enforce Physical Access Controls to Our Facilities
No employee may put any Personal Information or account Personal Information on any insecure machine (i.e., nothing can be taken from the database and put on an insecure laptop). In addition, Network frequently tests the Service for any failure points that would allow hacking.
However, it is important to understand that these precautions apply only to our Service and systems. We exercise no control over how your Personal Information is stored, maintained or displayed by third parties or on third-party sites.
Restrictions and Monitoring of Our Partners
Any partners we work with have been selected in accordance with our security policies and practices and are bound by confidentiality obligations. They may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.
We may also use third party vendors or service providers to help us provide the Service to you, such as sending e-mail messages on our behalf or hosting and operating a particular feature or functionality of the Service. We require such third parties to maintain the confidentiality of the Personal Information we provide to them.
Our Service Ensures Secure Communications with Encryption
From the time you submit your Login ID and Password so that communications between your device and Network are encrypted. This enables client and server applications to communicate in a way that is designed to prevent eavesdropping, tampering and message forgery.
You are responsible for keeping your Login ID, Password, Mobile Device, and Email Account safe and confidential.
We maintain strict rules to help prevent others from guessing your password. We also recommend that you change your password periodically. Your password must be 8-16 characters in length. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Login ID and Password. You may not provide these credentials to any third party. If you believe that they have been stolen or been made known to others, you must contact us immediately to our team, but in any event you should change your password immediately via the Network website.
You also agree that you control and limit access to the email account and mobile device. If your email address or your mobile device changes, you are responsible for informing us of that change.
We are not responsible if someone else accesses your account through Registration Information they have obtained from you or through a violation by you of this Privacy Policy or the Terms of Use.
You Can Delete Your Data Anytime by Discontinuing Use of Our Service
When you request us to delete your account for the Service, except as mentioned below, your Personal Information will be permanently expunged from our primary production servers and further access to your account will not be possible. We will also promptly disconnect any connection we had established to your Account Information (see below) and delete all account credentials.
However, portions of your Personal Information, in anonymous and aggregate forms, may remain on our production servers indefinitely. We reserve the right to use this aggregate data to improve our service and for other lawful purposes. Your data may also remain on a backup server or media but will be removed within a commercially reasonable period of time. Network keeps these backups to ensure our continued ability to provide the Service to you in the event of malfunction or damage to our primary production servers.
Also, please note that we also may need to store your data as required by federal, state or local law or by our regulators or to defend ourselves in any law suit brought by yourself or any third party.
