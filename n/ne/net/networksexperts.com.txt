The Outsourcing Center Portal is maintained by the Infoserver/Outsourcing Center, 12700 Preston Road, #190, Dallas, Texas 75230. The Chief Operations Officer can be reached by email at mjanssen@outsourcingcenter.
Outsourcing Center collects no personally identifying information about individuals except when specifically and knowingly provided by such individuals. In addition, Outsourcing Center may place a 'cookie' in the browser files of a user's computer. The cookie itself does not contain any personally identifying information although it will enable Outsourcing Center to track the pages a user reads.
All E-mail mailing lists maintained by Outsourcing Center contain the names of people who requested to receive information from us. Outsourcing Center may use such information for marketing and promotional purposes, may share the information for marketing and promotional purposes, and may share the information with companies that it has pre-screened.
A user's personally identifying information will be transferred to other parties that are providing the requested information, for example: research papers, specific story information requests, or 'ask the outsourcing experts' posting... While Outsourcing Center will seek to require third parties with which it has agreements to follow appropriate privacy policies, we do not bear any responsibility for any actions or policies of such third parties.
Outsourcing Center users should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose personal information (e.g., user name, e-mail address) on the Outsourcing Experts, an open forum, the Outsourcing Center will not remove them and that the information can be collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or parties.
Outsourcing Center reserves the right to change this policy at any time.
