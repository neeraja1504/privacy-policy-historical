COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES
We use cookies and web beacons (e.g., pixel tags) in order to gather information about how each user uses the Site, such as the time spent on a page, the frequency of the visits, or the click through. As stated above, we may collect your IP address, browser type, and domain name. Pixel tags cannot be removed because they reside in the code of the Site, rather than on the user’s computer. Additional information is below:
Cookies.Cookies allow a web server to transfer data to a computer for recordkeeping and other purposes. We and our third party service providers may use “cookies” on our Site and Services to, among other things, better serve you with tailored information and facilitate your ongoing access to and use of the Sites and Services. For example, we may use cookies for efficient management of the servers providing our Sites including when you access the Services. In addition, we may use cookies to determine whether you are accessing the Sites or features of the Services from our Services or another Internet service provider. ****
There are two types of cookies: session-based and persistent cookies. In addition, we also allow third parties to use cookies on our Sites, such as for analytical purposes.
*  **Session Cookies.** Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser or turn off your computer. We use session cookies to allow our systems to uniquely identify you during a session or while you are logged in to the Sites. This allows us to process your online transactions and requests and verify your identity, after you have logged in, as you move through our Sites.
*  **Persistent Cookies.** Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or turned off your computer. We use persistent cookies to track aggregate and statistical information about user activity, which may be combined with other user information.
*  **Third Party Cookies.** We may also engage third parties to track and analyze non-personally and personally identifiable website data. To do so, we may permit third parties to apply cookies to users of our Site, where permitted by law. We use the data collected by such third parties to help us administer and improve the quality of the Site and to analyze site usage. Such third parties may combine the information that we provide about you with other information that they have collected. These third parties are required to use your information in accordance with this Policy.
Disabling Cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Visitors to our Site who disable their web browsers’ ability to accept cookies will be able to browse the Site.
Web Beacons, Pixel Tags and Other Technologies. We use web beacons, such as clear GIFs, web bugs or pixel tags, which are tiny graphics with a unique identifier similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs in connection with our Site to, among other things, track the activities of Site visitors, help us manage content, and compile statistics about website usage. We and our third party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML e-mails to our customers, to help us track the success of our marketing campaigns. Like many websites, the Site’s servers generate log files. These logs record aggregate information about site usage such as Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser types, Internet service providers, referring/exit pages, pages accessed, platform types, date/time stamps, times of use, and page views, for example. This information is necessary to analyze trends, administer the Site, balance web traffic, evaluate users’ electronic browsing in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.
Site Analytics. Netbase works with third party service providers who use the technologies described in this section to conduct website analytics to help us track and understand how visitors use our Sites. For example, we use a variety of third party web analytics, to help us improve our Sites’ performance and user experiences.
RETENTION
We keep the personal information that we collect only as long as it is required for the purpose for which it was collected. In addition, applicable laws or regulations, or specific requests from government authorities may require us to preserve and retain information for a longer period.
USER GENERATED CONTENT
You may submit your own comments on certain portions of our Site, such as responding to a blog entry. Any information that you submit on our blog at Netbase.com will be viewable by all other visitors to this Site. Netbase is not responsible for the privacy of any information that you choose to submit through its Site, Services, or any public forum, such as a blog, or for the accuracy of any information contained in those postings. Any information that you disclose becomes public information. We cannot prevent such information from being used in a manner that may violate this Policy, the law, or your personal privacy.
SECURITY AND CONFIDENTIALITY
We take reasonable steps to maintain physical, procedural, and technical security in our premises, information systems, and information storage facilities in order to protect personal information in our custody from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, erroneous disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
