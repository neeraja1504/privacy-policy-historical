Updated Privacy Statement
This website (the " ** Site ") is operated by Netwheels.co.za (" ** Netwheels.co.za "). This Privacy Statement (the "Statement") describes Netwheels.co.za's collection, use and disclosure of information practices in connection with the Site. This Statement applies to the national version of the Site, located at www.Netwheels.co.za, as well as to any versions of the Site that Netwheels.co.za operates, including versions or pages that Netwheels.co.za co-brands or private labels with its newspaper and broadcast affiliates, third-party distribution partners and other partners (collectively, " ** Affiliates "). For example, you may have arrived at a co-branded version of the Site from an Affiliate's website, in which case, that Affiliate will be clearly identified at the top of the home page of this Site. In this Statement, Netwheels.co.za refers to those versions of the Site as " ** Affiliate Versions." Please be aware that Netwheels.co.za may share any information you submit through this Site with Affiliates, as described below. During your visit to any Affiliate Version, the Affiliate may independently collect other information from you.
For purposes of clarification, this Statement also describes Netwheels.co.za's collection, use, and disclosure practices with respect to any personally identifiable information and Usage Data (as defined below) that is provided to Netwheels.co.za by any of its third-party distribution partners that display Netwheels.co.za vehicle listings, such as Yahoo!.
This Statement does not describe Netwheels.co.za's collection, use and disclosure of information through means other than this Site (e.g., off-line) or the collection, use and disclosure practices of any Affiliate or other third parties. For information on a third party's information collection, use and disclosure practices, please review the privacy policy on the applicable third party's website. Also, please note that this Site contains links to other websites. Netwheels.co.za is not responsible for the websites, content or privacy practices of any third party. By using this Site, you acknowledge that you have read this Statement and agree that you are subject to the Netwheels.co.za Terms of Service.

You are not required to provide any personally identifiable information to visit the Site. Netwheels.co.za automatically collects Usage Data (as described below) and may collect ZIP codes and other information in connection with your use of the Site (e.g., the type of car you are looking for). Netwheels.co.za collects personally identifiable information only when you make it available through your use of the Site. You may be required to provide personally identifiable information to use certain services on this Site, including, but not limited to, the "Email the Dealer/Seller" feature and to purchase and create a "Sell It Yourself" online classified listing (" ** SIY Ad ") and account (" ** SIY Account ").
