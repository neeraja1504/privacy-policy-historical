NetLibrary - Privacy Policy
NetLibrary, a division of EBSCO Publishing, is committed to protecting end-user privacy online. We believe that electronic privacy is crucial for the ongoing success of the Internet. Except as provided in this policy, we will not disclose personally-identifiable information about an end-user to any third party without the end-user's consent.
I. Information We Collect
1. IP Address
The NetLibrary web site logs IP addresses for system administration purposes. Your IP address can help us diagnose problems with our server and track an end-user's session to give us an idea of which parts of our site end-users are visiting. In addition, we track system information, such as the type of browser you are using, your operating system, and the referring URL address.
2. Cookies
NetLibrary uses a feature of your browser called a cookie to store your member ID and state information about where you are in the site. NetLibrary uses cookies to keep track of where you are in the site since the Internet is a stateless environment, but many of NetLibrary's functions, such as moving from one page to the next in a book, require state. NetLibrary does not store any of your personal information in cookies. A cookie is simply a small data file that the web site writes to your hard drive. A cookie can't read any other data off your hard drive, pass on a virus, or read cookie files created by other sites.
You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. The NetLibrary web site will not operate properly without cookies enabled.
3. Registration
A significant amount of the site is available without registration, but in order to take advantage of some features of NetLibrary, you must register and create a member account. The NetLibrary online registration form requires you to provide your full name, email address, a User Name, and a password.
4. Use of E-Mail Addresses and other information
At your request, NetLibrary will use an e-mail address or other information that you supply to send a one-time e-mail inviting a friend to visit the site.
5. Links
This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that NetLibrary is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our end-users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this web site.
6. Usage and Circulation Records
As you interact with NetLibrary, your usage patterns are logged. This tells us if you searched to find information and what searches you used. We also log whether or not your searches were successful and what subject areas you visited. While you are viewing an eBook in NetLibrary, or while you have an eBook checked out, the system maintains a circulation record to know if you have access rights to that eBook. Unless you have violated the Terms of Use or the applicable eBook Agreement or we are required to do so by law; we only view, analyze, and disclose usage and circulation records in aggregated form.
II. Our Use of Your Information
The majority of the information we collect is analyzed anonymously so that we can improve your NetLibrary experience. One of NetLibrary's goals is to create an interactive learning system. To that end, we use our usage data to study how end-users seek information. Eventually, we hope to have enough data to help educators discover more about human learning and information analysis.
Any personally-identifiable information about you is used to improve your individual NetLibrary experience. This information is held in strictest confidence and is not shared outside of NetLibrary except as specifically described in this statement. If necessary, we will use your information to contact you.
1. Information Distribution
NetLibrary will never willfully disclose personally-identifiable information to a third party unless:
you have violated the Terms of Use or the applicable eBook Agreement
we are required to do so by law,
you give us your permission, or
the disclosure is permitted in this policy.
Except as provided in this policy, NetLibrary will only use personally-identifiable information within NetLibrary, and will only disclose other information in an aggregate form that cannot be linked to a specific individual. If a Library requests, NetLibrary may share a User's registration information (see I.3. above) and aggregated eBook usage and circulation records (see I.6. above) with the Library.
2. Opt-Out Features
You can review and change any of the personal information you provided by going to the Edit My Account button in the Navigation Bar.
Opt-Out Features
It is important to NetLibrary that you control how we use the information you provide.
To tell us you don't want to receive communication from NetLibrary, such as email newsletters announcing new features, contests, or new content, opt out at registration or send an email to privacy@NetLibrary.com
You can decline to provide personal information to us. Please note that in some cases this will limit your interaction with NetLibrary.
3. Security
NetLibrary uses industry-standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of all information, regardless of whether it identifies you or not.
Your password is a component of our security system. As such, it is your responsibility to protect it. Do not share your password with any third parties. If your password has been compromised for any reason, you should change it immediately.
4. Third Party Collectors of Information
NetLibrary's Privacy Statement only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. Any information you disclose to a third party, such as other end-users, is subject to that party's Privacy Statement. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.
5. General
This Privacy Statement is incorporated into and subject to the terms of the NetLibrary License Agreement, Library Agreement, and Terms of Use.
If you have any questions or concerns about privacy, please send email to privacy@NetLibrary.com.
6. Notification of Changes
If we decide to change our privacy policy we will give notice of the change so our end-users are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. This notice may be given by any means, including, without limitation, by posting the changes on our web site; or by notifying end-users via email or conventional mail; or by some other reasonable means. Users always have the ability to opt-out of receiving communications from NetLibrary by editing their account or sending an email to privacy@NetLibrary.com.
