In the process of serving advertisements, the ad serving companies may place a cookie in your browser's cookie file and may use information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements on this Site and other websites about goods and services that may be of interest to you. By delivering ads on our site, the ad-server is able to record what ads a user -- identified by the unique cookie -- has seen, and what pages the user was viewing when the ads were delivered. This web usage information is combined with other ad delivery information the ad-server has collected from your visits to our Site and other sites not affiliated with Net Detective. This non-personally identifiable information is used as part of the ad-serving process for reporting and to select and direct the ads you see online at our Site and other sites not affiliated with Net Detective.

If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you.

Exceptional Circumstances: If the HD Publishing Group or any of its lines of businesses or affiliated companies, is sold or disposed of as a going concern, whether by merger, sale of assets or otherwise, the relevant databases of Net Detective could, in whole or in part, be sold as part of that transaction.
