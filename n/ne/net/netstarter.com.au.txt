Privacy Policy
Introduction
Salmat Limited and its related bodies corporate (we, our, us) recognise the importance of protecting the
privacy and the rights of individuals in relation to their personal information this includes existing and
prospective customers of our clients, potential and existing employees and contractors whom Salmat collects
personal information from or is provided with such information from our clients . This document is our privacy
policy and it tells you how we collect and manage your personal information.
We respect your rights to privacy under the Australian Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and the New Zealand Privacy
Act 1993, as applicable (Act) and we comply with all of the Act’s requirements in respect of the collection, use,
management, disclosure, quality, security, access to and correction of your personal information.
( Includes Salmat Digital Pty Limited, Salmat Mediaforce Pty Limited, Local Direct Network Pty Limited, Lasoo
Pty Limited, and Netstarter Pty Limited)
What is your personal information?
When used in this privacy policy, the term “personal information” has the meaning given to it in the applicable
Act. In general terms, “personal information” means any information about an identifiable individual. This may
include an individual’s name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card details, account number,
and profession or occupation. If the information we collect personally identifies you, or you are reasonably
identifiable from it, the information will be considered personal information.
What personal information do we
collect and hold?
We may collect the following types of personal information:
●     name;
●     mailing or street address;
●     email address and telephone and facsimile number;
●     age or birth date;
●     system access passwords;
●     profession, occupation or job title;
●     where you are our employee, your personnel records including your employment agreement, pay
records, leave records, tax status, criminal record checks, superannuation records, training records,
and performance and disciplinary records;
●     where you are our customer, details of the products and services you have purchased from us or our
customers (on whose behalf we may provide products or services and may administer or host websites)
or which you have enquired about, together with any additional information necessary to deliver those
products and services and to respond to your enquiries;
●     credit card details;
●     details of your creditworthiness and credit history;
●     in the case of websites (for example, our Lasoo website), your account password, how you use the
website, and information regarding your browsing activity when you visit the website;
●     any additional information relating to you that you provide to us directly through our websites or
indirectly through use of our websites or online presence, through our representatives or otherwise;

Privacy Policy
●     information you provide to us through our service centre, customer surveys or visits by our
representatives from time to time.
It is important to appreciate that some of the personal information we collect and hold is done so by us when
we are acting as the service provider of our customer. We have set out in the Annexure to this policy some
more detail around the information we may collect and hold in respect of each of our key businesses. Please
read this carefully.
We may also collect some information that is not personal information because it does not identify you or
anyone else. For example, we may collect anonymous data or aggregated information about how users use our
websites. We do not re-identify this information to turn it into personal information.
How do we collect your personal
information?
Personal information is only collected by lawful and fair means in accordance with the Act. We collect your
personal information directly from you unless it is unreasonable or impracticable to do so. When collecting
personal information from you, we may collect in ways including:
●     through your access and use of our website, or websites hosted by us;
●     through your use of telephone and mobile communication (including but not limited to fixed line IVR
services, SMS and MMS);
●     through your use of electronic devices including tablets, supplied by us to you, or otherwise connecting
to our systems in order to facilitate and enable you to perform your duties or to provide services to us;
●     during conversations between you and our representatives;
●     during correspondence between you and our representatives, including electronic correspondence; or
●     when you complete an application, contract or purchase order.
Some of the personal information Salmat holds or deals with is not actually collected by Salmat. Because Salmat
is an outsourced service provider, much of the data and personnel information it deals with is provided to it by
its clients, and has not actually been directly collected by Salmat from the individual concerned.
It is impracticable for us to collect information directly from you when we are acting as the service provider of
our client, as our client has already collected the relevant information from you (or another third party), and our
client has provided it to us for our use in providing services to or on behalf of our client. For example, we act on
behalf of many customers in sending email communications. To enable us to do so we may use our customer’s
database of personal information which our customer has supplied to us. It is impracticable for us to “recollect”
this information from you directly before we use as requested by our client.
In respect of personal information which is provided to us by our clients, we do seek client assurances that all
such personal information has been collected lawfully and in compliance with the Privacy Act and that all
required consents have been obtained for, and disclosure statements made in respect of, the intended use of
that personal information. Salmat however will not be responsible for, and accepts no liability in respect of, any
failure by a client to do so.
We may also collect personal information from third parties who are not our clients including for example, from
third party companies such as data providers and brokers, credit reporting bodies, law enforcement agencies
and other government entities.

personal information?

Australian Privacy Act 1988 (Cth), these include exemptions in relation to (i) employee records; (ii) related
bodies corporate; (iii) provision of services to State or Territory authorities; and (iv) overseas operations
relating to personal information of non-Australians. Any permitted handling of personal information under
such exemptions will take priority over this Privacy Policy to the extent of any inconsistency.

(Cth) and the Unsolicited Electronic Messages Act 2007 (NZ). At any time you may opt-out of receiving

be $30 per hour of time spent. We will not charge for simply making the request and will not charge for making
any corrections to your personal information.
There may be instances where we cannot grant you access to the personal information we hold. For example,
we may need to refuse access if granting access would unreasonably interfere with the privacy of others or
would result in a breach of confidentiality. If that happens, we will give you written reasons for any refusal.
If you believe that personal information we hold about you is incorrect, incomplete or inaccurate, then you may
request us to correct it. We will consider if the information requires correction. If we do not agree that there
are grounds for correction then as required by the applicable Act we will, where requested by you, take
reasonable steps to attach to or associate with the information a statement of the correction sought but not
made, or a statement that the information is inaccurate, out-of-date, incomplete, irrelevant or misleading.
What is the process for complaining
about a breach of privacy?
If you believe that your privacy has been breached, please contact us using the contact information below and
provide details of the incident so that we can investigate it.
Our procedure for investigating and dealing with privacy breaches is to ascertain all relevant facts and
correspond with those involved (including where relevant our clients), reach a view as to the existence, scope
and cause of the issue, and where relevant and appropriate, implement corrective or rectification measures.
A request for access to the personal information held by Salmat concerning an individual can be made by that
individual to Salmat's Privacy Officer on the numbers or address mentioned below or, in cases where Salmat is
acting on behalf of a client, to Salmat's client. A fee may apply, the amount of which will be advised at the time of
application.
Do we disclose your personal
information to anyone overseas?
We may disclose personal information to our related bodies corporate and third party suppliers and service
providers located overseas for some of the purposes listed above. Some of our employees are located overseas.
Except where specific individual consent has been obtained, we take reasonable steps to ensure that the
overseas recipients of your personal information do not breach the privacy obligations relating to your
personal information.

●     our related bodies corporate located in Australia, New Zealand, Philippines, Hong Kong, and Sri Lanka;
