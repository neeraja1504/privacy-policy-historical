NetJets will also disclose personal information if required by law, including compliance with warrants, subpoenas or other legal process.
Does NetJets share my information with third parties?
We may contract with third parties to assist us in collecting, maintaining and managing our website visitor information, to fulfill subscriptions and other requests and/or to communicate with our website visitors. We do not authorize any of those third parties to make any other use of your information. NetJets requires third parties to which it discloses personal information to restrict their use of such information to the purposes for which it has been provided by NetJets and not to disclose that information to others. NetJets cannot be responsible, however, for any damages caused by the failure of unaffiliated third parties to honor their privacy obligations to NetJets.
Additionally, NetJets may share personal information with other companies, lawyers, credit bureaus, agents or government agencies in the following cases: (1) when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) the rights of NetJets or to anyone that could be harmed by such activities; (2) when we believe in good faith that the law requires it; (3) to our parent company or to any third party who may acquire NetJets; and (4) in situations involving threats to the physical safety of any person.
How do I access and update my information?
You can contact NetJets at 877-356-5823 or headquarters@netjets.com, to determine if we are keeping personal information about you. If we do have personal information about you, we will provide you with a readable copy of such personal information at no charge. Factual errors in your personal information, including information that is out of date, can be corrected by sending us a request that sufficiently details how your personal information should be corrected. We encourage you to promptly update your personal information if it changes.

What is a “cookie” and does NetJets place it on my computer?
When you access many websites, information may be stored on your computer in the form of a "cookie" or similar file that is saved in your computer's browser. NetJets does not store any personal information in cookies. All personal information is stored separately on its secured servers.
How does NetJets protect my personal information?
You can be assured that personal information collected through the websites is secure and is maintained in a manner consistent with current industry standards. The importance of security for all personal information associated with our subscribers is of utmost concern to us. Your personal information is protected in several ways. Your personal information resides on a secure server that only select NetJets staff and contractors have access to via password. We encrypt your personal information and thereby prevent unauthorized parties from viewing such information when it is transmitted to us. In order to most efficiently serve you, credit card transactions and order fulfillment are handled by established third-party banking, processing agents and distribution institutions. They receive the information needed to verify and authorize your credit card or other payment information and to process and ship your order. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, you acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations of the internet which are beyond our control; (b) the security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through the websites cannot be guaranteed; and (c) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party. If you do not want to provide your personal information to NetJets over the Internet, please contact NetJets at 877-356-5823 or in writing at: NetJets, 4111 Bridgeway Avenue, Columbus, Ohio 43219.
NetJets’ Commitment to Children’s Privacy
NetJets takes children's privacy seriously. We never collect or maintain information at our websites from persons we know to be under age 13, and no part of our websites are designed to attract anyone under age 13. Please do not communicate with or contact us if you are under age 13.
Changes to Policy
As we continue to develop our websites and take advantage of new technologies to improve the sites, this Policy will likely change. NetJets reserves the right to change, modify, or amend this Policy at any time without prior notice to you. We therefore encourage you to refer to this Policy on an ongoing basis so that you understand its current terms. Information on material changes to this Policy will be posted on NetJets' websites for thirty (30) days. NetJets may also let you know of the Policy change by communicating directly with you.
If you do not accept a changed version of this Policy (for example, if you do not approve of a different way that we intend to use personal information) you may let us know by letter or e-mail. If you do not send us any objections, we will assume that you consent to changes in the Policy. Changes will not apply retroactively to personal information that was collected before the changes to the Policy, except as may be required by law. If you have any questions about this Policy, you may contact us by mail at NetJets, 4111 Bridgeway Avenue, Columbus, Ohio 43219 or by e-mail at headquarters@netjets.com.

NetJets' websites may contain links to other sites that are not operated by NetJets. Please be aware that these sites may collect information about you. NetJets is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content on any websites that it does not operate. To ensure protection of your privacy, always review the privacy policies of those sites you visit.
