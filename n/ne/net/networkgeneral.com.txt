Children’s Privacy Protection
NetScout’s web Site does not target and is not intended for children under the age of 13. NetScout’s Site will not knowingly collect personal data from children, and will delete such data upon discovery.
European Safe Harbor Compliance
NetScout recognizes that the European Union (“EU”) has an “ominbus” data protection regime established pursuant to the European Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC) and that Switzerland has adopted a comparable data protection law (together, “European Data Privacy Laws”).  Among other provisions, the European Data Privacy Laws generally require “adequate protection” for the transfer to the United States of personal information about individuals located in Europe.  In the course of performing services on behalf of its European customers, NetScout may obtain incidental access to and otherwise process in the United States certain personal information about its customers’ consumers or other end users who are located in the EU and Switzerland (“European End User Data”).  NetScout adheres to the US/EU and US/Swiss Safe Harbor Privacy Principles published by the US Department of Commerce (“European Safe Harbor”) with respect to such European End User Data that it accesses or otherwise processes in the United States.  NetScout’s customers are the data controllers for any European End User Data.  NetScout acts as data processor for its customers, and follows its customers’ instructions for the processing of such European End User Data.  Any end users with questions about their data should first contact the relevant NetScout customer, as this may be the most efficient means of addressing such questions.  End users can also contact NetScout with questions at mbiso@netscout.com, 1-800-357-7666, 978-614-4000 or NetScout Systems, Inc., Attn: Information Security Office, 310 Littleton Road, Westford, MA, USA, 01866. Any European end user who cannot address his or her issue directly with the customer or NetScout can contact a local data protection authority.  For more information about Safe Harbor please refer to the US Department of Commerce website at http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/.
Enforcement of this Privacy Policy
NetScout uses a self-assessment approach to assure compliance with this Privacy Policy and periodically verifies that the policy is accurate, comprehensive for the information intended to be covered, prominently displayed, completely implemented and accessible and in conformity with the principles.  Interested persons may raise concerns using the contact information provided, and we will investigate and attempt to resolve any complaints and disputes regarding use and disclosure of personal information in accordance with these principles.  If a complaint or dispute cannot be resolved through our internal process, we agree to dispute resolution using an independent resource mechanism as a third party resolution provider.
Questions
If you have questions regarding our compliance with this Privacy Policy please contact us by making a written submission to NetScout’s Office of the General Counsel, 310 Littleton Road, Westford, MA, USA, 01866 or send an e-mail to infosecurity@netscout.com.
