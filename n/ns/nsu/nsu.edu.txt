Privacy Notice
Norfolk State University provides this Internet site as a public service. We do not obtain
personally identifying information about you when you visit this site unless you choose to
provide such information to us.
Any information collected within the context of your email inquiry or comment is used
only for the expressed purpose of responding to your inquiry or comment. We collect personally
identifiable information only if specifically and knowingly provided by you.
For site management, information is collected for statistical purposes. NSU’s computer
system uses software programs to create summary statistics, which are used for purposes such as
assessing what information is of most and least interest, determining technical design
specifications, and identifying system performance or problem areas. This information is not
expressed in any form that would reveal personally identifiable information.
NSU provides numerous online applications, forms and queries. When a user visits the
NSU website to perform a transaction (sending an application, initiating a query, receiving a
query response, etc), the web server receives data or sends a response and then may send a
cookie prior to breaking the connection with the user.
A cookie is a small piece of software that is placed by a web server on users’ personal
computers and is then used to personalize the site when a visitor returns. A transaction or
session, may involve a number of such information exchanges, each followed by a break in the
connection. In order to maintain the state (where one is in the process) of a transaction, the NSU
websites may place session cookies in memory allocated to users’ browsers. Session cookies
permit the users to perform transactions as if they were connected to the NSU website
throughout the course of the transactions or sessions. Session cookies are erased from the users’
61.001: Internet Website Acceptable Use and Privacy Policy                                         1
systems when they close their browsers; other cookies have an expiration date, or can be cleared
from the users’ cache. We will not use cookies to: acquire information about you, relay your
name to third-party mailing lists, scrutinize your web usage for marketing purposes by third
parties, or penetrate your hard drive.
I.     Choice to provide information
There is no legal requirement for you to provide any information at our website.
However, some services of the website may not be fully functional without providing
requested information. Failure of your browser to accept cookies will not prevent
your use of our website, but may prevent certain features from working. If you wish
to not provide this optional information, a particular feature or service associated with
that part of the web page will not be available to you.
II.    Information we collect
When you access our website the routing or client information and the technical
information listed below, is automatically collected. No other information is
collected through our website except when you deliberately decide to send it to us
(for example, by clicking on a link to send us an email). All information collected by
the website consists of the following:
1. Routing or client information: the Internet domain and Internet address of the
computer you are using.
2. Essential technical information: identification of the page or service you are
requesting, type of browser and operating system you are using, and the date and
time of access.
3. Nonessential technical information: the Internet address of the website from
which you linked directly to our website, and the "cookie information" described
below in number 5.
4. Optional information: when you send us an e-mail- your name, e-mail address,
and the content of your e-mail; when you fill out online forms- all the data you
choose to fill in or confirm.
5. Cookies: Our website places a “cookie" on your computer, unless your browser is
set to reject cookies. The cookie enables our website to recognize that you have
visited our website before and does not contain any personal information.
III. How the collected information is used
Routing information is used to route the requested web page to your computer for
viewing. We send the requested web page and the routing information to our Internet
service provider or other entities involved in transmitting the requested page to you.
61.001: Internet Website Acceptable Use and Privacy Policy                                           2
We do not control the privacy practices of those entities. Essential and nonessential
technical information helps us respond to your request in an appropriate format and
helps us plan website improvements.
Optional information enables us to provide services or information tailored more
specifically to your needs or to forward your message or inquiry to another entity that
is better able to do so, and also it allows us to plan website improvements.
We may keep your information indefinitely, but we ordinarily delete the transaction
routing information from our computer within 30 days after the web page is
transmitted and do not try to obtain any information to link it to the individuals who
browse our website. However, on rare occasions when a "hacker" attempts to breach
computer security, logs of routing information are retained to permit a security
investigation and in such cases may be forwarded together with any other relevant
information in our possession to law enforcement agencies. We use this transaction
routing information primarily in a statistical summary type format to assess site
content and server performance. We may share this summary information with our
business partners when needed.
Optional information is retained in accordance with the records retention schedules at
the Library of Virginia.
Under the “Virginia Freedom of Information Act”, any records in our possession at
the time of a “Freedom of Information Request” might be subject to being inspected
by, or disclosed to, members of the public.                   However, all identifiable
confidential/personal information will be removed prior to releasing the routing
information.
