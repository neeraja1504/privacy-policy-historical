Information Collection and Use

We collect nonpublic personal information about you in a variety of ways, including:
Information we receive from you on applications or other forms to open a deposit or investment account or to obtain insurance or information necessary to evaluate a loan request.

Information about your transactional experience and account history with us, our affiliates, or others. This information helps us to identify and protect your account against unauthorized access as well as identify additional products and services that may benefit you.
Information from a consumer reporting agency, such as that which establishes your creditworthiness or verifies your employment. This information enables us to determine eligibility for a requested product.
When you visit our company web sites, we may collect transaction, site navigation, customer contact and optional survey information. We use this information to enhance and personalize our online services. Refer to the "Online Information Privacy and Security" section below for more information regarding online privacy.

Fair Credit Reporting Act Requirements
Under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), NSB is permitted by law to share certain credit information with our affiliates. The information which can be shared includes account history and customer experience. In addition, although we are permitted under the FCRA to share non-experience credit information (e.g., credit report information obtained from a credit bureau) with our affiliates, consumers must be informed of this information sharing and provided a reasonable opportunity to opt out of such sharing.
In situations where an affiliate of the company plans to share non-experience credit information with another affiliate, NSB will honor your request not to share this information. It is important to remember that a FCRA request to not share applies to certain information about your applications with us, such as your account number, and information about your credit report or similar information obtained from credit bureaus and other sources outside NSB.
Refer to "Respecting Your Preferences" section below for more information on how to opt out of affiliate sharing of credit information.

All outside companies hired to perform specific services on our behalf are prohibited by contract from disclosing or using the information in any manner other than to fulfill the products or services requested by our customers.

Online Information Privacy and Security
Whether you are an established NSB customer or casually shopping for financial services online we want to assure you that you are in a safe, secure and confidential environment. Safeguarding the privacy and confidentiality of your information is of the utmost importance whether you interact with us over the Internet, at a branch, through an electronic terminal, or by telephone. Due to the technological nature of the Internet, however, there is additional information you should know when you access our products and services online.
[Top]
User identification and password
NSB requires you to select a user ID and password, which you can change at your convenience, to serve as your secure identification when using our online account information services. Together, these two pieces of information provide you online protection and enable you to view your account information quickly, easily and safely.
Your user ID and password should be kept secret. If you must maintain a written record of this information, you are strongly advised to store such record away from your computer or any other place it could be easily accessed. Never allow anyone to observe you inputting your user ID and password and always log off of our web site when you are away from your computer. If you feel either your user ID or password may have been lost or compromised, please notify us immediately at 1-888-835-0551.
[Top]
Secure server
For your protection, NSB utilizes Internet servers that require you to use a forms-capable browser such as Netscape’s Navigator, Microsoft’s Internet Explorer and America Online. When your browser communicates with our server, the application information is encrypted for security while traveling over the Internet. What this means is that while your information is traveling over the Internet it is scrambled until it reaches our server where it is unscrambled. This process is applicable to information flows to and from NSB’s servers.
[Top]
Account numbers
To further protect your information, NSB takes steps to prevent disclosure of account numbers when sending information about accounts to you by email.
[Top]
Cookies
In an ongoing effort to provide better service we utilize a technology commonly referred to as "cookies" when we interact with the browser on your computer. A cookie is a text file placed on your hard drive by our server and functions as a unique identifier and can be used for anonymously tracking individual data.
What is most important for you to know is that cookies do not collect personally identifiable information, and we do not align information collected through cookies with other personally identifiable information to reveal your identity. Cookies can be deleted from your browser and you can set your browser so that it will not accept cookies.
[Top]
Email
If you send us email, the content of your message, your email address and any limited, or one time response that we may provide, is archived in accordance with legal and government regulatory record retention requirements. If we collect your email address in this manner, we will not use it to notify you about NSB’s products and services unless you have granted us permission.
[Top]
Online surveys
Any information you voluntarily provide on surveys through our company web sites will be used for internal marketing purposes only. On occasion we may inform you of new products and services based on the information you provide.
[Top]
Online information collection and use
Our company web sites require certain types of information, such as your email address or your account number. These information requirements are necessary to enable you to perform certain tasks like reviewing your account information. However, if you visit our web sites and anonymously browse, no personally identifiable information will be collected. On an aggregate basis, we periodically gather usage data such as number of hits, pages visited and length of user sessions in order to evaluate the effectiveness of our web site designs.

Children under age 13
NSB may offer financial products and services designed to educate children in the fundamental aspects of financial management.
