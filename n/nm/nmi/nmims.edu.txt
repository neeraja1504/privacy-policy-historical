This document will help you understand the terms and conditions under which personal information is provided to this website. Please note that this policy is effective only within NMIMS’s domain, and does not apply to websites that may be accessible from external links provided in various pages of this website. Also note that due to the very nature of internet technology and evolving threats, this policy may be updated from time to time. All such updates will be posted in the privacy policy page. In continuing to use this website, you indicate your acceptance of the terms and policies.

These sections include, but are not limited to news feed requests, brochure or video requests, Donations, Registrations, Books, Journals and Alumni Profiles, subscription to mailing lists, alumni profile updates, applications and certain databases. As a general rule, NMIMS will not sell, swap, rent, or otherwise disclose to any third party any such personal information for commercial purposes.

System Information Including IP Addresses
When you connect to our website, our web server may record the numerical Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer you are using, information about your browser and operating system, date and time of access and the internet address and page which linked you to our site. The Institute’s staff uses such information to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer and improve our website and to generate aggregate statistical reports that analyze general user information and demographics. Such extrapolations and statistics may be made public; however, they cannot be tracked to individual users. Unless required by legal process, we do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that user sessions may be tracked by IP address, but a user's identity remains anonymous.
In addition, we ordinarily do not disclose to third parties site usage by individual IP addresses, but may do so in very limited circumstances when complying with law or legal process, working with consultants assisting us in fixing or improving our site, or in monitoring and improving the security of our network. Our staff monitors search terms that users enter into our Search Engine, but this tracking is never associated with individual users.
