NYC Airporter Privacy Policy - We are Committed to Protecting Your Privacy
You can always visit our site without revealing who you are or providing any Personal Information. When you visit our site or visit our site through one of our partner’s sites, we do collect usage information (“session data”), but it is anonymous and is not linked to you as an individual. We use session data to better understand things like how our site is navigated, how many visitors arrive at specific pages, the length and frequency of stays at our site, the variety of searches of our site’s database, the types of browsers and computer operating systems used by our visitors and the Internet Protocol addresses from which our visitors connect to our site. We use this information to improve our site content and ease of use.
Use of Internet Protocol (“IP”) Addresses
An IP address is a unique number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you’re surfing the Internet so that your computer can be identified by the main computers, known as “Web servers”, that “serve up” Web pages.
NYCAirporter.com and/or its affiliates collect IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregated information to our advertisers, and to audit the use of our site. When Users request pages from NYCAirporter.com and/or its affiliates’ sites, our servers log the Users’ IP addresses. We do not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a User’s session will be logged, but the User will remain anonymous to us. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a User when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our site terms of use or terms of service or to protect our service, site, Users or others.

E-mail notifications
We may use your e-mail address or telephone number to contact you about changes to your purchased travel itinerary. To make these e-mails more useful to you, we may attach a Web beacon that provides confirmation when you open an e-mail from NYCAirporter.com. This only occurs if your computer supports such technology.

We will use your e-mail address or telephone number to respond when you submit a question or suggestion, or request assistance with viewing your itinerary, logging on to NYCAirporter.com, or accessing your account.

Specifically, your information is secured from unauthorized access from the Internet through market leading firewall technology.

Depending on your browser, this SSL will have encryption keys of up to 64 bits.
