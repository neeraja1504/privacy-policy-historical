The way we use cookies
Cookies are small pieces of information that some websites ask to store on (and later retrieve from) your computer. When you visit New York Habitat's Website, cookies are stored into your browser, provided your browser accepts them. The information stored on those cookies contains a randomly generated string but no personal information. Those cookies will allow you to retrieve previously selected preferences (if any) each time you come back visiting our website. Additionally, we may use cookies and third parties applications from time to time to build statistics using information such as browser, URL, IP address.
The way we protect your privacy
We use the information you provide about yourself when placing a request only to complete that request. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete a transaction. We use return email addresses to answer the emails we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.
You can register with our website if you would like to receive specific information as well as general updates on company news and services. Information you submit on our website will not be used for this purpose unless you fill out the registration form.
We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.
Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described.
Our commitment to security
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
Our commitment to children privacy
Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information on our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13. If and when it is discovered that a registration form or any other information has been submitted by an individual under the age of 13, New York Habitat deletes it immediately.
