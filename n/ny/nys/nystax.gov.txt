Thank you for visiting the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance (hereinafter “DTF”) website.

DTF recognizes that it is important for individuals, businesses and tax professionals to be confident that their privacy is protected when they visit DTF’s website.
Consistent with the provisions of the Internet Security and Privacy Act, the Freedom of Information Law, the Personal Privacy Protection Law, and the Tax Law, this policy describes DTF's privacy practices regarding information collected from users of this website. This policy describes what information is collected and how that information is used. Because this privacy policy only applies to this website, you should examine the privacy policy of any website, including other state agency website, that you access using this website.
For purposes of this policy, “personal information” means any information concerning a natural person which, because of name, number, symbol, mark, or other identifier, can be used to identify that natural person. DTF does not collect any personal information about you during your visit to this website unless you provide that information voluntarily; for example, by sending such information in an email or by providing it in connection with an online transaction.
Information collected automatically when you visit this website
When visiting this website, DTF automatically collects and stores the following information about your visit:
The Internet Protocol (IP) address and domain name used, but not the email address. The Internet Protocol address is a numerical identifier assigned either to your Internet service provider or directly to your computer;
The type of browser and operating system used;
The date and time you visited this site;
The webpages or services you accessed at this site;
Any form, publication or document which you downloaded; and
Depending on how you access DTF’s site, DTF may also, on occasion, capture the website you visited prior to coming to DTF’s website.
None of the foregoing information is deemed to constitute personal information.
The information that is collected automatically is used to improve this website's content and to help DTF understand how users are interacting with the website. This information is collected for statistical analysis, to determine what information is of most and least interest to our users, and to improve the utility of the material available on the website. The information is not collected for commercial marketing purposes and DTF is not authorized to sell or otherwise disclose the information collected from the website for commercial marketing purposes.
Cookies
The use of cookies is a standard practice among Internet websites. The DTF website uses cookies. Cookies are small files stored on your computer by your Web browser to provide a means of distinguishing among users of the website. The cookies DTF utilizes do not contain personal information and do not compromise your privacy or security.
The software and hardware you use to access the website allows you to refuse new cookies or delete existing cookies. Refusing or deleting cookies may limit your ability to take advantage of some features of this website.
Information collected when you send DTF an email or conduct an online transaction through this website
During your visit to this website, you may send an email to DTF. Your email address and the contents of your message will be collected. Your email address and the information included in your message may be used to respond to you, to address issues you identify, to improve this website, to forward your message to another State agency for appropriate action, and/or to communicate with you regarding general tax information and DTF services. Your email address is not collected for commercial purposes and DTF is not authorized to sell or otherwise disclose your email address for commercial purposes.
During your visit to this website you may conduct an online transaction. This includes, for example, filling out an online survey or order form or utilizing any of DTF’s online services. The information, including personal information, provided by you in conducting the transaction is used by DTF to operate DTF programs, which include the provision of services and information. The information collected by DTF may, to the extent permitted by law, be disclosed by DTF for those purposes that may be reasonably ascertained from the nature and terms of the transaction in connection with which the information was submitted.
DTF does not knowingly collect personal information from children or create profiles of children through this website. Users are cautioned, however, that the collection of personal information submitted in an email will be treated as though it was submitted by an adult, and may, unless exempted from access by federal or State law, be subject to public access. DTF strongly encourages parents and teachers to be involved in children’s Internet activities and to provide guidance whenever children are asked to provide personal information online.
Information and choice
As noted above, DTF does not collect any personal information about you during your visit to this website unless you provide that information voluntarily by sending an email or conducting an online transaction. This includes, for example, filling out an online survey or order form or utilizing any of DTF’s online services. As a general matter, you may choose not to send an email, not to fill out a survey or online order form and/or not to utilize DTF’s online services (some transactions may, however, be required by law to be conducted online, such as mandatory e-filing, through DTF's online services). While your choice not to participate may limit your ability to receive specific services through this website, it will not usually prevent you from requesting services from DTF by other means (e.g., by telephone or United States mail or similar delivery service) and will not normally have an impact on your ability to take advantage of other features of the website, including browsing or downloading publicly available information.
Disclosure of information collected through this website
The collection of information through this website and the disclosure of that information are subject to the provisions of the Internet Security and Privacy Act.
