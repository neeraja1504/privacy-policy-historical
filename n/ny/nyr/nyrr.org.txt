15. Additional Disclosures for Data Subjects in Europe
A.   Data Controller.
Data protection laws in Europe make a distinction between organizations that process personal data for their own purposes (known as “controllers”) and organizations that process personal data on behalf of other organizations (known as “processors”).
NYRR generally acts as the controller of your information submitted to NYRR through our Services; however NYRR also in some instances will be engaged by a client for processing services.
B.  Lawful Basis for Processing.
Data protection laws in Europe require a “lawful basis” for processing personal data. Our lawful bases include where: (a) you have given your consent to our processing for a specific purpose, either to us or to our service providers, or partners; (b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with you or to comply with a legal obligation; or (c) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by NYRR and fundamental rights do not override these interests.
C.   Your Rights.
If you are a data subject in Europe, you have the right to access, rectify, or erase any personal data we have collected about you through the Services. You also have the right to data portability and the right to restrict or object to our processing of personal data we have collected about you through the Services. In addition, you have the right to ask us not to process your personal data (or provide it to third parties to process) for marketing purposes or purposes materially different than for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you. You may withdraw your consent at any time for any data processing we do based on consent you have provided to us.
You may exercise your rights by submitting a written request to us at the address set forth in the “Contact Us” section. We will respond to your request within 30 days. We may request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and process your request. Applicable law may require or permit us to decline your request. If we decline your request, we will tell you why, subject to legal restrictions.
D.   Complaints.
If you would like to submit a complaint about our use of your personal data or response to your requests regarding your personal data, you may contact our Data Protection Officer or submit a complaint to the data protection regulator in your jurisdiction. **** NYRR would however appreciate the opportunity to address your concerns before you approach a data protection regulator, and would welcome you directing an inquiry first to us at the address set forth in the “Contact Us” section.
