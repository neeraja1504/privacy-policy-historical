IMG Worldwide New York Fashion Week Privacy Policy
Effective Date: September 5, 2018
This Privacy Statement describes how information about you is collected, used, and disclosed by IMG Worldwide, LLC and our parents, subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, "IMG Worldwide," "we" or "us") when you attend New York Fashion Week ("NYFW") events, access or use our NYFW website or mobile application (collectively, the "Service"), or otherwise interact with us in connection with NYFW. Please note that we may have different privacy statements with respect to certain parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, programs, or activities, and in those cases, this Privacy Statement will not apply.
INFORMATION COLLECTION
Information You Provide to Us
IMG Worldwide collects information from you when you choose to provide it to us. This may include when you request information from us, sign up for our newsletters or email lists, access or use our Service, make a purchase, participate in our contests, promotions, sweepstakes, surveys, or interviews, request support, or otherwise interact with us.
The information we collect may include your name, address, email address, telephone number, photos, videos, payment information, and any other information you choose to provide. You may also be required to provide certain information to access certain portions of the Service.
Information We Automatically Collect
We may use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags, log files, or other technologies to automatically collect certain information when you use our Service. For example, we may automatically collect information such as your browser type, device type and operating system, unique device identifier, software version, IP address, and the domain name from which you accessed the Service. We also may collect information about your use of the Service including the date and time you access the Service, the areas or pages of the Service that you visit, the amount of time you spend using the Service, the number of times you return, whether you open, forward, or click-through emails and ads, log files, and other Service usage data. You may adjust your browser or operating system settings to limit this tracking or to decline cookies, but by doing so, you may not be able to use certain features on the Service or take full advantage of all of our offerings. Check the "Help" menu of your browser or operating system to learn how to adjust your tracking settings or cookie preferences. Note that our system may not recognize some or all Do Not Track headers from browsers.
If you choose to turn on your Bluetooth, wifi, or other geolocation functionality when you use the NYFW mobile application, the application will collect and use your geolocation information. You can subsequently stop the collection of this information at any time by changing the settings on your mobile device. If you do so, certain features of the application will no longer function. Certain features of the NYFW mobile application may also require access to your mobile device’s native calendar application. If you decide to use these features, we will ask for your consent before accessing your calendar. You can revoke this consent at any time by changing the settings on your device, if your device offers that option.
We may also collect information from you if you choose to use wearable devices we provide at events. For example, we may collect information about your heart rate, body temperature, location, motion and step count.
If you attend NYFW events where we are capturing audio and video recordings, we may also collect sound clips and images of you. We may also use cameras and sensors to collect environmental information at NYFW events, such as information about temperature changes, noise and humidity levels and amounts of motion.
Information We Collect from Other Sources
We may receive information about you from other sources and link or combine that with information we collect about you. For example, we may collect publicly available information about you from social media platforms. In addition, if you log into or access the NYFW mobile application using a third party social media platform, we will have access to certain information from that platform, such as your email address, friends list and public profile information.
