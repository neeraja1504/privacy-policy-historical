Notice of Information Practices
Your Privacy is our Concern
When you apply for any type of insurance, you disclose information about yourself to us. The collection, use and disclosure of such information is regulated by law. NJM Insurance Group maintains physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with state and federal regulations to guard your personal information. We also limit employee access to personally identifiable information to those with a business reason for knowing such information. NJM Insurance Group also instructs our employees so that they will understand the importance of the confidentiality of personal information, and takes appropriate measures to enforce employee privacy responsibilities.
What kind of information do we collect about you and from whom?
NJM Insurance Group obtains most of our information directly from you. The application you complete, as well as any additional information you provide, generally gives us most of the information we need to know. Sometimes we may contact you by phone or mail to obtain additional information. We may use information about you from your transactions with us, our affiliates or others.
Depending on the nature of your insurance transaction, we may need additional information about you or other individuals proposed for coverage. For auto insurance, we may need information from your motor vehicle records. For property coverages, we may send someone to inspect your property and verify information about its value and condition. A photo of any property to be insured might be taken. We may review insurance claims information and other loss information reports, and we may also obtain medical or financial information to adjust some claims.
We may obtain the additional information we need from third parties, such as other insurance companies, governmental agencies, information clearinghouses, courts and other public records. We may request information from a consumer reporting agency.
If we order an investigative consumer credit report, we will notify you as required by state laws and the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). Under the FCRA, you have the right to ask to be personally interviewed if we order an investigative consumer report. Upon request, we will tell you how to get a copy of the report. The agency that prepares a consumer report for us may retain that report and disclose it to other persons as permitted by law.
What do we do with the information collected about you?
Information that has been collected about you may be retained in our records. We review it in evaluating your request for insurance coverage and in determining your rates. We will also refer to and use information in our policy records for purposes related to issuing and servicing insurance policies and settling claims.
If coverage is declined or the charge for coverage is increased because of information contained in a consumer report we obtained, we will tell you as required by state law and the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act. We will also give you the name and address of the consumer reporting agency making the report.
We may retain information about our former customers and would disclose that information to affiliates and nonaffiliates as described in this notice.
To whom do we disclose information about you?
We do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about our customers or former customers, except as permitted by law. That may mean that we will make disclosures to the following types of third parties without your consent:
Our affiliated companies;
Parties who perform a business, professional or insurance function for our Company, including our reinsurance companies;
Independent claims adjusters, appraisers, investigators and attorneys who need the information to investigate, defend or settle a claim involving you;
Businesses that help us with data processing or marketing;
Businesses that conduct scientific research, including actuarial or underwriting studies;
Other insurance companies, agents or consumer reporting agencies as reasonably necessary in connection with any application, policy or claim involving you;
Insurance support organizations that are established to collect information for the purpose of detecting and preventing insurance crimes or fraudulent claims;
Medical care institutions or medical professionals to verify coverage or conduct an audit of services;
Insurance regulatory agencies in connection with the regulation of our business;
Law enforcement or other governmental authorities to protect our legal interests or in cases of suspected fraud or illegal activities;
Authorized persons as ordered by a subpoena, warrant or other court order or as required by law;
Certificate holders or policyholders for the purpose of providing information regarding the status of an insurance transaction; or
Lienholders, mortgagees, lessors or other persons shown on our records as having a legal or beneficial interest in your policy.
How can you find out about information we have about you?
You have the right to know what kind of information we keep in our files about you, to have reasonable access to it and to receive a copy. If you have questions about what information we may have on file, contact us as instructed at the end of this notice. Tell us what information you would like to receive. Provide your complete name, address, date of birth, type of policy held or applied for and all policy numbers issued to you by us. Certain types of information generally collected when evaluating claims or possible lawsuits need not be disclosed to you.
Within thirty (30) business days of receipt of your request, we will inform you in writing of the nature and substance of locatable, retrievable and available recorded personal information about you in our files. You may review this information in person or receive a copy at a reasonable charge. We will also identify the person or organizations to whom we have disclosed this information within the past two (2) years. In addition, you will be given the name and address of any consumer credit reporting agency that prepared a report about you so that you can contact them for a copy of that report if you wish.
After you have reviewed the personal information about you in our file, you can contact us if you believe it should be corrected, amended or deleted. Tell us what you think is wrong and why. We will consider your request and within thirty (30) business days, either change our files or tell you that we did not and the reason. If we do not make changes, you will have the right to insert in our file a concise statement containing what you believe to be the correct, relevant or fair information and explaining why you believe the information on file to be improper.
