We will send you strictly product/service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, to assist you with product usage or notification of product and service maintenance, we might send you an email.
Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you can contact us.
Customer Service
Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will send you a welcoming email to verify information you provided.

We provide you the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information. For example, if you purchase a product/service but do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, you can indicate your preference on our order form.

We will share or sell your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy statement. We do not sell your personal information to third parties except as described in this privacy policy (see "Business Transitions")
We may provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities such as shipping your order or offering customer service. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us. We will not disclose information about you to anyone else unless the disclosure:
- is required by law; or
- is authorized by law (for example to protect our interest or where we have a duty to the public to disclose that information); or
- has been consented to by you.
Business Transitions
In the event Nitro Software, Inc goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via email or prominent notice on our Web site for 30 day of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.
Access
You may request that we provide you with access to the personal information we hold about you at any time. We will respond to your request for access within 30 days. If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, delete/remove or deactivate it by making the change in your account or by emailing us or by contacting us by postal mail at the contact information listed below. Generally we will be able to provide you with such access. However, where:
the access impacts on the privacy of others;
the request for access is frivolous or vexatious;
there are existing or anticipated legal proceedings
such access can be denied under law or by law enforcement agency; or
where the information is evaluative.
We may not be able to provide you with access to such information. If we deny your request for access, we will let you know why. We may also charge a fee to cover our reasonable costs associated with your request.
Personal information security and data retention
We will take all reasonable precautions to protect your personal information from loss, misuse or alteration. This includes both physical and technological security measures. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services contact us. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
Website
We only collect personal information from our website if you submit details to us via email or forms on our website. The information collected is limited to your email address and the contents of any message you may send to us. Personal information collected from our website will only be used for the purpose for which you have provided it and it will not be added to a mailing list or used for any other purpose without your consent. Our website uses various types of cookies and other tracking technologies:
Per-session cookies: Used to assess and improve the performance of the web site for our users. These cookies are anonymous and in no way identify users.
Persistent cookies: Used to make areas of the site that require a person to be logged in easier to use. For example, managing Expert Support enquiries.
Third Party Cookies: The use of cookies by third parties such as our tracking utility company and service providers are not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these cookies.
As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.
Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)
We and our third party advertising partner employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information.
We partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other Web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking here: http://preferences.truste.com/. Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.
