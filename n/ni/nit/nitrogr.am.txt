Personal information collected on the Service may be stored and processed in France, the United Kingdom or any other country in which the company operates, and by using this site, you consent to any such transfer of information outside your country.

Backups are run to prevent loss of information, and we will continue to enhance security as new technology becomes available.
While we make every effort to ensure that your information is secure on our system, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. Here is where you come in: you can play an important role in keeping your personal information secure by maintaining the confidentiality of your password used on Instagram. We recommend that you change your password from time to time for additional security. Please contact Instagram immediately (support@instagram.com) if there is any unauthorised use of your account by any other Internet user or any other breach of security.
As mentioned previously, we have security measures in place to protect our customer database and access to this database is restricted internally. However, it remains each user’s responsibility:
