The security of your information is very important to us. We use the 128-bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to protect the security of your online order information. SSL technology encrypts your order information to protect it from being decoded by anyone other than us.
Once you enter the checkout page your computer will begin communicating with The BigCommerce server in secure mode. You can tell that you are in secure mode by the following:
The “http” in the web address will be replaced by “https”
Depending on the browser, you may see either a padlock (Microsoft Internet Explorer, AOL, Netscape Communicator) or a solid key (Netscape Navigator) in the lower section for the browser window.
Only browsers that use the 128-bit Secure Socket Layer technology are able to order through our site. If your browser does not support SSL, you can get an upgrade at Microsoft’s or Netscape’s home page.
While we implement the above security measures on this site, you should be aware that 100% security is not always possible.
