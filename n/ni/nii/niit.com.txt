In order to protect your privacy, NIIT has adopted the following principles:
​​ (a) Security
Wherever your Personal Information may be held within NIIT, the company intends to take reasonable steps to protect it from unauthorized access or  disclosure. NIIT is committed to protecting the security of your personal information.

For example, we store the personal information you provide on computer  systems with limited access, which are located in controlled facilities. When we transmit highly confidential information (such as a credit card number or  password) over the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
​​ (b) Choice
​​ You may choose whether or not to provide Personal Information to NIIT. The notice NIIT intends to provide at the point where it collects Personal  Information on the Site, should help you to make this choice. If you choose not to provide the Personal Information we request, you can still visit most of  NIIT's Web sites, but you may be unable to access certain options, offers, and services that involve our interaction with you. If you chose to have a  relationship with NIIT, such as a contractual or other business relationship, NIIT will continue to contact you in connection with that business relationship.
