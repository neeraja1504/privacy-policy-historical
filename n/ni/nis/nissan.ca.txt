1. Objective & Scope of Policy
Nissan is committed to respecting your privacy and has prepared this Privacy Policy to explain to you our policies and practices regarding Nissan’s collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information.
This Privacy Policy governs Personal Information collected from and about individuals who are or may become Nissan customers and individuals who visit a Nissan website or otherwise provide their Personal Information to Nissan.
Using contractual or other arrangements, Nissan shall ensure that agents, contractors or third party service providers, who may receive Personal Information in the course of providing services to Nissan as part of our delivery of products and services, are required to protect that Personal Information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to Nissan’s collection of aggregate, anonymous information (information which does not identify and cannot be used to determine the identity of any individual). Nissan may use aggregate, anonymous information for any purpose permitted by law.
For quality assurance purposes, we may monitor and record calls to our customer service department.
2. The Collection, Use & Disclosure of Personal Information

Nissan collects Personal Information from you in a number of different ways:

From vendors who provide lists of names and addresses, where you have provided your consent, to send marketing and promotional materials or other information about our products and services. The use of your Personal Information by these vendors is governed by their privacy policy.
Nissan does not knowingly collect Personal Information from anyone under the age of majority in their jurisdiction of residence, and does not use such information if Nissan discovers that it has been provided by a minor. If a child has already provided us with Personal Information, his or her parent or guardian may contact us for the purpose of deleting this information.
Nissan may use and disclose your Personal Information to:
manage our relationship with you, including to facilitate, complete or confirm any transaction or purchase of goods or services you choose to enter with us, including warranty coverage;

Your Personal Information may be disclosed or transferred to another company in the event of a transfer, change of ownership or assignment of all or part of Nissan or its assets or shares. This will occur only if the parties have entered into an agreement under which the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information is restricted to those purposes that relate to the business transaction, including a determination of whether or not to proceed with the business transaction, and is to be used by the parties to carry out and complete the business transaction.
Nissan may disclose your Personal Information to service providers, suppliers, vendors, contractors or agents that perform services, such as marketing and advertising campaigns, customer service and data hosting, on behalf of Nissan. Personal Information will only be provided to these organizations for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.
Nissan may also disclose your Personal Information to other third parties, for example, partners in promotional activities such as contests and marketing and/or promotional events. Personal Information will only be provided to these organizations in accordance with this Privacy Policy. The use of your Personal Information by these organizations is governed by their privacy policy.
Please note that there are circumstances where Nissan may use and/or disclose your Personal Information without your consent, such as when disclosure:
is permitted or required by law, court order, administrative agency or other governmental tribunal;
is necessary to protect the rights, privacy, safety or property of an identifiable person or group;
is necessary to establish or collect monies owing to Nissan;
is necessary to permit Nissan to pursue available remedies or limit any damages that Nissan may sustain; or

Nissan endeavors to ensure that any Personal Information in its control is as accurate, current and complete as necessary for the purposes for which Nissan uses or discloses that Personal Information.
4. Retention
Nissan retains Personal Information as long as Nissan believes it is necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected. Currently, Nissan holds Personal Information in Mississauga, Ontario; Denver, Colorado; and Sterling, VA. Nissan has in place a Records Retention Policy which outlines the procedures for the retention and subsequent disposition of Nissan records including those records that contain Personal Information.
Personal Information held by Nissan may be stored or hosted on servers in other countries, including the United States and, as a result, the governments, courts, law enforcement or regulatory agencies may require disclosure of your personal information without your consent under the applicable laws of such countries, including the USA Patriot Act.
5. Security
Nissan endeavors to maintain adequate physical, procedural and technical security with respect to its offices and information storage facilities so as to help prevent any loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, or modification of Personal Information.
When our credit application asks users to enter Personal Information, we use “Secure Socket Layers (“SSL”)” encryption technology to help safeguard your Personal Information.
Nissan further protects Personal Information by restricting access to it only to those employees and service providers that have a business need to know it to carry out the purposes indicated above, or such other purposes as may be permitted or required by the applicable law. Nissan has a policy under which employee misuse of Personal Information is treated as a serious offence for which disciplinary action may be taken.
