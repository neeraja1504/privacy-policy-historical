Privacy Statement - Nirvanix
Your privacy is important to us. We appreciate and take very seriously the trust you place in us. This Nirvanix Privacy Statement discloses our information practices for Nirvanix websites, including how information gathered by Nirvanix websites is used, tracked, and shared.
Information We Collect
You may choose to give us personal information for many reasons, such as your contact information when registering on our website to obtain services or inquiring about becoming a supplier or business partner, your credit card details to pay for services, or your education and work experience when applying for a job. If you tell us that you do not want us to use your information to make further contact with you beyond fulfilling your request, we will respect your wishes.
We also collect information about you to personalize your experience on our sites and customize our interactions with you. We do so through the use of "cookies". A cookie is a piece of data that a Web site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your computer as a tag that identifies your computer. You may be able to set your browser to notify you before you receive a cookie and you can also usually set your browser to turn off cookies. Allowing cookies may allow for a more personalized experience. For instance, by setting a cookie on this site, you would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on the site. If you reject the cookie, you may still use the site. You may be limited in some areas of the site. Some Nirvanix business partners use cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) on the site for purposes such as serving ads and measuring advertising effectiveness. Nirvanix, however, has no access to or control over their use of these cookies and is not responsible for the data collected through these cookies, or how any such collected data is used or shared by our business partners. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is anonymous.
Personal Information Use
We use your personal information to:
Deliver services and support;
Prevent and detect security threats or other malicious activity;
Send communications to you, such as service information, account summaries, promotional offers, and surveys;
Customize, analyze, and improve our services and communication with you;
Protect the rights of others, including preventing fraud and other illegal activities;
Contact you as you have requested related to your services, employment application, or other inquiry;
Protect the security or integrity of the website, our business, or our products or services; or
Otherwise, as disclosed to you at the point of collection.
Personal information collected may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which we maintain facilities, and by using our services, including our website, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.
Protecting Your Information
We are committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure, such as encryption, passwords, and physical security. We will not give, sell, rent, share, or trade any personal information about you to third parties or provide your personal information, including your name or electronic mail address, to third parties except as provided herein, or required by law, subpoena or court order. Nirvanix may disclose your username, name, address, electronic mail, and other personal information as it believes necessary or appropriate to protect the rights of others, such as in an investigation for fraud, intellectual property infringement, piracy, or other illegal activity as well as dispute resolution and enforcement of the Agreement. Nirvanix will share aggregated demographic information with its partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.
Nirvanix uses an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services. Nirvanix may partner with other parties to provide specific services. When you sign up for these services, Nirvanix will share names or other contact information as necessary for the third party to provide these services. These parties are not allowed to use your information except for the purpose of providing these services. While we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant that the personal information or private communications you transmit to us will always remain private, and you do so at your own risk.
Log Files
Nirvanix uses IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, and track you. IP addresses are linked to personal information for security and operational purposes only.
Links
This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Nirvanix is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each web site that collects personal information. This Statement applies solely to information collected by Nirvanix on the Nirvanix website.
Supplementing Information
Nirvanix may combine information about your purchasing habits with similar information from its partners to create a personalized user profile. When you make a purchase from one of our partners, the partner company may collect and share that purchase information with Nirvanix to better tailor the site to your preferences.

Protect the Rights of Others
We may also use or share your information to protect our rights or the rights of others, including our customers, business partners, or suppliers, when we have reasonable grounds to believe that such rights have been or could be affected. We reserve the right to disclose your personal information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, or the rights of others, or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or other legal process.
Notice of Changes
If we change this Statement, we will post the revised Statement so you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under which circumstances, if any, it is disclosed. We will provide the date of the update at the end of the Statement.
