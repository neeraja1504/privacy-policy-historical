3. The Information We Collect:
By visiting any of our NIKON Owned Websites, we collect non-personally identifiable information about you, and we may also collect personally identifiable information that you provide to us.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information is information that cannot be used to identify you or to contact you and is information not associated with a specific personal identity. It is information that we collect automatically from you by tracking your use of our NIKON Owned Websites by using technology and methodology that enables tracking, such as the use of cookies, and includes but is not limited to information, such as domain type, browser version, service provider, internet protocol address, time spent and pages visited on our NIKON Owned Websites as well as information searched for on our NIKON Owned Websites. A “cookie” is a small file that a website transfers to the hard drive of a visitor’s computer for record keeping purposes. This tracking through the use of cookies will not by itself reveal anything to us about you personally or provide us with any information that personally identifies you, such as your name, e-mail address or other personally identifiable information. Non-personally identifiable information is also information that you, at your option, voluntarily provide us while you are visiting one of our NIKON Owned Websites and includes but is not limited to information such as your hobbies and interests, gender, age, level of education, photographic skill level as well as your purchases of and your experience with our products.
Personally Identifiable Information is information that is associated with a person’s name or personal identity and can be used to identify or contact you. It includes but is not limited to such information as your name, postal address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, and credit/debit card information. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen (13).
4.  How We Use Collected Information
NIKON uses collected information to help us better understand your needs and interests so that we may provide you with better service. Specifically, we use personally identifiable information to help you complete a transaction or order with us, to respond to your inquiries and requests, to provide and update you on our customer services and support, to notify you of promotional or special offers, to communicate with you about our products and services, and to allow you to participate in an interactive feature. (See Section 10 below, “Your Privacy Preferences Regarding Personally Identifiable Information-Opting In/Out” regarding communications to you.) Personally identifiable information in the form of credit/debit card information is used only for payment processing and fraud prevention. We use non-personally identifiable information to increase the functionality and user friendliness of our NIKON Owned Websites as well as to improve the design, content and user experience of all of our NIKON Owned Websites. We may also use non-personally identifiable information for research purposes such as analyzing how visitors use and navigate our NIKON Owned Websites. In addition, we may take your personally identifiable information and make it non-personally identifiable, either by combining it with information about other individuals (aggregating your information with information about other individuals), or by removing characteristics, such as your name, that make the information personally identifiable to you, i.e., de-personalizing your information. Given the nature of this information, there are no restrictions under this privacy policy upon NIKON’s right to aggregate or de-personalize your personal identifiable information, and use and/or share with third parties the resulting non-personally identifiable information in any way.

NIKON also does not share your personally identifiable information with third parties except we may disclose personally identifiable information to companies affiliated with NIKON, such as our parent company, and/or unaffiliated third parties working on our behalf or for us or with us, such as agents, vendors and suppliers, but only for the purpose to enable them to fulfill your requests to us for product, services or information. All such affiliated and unaffiliated parties who have access to personally identifiable information are required to keep confidential such information and may not use it for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for NIKON and as otherwise required by law. Except as otherwise stated in this policy, NIKON will not share personally identifiable information with third parties without your permission, unless to (a) comply with any law, subpoena, regulation or court order; (b) respond to requests from governmental authorities; or (c) help prevent fraud or to protect the safety, rights, property or security of NIKON as well as that of third parties.
