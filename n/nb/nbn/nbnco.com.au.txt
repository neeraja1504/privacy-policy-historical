1. About us
nbn  is building Australia’s new broadband access network.
This policy describes how we handle your personal information.
NBN  Co ( nbn or the Company) was established in 2009 to design, build and operate Australia’s new fast, wholesale local access broadband network.
Our key objective is to ensure all Australians have access to fast broadband as soon as possible, at affordable prices, and at least cost. nbn  is a wholesaler, which means we give Australia’s telephone and internet providers access to the nbn ™ broadband access network. These providers then sell telephone and internet plans to Australian organisations and the public.

respond to applications, questions, requests or complaints that you have made to us or that have been passed to us by your internet or telephone service provider(s) or other parties ,

Telling you about the  nbn ™ access network
We are required by law to tell the public about the rollout of the nbn ™ access network, including when the network will be available in different areas and when connections to the old network will no longer work. To do this, we send letters to the homes and businesses in an area that are able to connect to the nbn ™ access network.
If you have signed up for email updates on the delivery of the nbn ™ access network, we will also send you emails about the network. You can opt out of receiving updates at any time by using the ‘unsubscribe’ link in the updates.
Using data to build a better network and give you better service
We’re always working to develop and improve the nbn ™ access network and our products and services.
One way we do this is by using new technologies that let us combine information we have with data from other sources, such as third party websites or the Australian Bureau of Statistics.
We also collect information about people that does not identify them, such as website and advertising analytics, and data from service providers.
This helps us learn more about how the nbn ™ access network is being or may be used, so we can better design, build and operate the network.
Where we work with partners or service providers to do this, we take steps to ensure that they are required to protect your information.
