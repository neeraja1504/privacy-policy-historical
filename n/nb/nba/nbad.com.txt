Disclosure of personal information
We allow third party service providers to process personal information where this is needed in connection with a service they provide NBAD. These arrangements may involve your personal information being located in various countries around the world including the United Arab Emirates where NBAD has its head office.
You should be aware that different privacy laws may apply in these countries from any laws that may apply in the country where you are located. NBAD will always strive to adopt the highest standards of privacy protection wherever your personal information is located.
Our privacy policy does not apply to third-party websites where our online advertisements are displayed or to linked third-party websites which we do not operate or control.
Monitoring
To the extent permitted by law, NBAD may record and monitor your communications with us to ensure compliance with our legal and regulatory obligations and our internal policies. This may include the recording of telephone conversations.
Right of Access
Subject to applicable law, regulations and/or banking industry guidelines, you may have the right to request a copy of the personal information processed in relation to you. NBAD may be allowed, by law, to charge a fee for providing you with a copy of your personal information.
To request a copy of your personal information, please contact us on AskSecurity@nbad.com.
Security
The security of your personal information is important to us and NBAD has invested significant resources to protect the safekeeping and confidentiality of your personal information. When using external service providers, we require that they adhere to the same standards as NBAD. Personal information may be transferred or stored at a location outside of your country of residence. Regardless of where personal information is transferred or stored, we take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that personal information is kept secure.
The Internet is not a secure form of communication and sending and receiving information over the Internet carries with it risks including the risk of access and interference by unauthorized third parties. Information passing over the Internet may be transmitted internationally (even when the sender and recipient are located in the same country) via countries with weaker privacy and data protection laws than your country of residence.
We do not accept responsibility or liability for the confidentiality, security or integrity of your personal information in connection with its transmission over the Internet.
Social media
NBAD operates channels, pages and accounts on some social media sites to inform, assist and engage with customers. We monitor and record comments and posts made on these channels about NBAD so that we can improve our services.
NBAD is not responsible for any information posted on those sites other than information we have posted ourselves. We do not endorse the social media sites themselves or any information posted on them by third parties.
When you engage with NBAD via social media, your personal information may be stored on that social media site’s servers which are outside the control of NBAD and may be held in the United States of America or elsewhere in the world. Any information posted to such sites may be accessed and read by the general public. NBAD will not ask you to share personal, account or security information via social media sites and you should not post such information on these channels.
Changes to this privacy policy
NBAD may in its absolute discretion update this privacy policy from time to time. It is therefore recommended that you review it regularly.
