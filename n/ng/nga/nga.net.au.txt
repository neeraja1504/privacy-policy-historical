This Privacy Policy for Acendre lets you know what personal information of yours we hold, what we do with it, who we will disclose it to and how you can access the personal information we hold about you. You can also find out here how to change inaccurate personal information and how to opt out of receiving communications from us.
What personal information about you does Acendre collect and hold?
Acendre does not collect Personal Information about you when you visit our website unless you choose to provide us with such information by submitting an online application to us or make an email enquiry. In relation to an online application, the information we collect will include any personal and sensitive information you provide to us to assess and process your application. In relation to email inquiries, this information will include your name, email address, address, employment or company details and any other information you provide to us in your inquiry.
If you decide to complete an online application form, the information you enter into the online form will only be collected by us if you submit your online application.
How does Acendre collect and hold your personal information?
Where possible, Acendre will generally collect your personal information directly from you. Acendre also collects personal information from its clients in the course of providing services to them. We may also collect personal information from our website, in promotional activities such as promotional events and competitions, from other directly related companies and, where you have provided your consent, from the organisers of events that we sponsor.
What does Acendre do with your personal information?
We will only use and disclose your personal information for the purposes which you provide it. In relation to inquiries you submit to us, we will use the information for the purposes of responding to your inquiry. In respect of online applications submitted to us, we will use this information to assess and process your application. In respect of personal information provided to us by our clients, we will use this information for the purpose of operating and maintaining our clients’ accounts, managing our services and fulfilling our legal and contractual obligations.
Who will Acendre disclose your personal information to?
Acendre may disclose your personal information to Acendre staff involved in processing your application or inquiry as well as referees and other third parties who may be required to assist us in processing your application. We may also disclose your personal information to advisors, consultants and contractors we ordinarily engage for the above purposes (such as lawyers, accountants and IT service providers). Due to the sensitive nature of some of the information that is gathered on behalf of our clients, we may also require applicants to undertake security and background clearance checks. Where this is necessary we will obtain your prior consent.
We may disclose your personal information to third party service providers overseas who are not subject to similar laws to the Australian Privacy Act 1988 (Cth). However, where your personal information is disclosed to an overseas recipient, we will also take adequate measures to ensure that the personal information is handled by the overseas recipient in accordance with the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and our instructions for the purposes described above. By providing Acendre with your personal information, you consent to this disclosure of your personal information.

Where we hold information that you are entitled to access, we will endeavour to provide you with a suitable range of choices as to how access is provided (eg emailing or mailing it to you). A fee may be charged to cover the cost of retrieval.
If at any time you believe that personal information we hold about you is incorrect, incomplete or inaccurate, then you may request amendment of it and we will either amend the information or make a record of your comment, as we think appropriate.
Marketing
Where we have obtained your consent to do so, or in circumstances where you would reasonably expect that your personal information would be used or disclosed for this purpose, we may contact you from time to time with marketing material about our other products or services.
