ReverbNation Privacy Policy
Welcome to ReverbNation.com ("RN"), owned, produced and operated by eMinor Inc. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any current, updated and new products and services ("Products and Services"), including the addition of new properties shall be subject to this Privacy Policy, as well as the General Terms and Conditions of Use ("Terms and Conditions"). By using RN you agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy and the Terms and Conditions, whether or not you register as a listener ("Listener" or "Fan"). Please read this Privacy Policy carefully.
RN is a music-oriented content and information website that provides a service to musical artists and to record companies on behalf of musical artists (each an "Artist" or "Musician" and collectively "Artists" or "Musicians") to post information regarding themselves as well as musical content owned and/or created by them. RN members can view each other's profiles ("Profiles"), communicate with each other, share photos, post journals and comments, and describe their interests. Registered Listeners can change their Profile information at any time and can control how other Listeners and the service communicates with them. Listeners and Artists are sometimes referred to hereinafter individually and collectively as "Users."
RN cares about online privacy. If you have any questions concerning this privacy policy, please email us at privacy@reverbnation.com.
INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE BY RN
RN collects User submitted personal information such as name, mailing address, email address, telephone number and age to authenticate Users, and to send notifications to those Users relating to, without limitation, the RN service, special events, contests and special offers.
As is standard practice on many corporate websites, RN also logs non-personally-identifiable information including IP address, profile information, aggregate user data, and browser type, from Listeners and other visitors to the site. This data is used to improve the website services, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. RN will not use the information collected to market directly to that person. This non-personally-identifiable information may be shared with third-parties to provide more relevant services and advertisements to Listeners. User IP addresses are recorded for security and monitoring purposes.
In addition RN uses pixel tags - tiny graphic images - to tell us what parts of our website have been visited or to measure the effectiveness of searches customers perform on our site. Pixel tags also enable us to send email messages in a format that customers can read. And they tell us whether emails have been opened to assure that we're only sending messages that are of interest to our customers. RN stores all of this information in a secure database.
Listener Profile information including Listeners' pictures and first names is displayed to people in order to facilitate user interaction in the RN social networking community. Listeners' full names are never directly revealed to other Listeners.
RN may also use a Listener's email address to send updates, a newsletter or news regarding the service. RN may send email messages which use a "click-through URL" linked to content on the RN website. When a customer clicks one of these URLs, they pass through our web server before arriving at the destination web page. RN tracks this click-through data to help determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked simply avoid clicking text or graphic links in the email.
From time to time, RN or a partner may sponsor a promotion, sweepstake or contest on RN. Listeners may be asked to provide personal information including name, email address or home address or to answer questions in order to participate. RN may transfer personal information to certain ad partners that you have explicitly requested to receive information from. It will be clear at the point of collection who is collecting the personal information and whose privacy statement will apply.
RN may also collect information for market research purposes to gain a better understanding of our customers and thus provide more valuable service. RN also collects information regarding customer activities on our website, and on related websites. This helps us to determine how best to provide useful information to customers and to understand which parts of our websites and Internet services are of most interest to them.
USE OF COOKIES

THIRD PARTY ADVERTISING
RN or one of our web-advertising partners may deliver ads appearing on RN to Listeners. Our web-advertising partners may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad servers may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on. This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This privacy statement covers only the use of cookies by RN and does not cover the use of cookies by any third party advertisers. Please be aware, however, that Google uses the DART cookie when delivering ads to our website. Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy.
SECURITY
RN Listener and Artist accounts are secured by Listener-created and Artist-created (as applicable) passwords. RN takes precautions to insure that account information is kept private. RN uses reasonable measures such as encryption to protect private information that is stored within our database against loss, theft, and misuse, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction, and we restrict access to such private information to those employees who need access to perform their job functions, such as our customer service personnel and technical staff. Please note that RN cannot guarantee the security of Listener or Artist account information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of member information at any time. Users are urged to also take precautions to protect their personal data by changing passwords often using a combination of letters and numbers, and using a secure web browser. For any additional information about the security measures RN uses on our website, please contact us at privacy@reverbnation.com.
