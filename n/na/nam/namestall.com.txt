This applies to all information that you provide through any method of communication with NameStall. As such, your individual information is confidential. Any data that we gather are used by NameStall solely for the purpose of helping us serve you better. NameStall takes your privacy very seriously. We pledge to be as or even more stringent than any laws related to the collection of data while following our own strict policies and standards.
Membership Data
Once you have signed up for our service, you have joined as a member. We only collect and maintain data that has been knowingly given to us by you as a consumer or member.

Remember, when you provide or update information, any and all transmission of personal data is done through our secure server and secure server software so that your data is protected. In this way, we encrypt all such transmissions and further protect the data after transmission against unauthorized access in our secure data storage.
Domain Name Searches & Ideas
We do not share your domain name ideas or domain keyword lists and never register any domains that you have found or selected as potential candidates for registration.
However, we do not also reserve any domain names for our users. If you find available domain names, you are at your own risk to register them as soon as possible.
Only when you share or submit your domain name ideas or suggestions to our user domain suggestions section, we disclose your ideas. And we never register any domain name when a user domain name is in pending condition. Just because of extensive abuse and junk & rubbish domain name suggestions we keep users� domain name suggestions in pending queue (waiting for approval). And we manually check all submitted pending domain names to avoid abuse and maintain quality suggestion list.
Keyword Statistics
NameStall uses the aggregated keyword data for statistical purposes - for example �1000 Top Words� keywords used during some time period. The keywords in the statistics are never published unless there have been at least several hundred query occurrences.
Google Keyword Statistics
We manually grab data from google keyword tool for your high paying keywords domain search list. And we do not update those data (like keyword, competition, global monthly search volume, cpc) everyday or frequently. For top popular domain keywords it is same. So data may not match with google�s latest data (as google updates them frequently) sometimes. Please use those data at your own risk.
