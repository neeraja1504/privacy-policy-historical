DATA CONTROLLER ROLES
We collect and processes your Registrant Data to carry out the registration of your domain, to ensure that your registration functions as expected, and that registrations do not affect the security of our registrar. In order to enter your chosen domain name into our system, we are required to process your data in a manner obligated in our contracts with Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (“ICANN”). In this respect, it is our understanding under applicable law that we act as a joint data controller of your Registrant Data, working in conjunction with the TLD registry and ICANN, as herein described.

collection of registration data;
providing you notice and an opportunity to review both our Privacy Policy and the privacy policy of the relevant registry;
providing you with adequate information and a means by which you may exercise your individual privacy rights, such as data access, deletion, and rectification; and

See the list of specific privacy policies, that relate to each TLD here. If you do not understand such policies, or you have questions regarding any of their policies, you should discuss this with the registry operator of your chosen domain, prior to registering via our service.
