HOW INFORMATION IS COLLECTED ON THE SITE
Information Collected Through Google Analytics.
We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”) to collect certain information relating to your use of the Site.  Google Analytics uses “cookies” to help the website analyze how users use the Site.  The information generated by the cookie about your use of the Site (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers.  Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Site, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage.  Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google’s behalf.  Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google.  You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser, however please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this Site.  By using this Site, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner and for the purposes set out above.  For more information regarding Google Analytics please visit Google's website, and pages that describe Google Analytics, such as www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html.
Information Collected Through Cookies and Similar Technologies.
A “cookie” is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website.  When you visit the website again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser.  Cookies may store unique identifiers, user preferences and other information.  As is standard practice on many corporate web sites, our web site uses cookies and other technologies to help us understand which parts of our web sites are the most popular, where our visitors are going, and how much time they spend there.  We also use cookies and other technologies to make sure that our online advertising is bringing customers to our products and services.  We use cookies and other technologies to study traffic patterns on our web site, to make it even more rewarding as well as to study the effectiveness of our customer communications.  And we use cookies to customize your experience and provide greater convenience each time you interact with us.  You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.  However, some Site features or services may not function properly without cookies.
As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.  This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.   We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.  NUSA will not use the information collected to market directly to that person.
In some of our email messages we use a “click-through URL” linked to content on our web site.  When customers click one of these URLs, they pass through our web server before arriving at the destination web page.  We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications.  If you prefer not to be tracked simply avoid clicking text or graphic links in the email.
In addition we use pixel tags—tiny graphic images—to tell us what parts of our web site customers have visited or to measure the effectiveness of searches customers perform on our site.  Pixel tags also enable us to send e-mail messages in a format customers can read.  And they tell us whether e-mails have been opened to ensure that we’re sending only messages that are of interest to our customers.  We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to a customer.  We store all of this information in a secure database located in the United States.
USE AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION

NUSA does not sell or rent your contact information to other marketers.  To help us provide superior service, your personal information may be shared with legal entities within our corporate group globally who will take steps to safeguard it in accordance with our privacy policy.

Finally we may also disclose information about you if we determine that for national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary.  Finally, we will share personal information if we believe, in our sole discretion, that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to respond to any subpoena or enforceable governmental request; to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of NUSA, our users, customers or the public as required or permitted by law.

HOW NUSA PROTECTS YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
NUSA takes precautions—including administrative, technical, and physical measures—to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft, and misuse, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.  Our web sites use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption on all web pages where personal information is required to make online purchases you must use an SSL-enabled browser in order to protect the confidentiality of your personal and credit card information while it’s transmitted over the Internet. You can help us by also taking precautions to protect your personal data when you are on the Internet. Change your passwords often using a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure web browser.  While we make every effort to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party “hackers” from illegally obtaining your personal information.
INTEGRITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
NUSA has safeguards in place to keep your personal information accurate, complete, and up to date for the purposes for which it is used.  You always have the right to access and correct the personal information you have provided and can help us ensure that your contact information and preferences are accurate, complete, and up to date by contacting us as provided in the “Contact Us” Section below.
CHILDREN
Protecting children’s privacy is especially important to us.  NUSA recognizes that parents, guardians, or other adults often engage our services for family use, including use by minors.  We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 for marketing purposes, but because some information is collected electronically, it can appear to be the personal information of NUSA purchaser of the product, and will be treated as such by this privacy policy.  If a child under 13 submits personal information to NUSA and we learn that that personal information is the information of a child under 13, we will attempt to delete the information as soon as possible.  It is our policy to comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and all other applicable laws.  Therefore we restrict our web site to persons 18 years or older.
YOU MUST BE EIGHTEEN (18) YEARS OR OLDER TO ACCESS THE SITE.  IF YOU ARE UNDER EIGHTEEN YEARS OF AGE, YOU ARE NOT PERMITTED TO ACCESS THE SITE FOR ANY REASON.
FOREIGN VISITORS

OTHER WEBSITES
The Site also contains links to sites operated by third parties, which are not owned or controlled by NUSA.  Once you leave our site, you may or may not see a new URL in the location bar.  Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other websites.  If you provide any information to websites operated by third parties, different rules regarding the collection and use of your personal information may apply.  We strongly suggest you review such third party’s privacy policies before providing any information to them.  You should contact these entities directly if you have any questions about their use of the information that they collect.
