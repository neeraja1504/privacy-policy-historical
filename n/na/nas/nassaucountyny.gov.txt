Personal Information and Choice
"Personal information" is information about an individual that is readily identifiable to that specific individual. Personal information includes personal identifiers such as an individual's name, address, business address, e-mail address and phone number.
We will not collect personal information about you unless you participate in an activity that requests information (i.e. sending an e-mail or participating in a survey). If you do not to participate in these activities, your choice will in no way affect your ability to use any other feature of the County's website.
If you provide the County with personal information, such as sending an e-mail to the County Executive, to any County employee, or by filling out and submitting an online form located on the County's website, the County will treat such e-mails and submitted online forms the same way it treats letters to any County department.
The collection of personal information requested from or volunteered by children on-line or by email will be treated the same as information provided by an adult.
Public Disclosure
Nassau County strives to protect personally identifiable information by collecting only information necessary to deliver our services. All information that may be collected at this site becomes public record that may be subject to inspection and copying by the public, unless an exemption in law exists. For instance, if personal information is requested or volunteered, County rules and regulations, New York State FOIL law, or other Federal statutes may protect it from disclosure. Unless confidentiality is specifically authorized by law, no privilege or protection from disclosure is warranted or otherwise implied by the County.
In the event of a conflict between this Privacy Policy and any applicable law governing disclosure, the governing law is controlling.
