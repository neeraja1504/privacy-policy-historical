How voluntarily provided information is used
If you voluntarily send us information, i.e. you fill out a form requesting information, it will be used for governmental purposes only, although it would be subject to disclosure to the extent required by law by the State of Tennessee’s Open Records Act. Such governmental purposes could include, without limitation:

To keep lists of interested people (e.g. prospective vendors or employees)
We will not rent or sell information identifying you as a particular person (name, address, phone number, etc.) to third parties, without your express permission, although again, this information would be subject to disclosure to the extent required by law by the State of Tennessee’s Open Records Act, and we may charge a fee to recover any costs expended in responding to a request under that act. We will not disclose credit card information, except for purposes related to your credit card transaction, or with your permission.
Our policy on "cookies"
A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a session ID that the site uses to track the pages you've visited, but the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Some parts of this web site, like http://ebid.nashville.gov, use cookies to track user sessions. We do this in order to determine if an individual has left the site and needs to log in again. The passive cookies used on this site do not remember you each time you visit the site.
If you prefer not to receive cookies while browsing our web site, you can set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies and refuse the cookie when your browser alerts you to its presence. You can also refuse all cookies by turning them off in your browser, although you may not be able to take full advantage of this web site if you do so. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use or navigate through many parts of our web site, except access to certain web pages that require a login and password.

Use of Nashville.gov by Children
We do not specifically solicit information from minors or information that will enable us to determine if the user is a minor. Since we do not restrict users based on their ages, we would like to ask parents to assist their children when children are asked to provide personal information on line. We will also ask that children get their parents' permission before providing any information on line. Any information submitted by a minor, will be treated as information submitted by an adult, since we are not able to determine the user's actual age.

If you wish to use any of this content, you must obtain permission from the copyright holder before reproducing or otherwise using those graphics/images.

Security
The Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County (“Metro”) is committed to the responsible use of the information entrusted to it and to protecting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of that information. However, information security in not an absolute and Metro cannot absolutely guarantee the security of the information that it handles. Metro does strive to maintain a reasonable continuous process for implementing, reviewing and improving data security.
We aspire to fully protect citizen information through the use of multiple information security controls, including technical, administrative and physical controls.
