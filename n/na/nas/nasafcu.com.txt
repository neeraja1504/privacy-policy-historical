Website Privacy
As a general policy, we do not automatically collect personal information from our website users. We do collect and store information on the domain used to access our website, the Internet address of the website from which a user links to the Credit Union's website and the date and time of the visit to our website. This information is used only to measure the number of visitors to our website and the route a user travels while within the Credit Union's website to better serve users in improved design and site navigation.
Online Banking
Personal identification, such as your account number and password, is collected when a valid Credit Union member with active Credit Union account(s) enters the secure online banking area of the Credit Union's website. This information enables the Credit Union to regulate access of this information to those who request such access and those entitled to perform transactions on these
account(s).
Cookies
Our website may use cookies (small pieces of information sent by our web server to a visitor's web browser that reminds our site about the user the next time he or she visits). We do not store confidential or sensitive information in cookies. We use cookies only to enhance a member's online banking session and ease navigation through our website.
For certain applications, such as online banking, cookies are required to help protect the privacy of a member's transactions by, for example, automatically terminating the online session if the member forgets to log out (also see "Third Party Service Checks" below). Cookies cannot be used to capture a user's email address, obtain data from the user's hard drive or gain confidential or sensitive information about the user. Additionally, cookies cannot be read by a website other than the one that set the cookie. Some websites, however, use cookies to obtain information from the user's browser. The user has the option to set his or her browser to notify before accepting a cookie to control whether a cookie is accepted or rejected.
It's important to note that the information we use about you helps us provide you with products, services and experiences that benefit you. You have the ability to control how your non-personal information is collected and used online.
Some websites may belong to ad networks that use your browsing history across websites to choose which ads to display on their sites; the displayed ads may include advertising for NASA FCU. To learn more, and to opt out of seeing interest-based advertisements on these sites, visit the Network Advertising Initiative home page. Please note that even if you choose to remove your information (opt out), you will still see advertisements while you're browsing online. However the advertisements you see may be less relevant to you and your interests.
Third Party Service Checks
To protect you, we may use tools and services provided by third-parties to help us decide whether to accept submissions from personal computers, mobile phones, or other devices. These third-party providers may check whether user devices have been identified with fraudulent or abusive transactions in the past, such as reported instances of identity theft, account takeovers, or malware attacks. For this purpose, a cookie, flash storage token, or other code file may be placed on your device to identify it in the future when you visit our website or connect with our other online applications. If you set your browser or device to reject these cookies or tokens, you may not be able to access some features of our website or other online applications.
When you access our website or other online applications, we will transmit this third-party device identification code to the third-party provider, along with data concerning certain technical attributes of your device such as the model, operating system, and browser version, as well as the IP address (all of which are used to confirm device identification). We may then receive information from these third-party providers indicating that submissions from a user’s device should not be accepted. We may also inform such third-party providers if we determine that a device has been used in connection with a fraudulent or abusive transaction with us. In addition, in certain situations, we may share with one or more of these third-party providers certain personal identifying information and information about the device you are using. If your receive a message from us indicating that a requested submission has not been processed, we will provide appropriate customer service contact information.

NASA Federal Credit Union provides several online forms (for example, loan application or check order) to better serve the needs of members. Personal information provided via any Credit Union online form is used only to process the member's request for service. These forms are transmitted via secured means.

Email Communication
We may use personal information you transmit to us to respond to inquiries for service or information, or improve the service the Credit Union provides. Since email communication may not be secure against interception by unauthorized individuals, users may want to seek alternatives to email when it is necessary to provide sensitive or personal information.
NASA Federal Credit Union will not transmit sensitive or personal information that can compromise or violate a user's privacy when communicating via email.
