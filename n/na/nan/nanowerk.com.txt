I. OUR COMMITMENT TO PRIVACY
Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.
II. THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT
This notice applies to all information collected or submitted through the Nanowerk websites, including information you submit when subscribing to our Nanowerk Spotlight service, or when subscribing to one of our Nanowerk newsletters. The types of personal information we may collect include your name, your organization's name, address, email address, telephone number and, if you are ordering products through us or subscribing to one of our newsletters, your credit card information.
III. THE WAY WE USE INFORMATION WE COLLECT
We use the information you provide about yourself when subscribing to our Nanowerk Spotlight service, or when subscribing to one of our Nanowerk newsletters, only to provide you with the information or service you have requested. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to transmit to you the requested information or service.
We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.
We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our websites and services that we provide through our websites, and also to promote and better explain our services to our business affiliates. For example, we may tell a business affiliate that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our web site, or that Y number of individuals ordered a certain type of product during a given time period through our web site. However, we do not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals when sharing aggregated information with our business affiliates.
Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.
IV. OUR ADVERTISING PARTNERS
We use third-party advertising companies such as Google to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click here.

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
VI. OUR COMMITMENT TO CHILDRENS'PRIVACY
Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our web site from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our web site is structured to attract anyone under 13.
