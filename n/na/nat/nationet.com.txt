PROVISION OF PROFESSIONAL SERVICES
21. KPMG Nunwood will also often receive personal information in the course of providing professional services – ordinarily when we provide services to private individuals, employers, businesses with personal customers, and public sector clients with constituents. Our engagement letter and terms of business govern our relationship with clients, including what we may do with personal data that is provided to us. KPMG Nunwood provides many different types of services and its role may not always be visible to the individuals who are data subjects.
22. Accordingly, if you have a privacy query or concern you should first contact your employer or the relevant organisation with whom you have a relationship (e.g. your bank). They will be in the best position to advise you.
23. More generally, KPMG Nunwood complies with its obligations under the Data Protection Act 1998, and applicable regulatory guidance which relates to our handling of personal data (for example, as published by our principal regulators, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales) and the Market Research Society. Regulatory information about KPMG can be found here.

If we make changes, we will record the date of amendment or modification in the Privacy Statement. The revised Privacy Statement will apply to you and your information from that date. We would encourage you to review this Privacy Statement periodically to check if there are any changes in how we are treating your personal data.
