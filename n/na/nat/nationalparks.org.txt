Privacy Policy | National Park Foundation
(Updated 6-1-17)
The National Park Foundation, publisher of nationalparks.org and its related content and services, believes that electronic privacy is crucial for the ongoing success of the Internet as a communications medium. On occasion, The National Park Foundation will make available to potential partners aggregated results from research it has conducted on the nationalparks.org visitor base. The National Park Foundation will only provide such demographic information on an aggregated basis and as a policy does not disclose individual visitor information.
Donor Privacy:
The National Park Foundation is committed to respecting the privacy of our donors. We will not sell or rent your personal information to any third party. Your credit card, banking, and/or other financial information will not be used outside of our organization. You may choose to remain an anonymous donor at any time. We subscribe and adhere to the Association of Fundraising Professionals (AFP) Bill of Rights, which you may view online at www.afpnet.org.
The National Park Foundation protects your personal information from loss, misuse, alteration, or unauthorized disclosure by encrypting the data which you provide us with current encryption tools, including HTTPS (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure) and SSL (Secure Socket Layer) protocols and by requiring employees with access to personal data to comply with our privacy policy. We operate secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall and password protection systems. Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary and only authorized individuals have access to the information provided by our customers.
Use of Third Parties
On occasion, the National Park Foundation may supply personal information with third parties to perform services on our behalf, such as data processing, marketing support, analytics, etc. Your personal information is provided to these third parties only as needed to perform services on behalf of the National Park Foundation. These partners may also combine your email information with other information they have access to such as mailing address so that we may serve relevant marketing offers to you via email and direct mail. These third parties are contractually obligated to maintain the confidentiality and security of all personal information supplied.
Exchange with Other Organizations
We sometimes partner with other, similar organizations to enable fundraising for the National Park Foundation. We will honor opt-out requests from donors to be removed from exchanges with other similar organizations. To request to be removed from future exchanges, please contact our Donor Services group through the contact information below.

The Information We Collect:
We are committed to protecting the privacy of visitors to this Site. Physical, electronic and managerial procedures have been employed to safeguard the security and integrity of personal information. Except for the use of cookies as discussed below, we collect personal information from you on this Site only when it is specifically and knowingly provided by you. The National Park Foundation does not currently collect or archive any/all personal information sent to us on an individual basis. All information is collected and analyzed solely on an aggregated basis.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever The National Park Foundation sponsors any contest or sweepstakes or other promotion (each a "Promotion"), any personally identifiable information ("PI") you may submit as a participant in such Promotions will be used and archived in accordance with the rules of each such Promotion. National Park Foundation may use the PI to contact you to (i) provide you with information and news from the National Park Foundation, (ii) to request charitable donations or (iii) to advertise other Promotions. National Park Foundation may share the PI with third parties who are involved with the Promotion. Such third parties will be identified in the rules associated with the individual Promotion, and these third parties may contact you in accordance with their own privacy policies. By entering the Promotion, you agree to the foregoing description of how PI may be used. If you read the rules of any given Promotion and do not wish to be contacted by the National Park Foundation or the third parties involved in the Promotion, you may opt-out by not entering the Promotion. The National Park Foundation will not sell PI or otherwise transfer PI to third parties except as stated in this Policy.  If, in the future, The National Park Foundation collects or archives PI on an individual basis in circumstances other than for Promotions, such a Policy change will be posted on the Site.  If at any time you wish to correct/add/remove the PI submitted to this Site, please contact us at ask-npf@nationalparks.org.
The National Park Foundation will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on The National Park Foundation or the Site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of The National Park Foundation or the Site; and (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Site or the public.
Child Privacy:
The National Park Foundation does not knowingly solicit or collect personally identifiable information online from children under the age of 13 without prior verifiable parental consent except where otherwise permitted under The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and FTC Rule; e.g., for contests, online newsletters, homework help and electronic postcards.
If The National Park Foundation learns that a child under the age of 13 has submitted personally identifiable information online, in contravention of these measures, it will take all reasonable measures to delete such information from its databases and to not use such information for any purpose (except where necessary to protect the safety of the child or others or as required by law).

All consumer transactions and purchases on this Site are transmitted in a secured environment using VeriSign 128-bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption. This ensures that all transactions and purchases you send to us via the World Wide Web will be encrypted. If any other Internet user intercepts the communication, he/she will only be able to see it in an encrypted (garbled) form.
