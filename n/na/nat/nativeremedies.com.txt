Service providers: To provide you the best possible service and products, we provide information to outside companies that help us deliver the products and services offered. For example, we may work with an outside company to manage a database of customer information or to distribute our emails.
At times we may partner with outside vendors to provide additional services or products outside those offered by NativeRemedies.com.

How do we use Cookies?
A "cookie" is a small file stored on your computer by a web site that gathers certain information about your computerâ€™s activity on the site (but not specifically who is using it). We use cookies to track activity and enable the interaction of our website with visitors for such things as adding items to your shopping cart and allow us to associate the cookie with other customer information you have provided us. That customer information is stored on our secured database.
Our cookies do not store any personal or financial information about you. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies and allow you to disable the use of cookies. However, if you disable this feature, certain aspects of the Native Remedies web site, such as the shopping basket and "My Account" will not function properly.
Pixel Tags or Web Beacons
"Pixel tags" or "Web beacons" are small graphic files that allow us to monitor the use of our websites and may be placed inside emails to allow us to track certain activity. Tracked activity includes such things as being able to tell if the email was opened, how many times a recipient opened the email, whether or not they clicked a link and how many links were clicked.
