Privacy Policy | National Accident Helpline
National Accident Helpline is committed to protecting your personal information.
When you use our sites and services we want you to be confident that your personal information is safe and secure. This Privacy Policy explains the following:
how we collect your personal information
what personal information we collect
how we use your personal information
who we share your personal information with; and
your rights under General Data Protection Regulation.
Who we are
We are National Accident Helpline Limited (company number 02857601) and our registered address is 1430 Montagu Court, Kettering Parkway, Kettering, NN15 6XR (referred to as “we” or “us” or “our”). We are registered as a data controller with the Information Commissioner’s Office with registration number Z4979903 for the purpose of the Data Protection Act 1998 (the “Act”). Our Data Protection Officer can be contacted at feedback@nahl.co.uk.
This policy (together with our Privacy Notice and any other documents referred to in it) sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed. Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices about your personal data and how we will treat it.
A reference to “you” or “your” is a reference to a user of our site and/or our services.
How we collect information about you
We may obtain personal information from you through our websites, mobile applications or other similar devices, channels or applications operated by, or on behalf of, any of the following brands:
National-Accident-Helpline.co.uk
Underdog.co.uk
If you request a call back or if you call us directly, we will store the information you give us. All calls to our contact centre are recorded for training and regulatory purposes.
What personal information do we collect
Information about you and your claim
The information we collect may include your name, address, contact details (such as email address and phone number), date of birth, personal description and/or photograph, insurance details (which will include your name and address as well as other personal information), national insurance number, financial information, details regarding your health and injury and any other information relevant to your claim.
Processing Data Provided by third Parties
It’s important to us that our service is accessible to all accident victims. While we always try to get consent from the injured party before processing their personal data, this isn’t always possible (e.g. where the accident victim is a child, non-English speaker, elderly/infirm relative or where the injured party has consented to another person to provide his or her details to us). In these cases, it will be necessary for us to take details from a third party e.g. the parent of a child, translator, friend or relative. We will always ask the person providing the Personal Information whether the injured party has consented to the processing of their information.  The response to this question will be documented either by call recordings and/or noted on our internal systems. Information relating to the third party and the injured party will be collected by us in accordance with this policy.
