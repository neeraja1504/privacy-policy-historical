We know that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. This notice describes our privacy policy. By visiting this site, you are accepting the practices described in this privacy policy notice.
Order
We request information from the user on our order form. Here a user must provide contact information (like name and shipping address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customers orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user.
Information Request
We may also request your e-mail address or mailing address for the purposes of providing additional services (for example, subscriptions to e-mail newsletters or announcement lists). Whenever we request the identity of a visitor, we will clearly indicate the purpose of the inquiry before the information is requested. We maintain a strict “no-spam” policy that means that we do not sell, rent, or otherwise give your e-mail address to a third-party, without your consent or as permitted by this privacy policy.
Remarketing:
We may remarket your information. Remarketing is a way for us to connect with users, based upon your past interactions with the NaturalBreakthroughsResearch.com website. Third-party marketing vendors may be hired by Natural Breakthroughs Research to perform remarketing services. As a result, third-party vendors, including Google, may show Natural Breakthroughs Research ads on sites on the internet. Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a user’s prior visits to Natural Breakthroughs Research‘s website.
