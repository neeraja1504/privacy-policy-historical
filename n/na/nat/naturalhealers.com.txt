Natural Healers | Privacy Policy
Information Collection and Use
We collect personal contact information (“Contact Information”) only if it is entered. The types of Contact Information that may be collected include: name, address, email address, telephone number, fax number and information about your educational interests. This Contact Information is passed on to the schools you identify (sometimes through a vendor that is under contract to the school), so that they may contact you with more information. We may share your Contact Information with our email service provider or business partners who use the data for the purpose of delivering All Star Directories Customer Service and marketing information to you and for other purposes permitted in this Privacy Policy. In addition, we may use your Contact Information to contact you if an inquiry you start on our Website is unable to be completed. Other personally identifiable Contact Information may be shared as required to fulfill your information request or when a business partner provides a product or service that we feel may be of interest to you.
Contact Information is aggregated to create reports on overall education industry trends, which may be sold to third parties. Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy. Please note that use of your Contact Information by a school or third party is governed by such school’s or third party’s privacy policy. You should consult the third party’s privacy policy, as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.
Information Sharing
All Star may share your Contact Information with our service providers who use the information for purposes related to the delivery of marketing and communication materials to our visitors. Every communication we send has links allowing the recipient to unsubscribe or change his or her preferences.
Opt-out
Please note that use of your Contact Information by a school or third party is governed by such school’s or third party’s privacy policy and you will need to separately opt out from that third party’s use of such information.
