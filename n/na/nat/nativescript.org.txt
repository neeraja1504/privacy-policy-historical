Google Analytics.  We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc., to evaluate your use of the Telerik Properties, compile reports on activity, and provide other services relating to Internet usage. Google Analytics uses first-party cookies that store information, such as what time the current visit occurred, whether the visitor has been to the Sites before, and what site referred the visitor to the web page.
We have also implemented Display Advertising Remarketing with Google Analytics to advertise online. This means that third-party vendors, including Google, display our ads on sites across the Internet and that we and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie, see: http://www.google.com/doubleclick) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on your past visits to the Telrik Properties.
Google classifies Google Analytics data as confidential information, governed by Google's privacy policies. Google’s privacy policy can be viewed at http://www.google.com/intl/None/policies/privacy/.

If you choose, you can opt out of the processing of data about you by Google for Display Advertising and/or customize the ads by using Google’s Ads Settings at: http://www.google.com/settings/ads. You can opt out of the processing of data about you by Google generally by turning off cookies in the preferences settings in your browser, or by downloading and installing Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on at http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout. The add-on communicates with the Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js) to indicate that information about the visit to the applicable Telerik Property should not be sent to Google Analytics. The Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on does not prevent information from being sent to the the applicable Telerik Property itself or to other web analytics services. For more information on Google Analytics, please visit https://www.google.com/analytics/.
