(“NATPE” or “we” or “us” or “our”) in facilitating the “Services,” as defined in the Terms of Use, on behalf of NATPE through www.NATPE.com and other online communication tools connected thereto (together referred to as the “Site”). Our Privacy Policy applies to all visitors, members, and others who access, post, comment, purchase, or attend the Services (“Users”).
Because an essential function of the Site is performing customized matches and business searches largely based upon the information you input you allow us to use any information you provide to us for this purpose. Please read the information below to learn what types of information we are collecting and what may happen to that information you input to and through the Site.
Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. The Privacy Policy is incorporated into and made a part of our Terms of Use. Any terms we use in this Policy without defining them have the definitions given to them in the Terms of Use. As part of the Terms of Use, the Privacy Policy constitutes a legally binding agreement between you and us. By accessing, using, or receiving the Site, you agree that you have read, understand, and are bound by the terms and conditions set forth herein and you hereby consent that we will collect, use, and share your information, including your name and email address, in the ways further detailed below.
If you do not agree with any part of this Privacy Policy or our Terms of Use, please do not use, access, or receive the Services.
This means that other Users may search for, see, use, or share any of your User Content that you make available through the Service, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use.
1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT
In order to better provide Users with our numerous services, we collect two types of information about our Users: Personally Identifiable Information and Nonpersonally Identifiable Information. Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience while using our Site.
A. Personally Identifiable Information : This refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are. When you engage in certain activities on this site, such as creating a user account, registering for a membership, program, conference and/or exhibition, ordering a product or service, submitting content and/or posting content in discussion forums or other public areas, entering a contest or sweepstakes, filling out a survey, or sending us feedback, we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself by filling out and submitting an online form. It is completely optional for you to engage in these activities. If you elect to engage in these activities, however, we may ask that you provide us personal information, such as your first and last name, mailing address (including zip code), email address, website, employer, job title and department, telephone and facsimile numbers, and other personal identifying information. When ordering products or services or registering for a membership, program, conference or exhibition on the site, you may be asked to provide a credit card number. Depending upon the activity, some of the information we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity.
B. Nonpersonally Identifiable Information : This refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual. We gather certain information about you based upon where you visit on our site in several ways. This information is compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis. This information may include the Web site's Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”) that you just came from, which URL you next go to, what browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address. A URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web. An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (“TCP/IP”) network, such as the World Wide Web. Networks like the Web use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address of the destination. In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the web, allowing web servers to locate and identify your computer. Computers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet. The following are example of nonpersonally identifiable information we collect:
i. Email open and click-throughs —We collect information about whether you have opened email messages from us and/or clicked on links in those emails. This helps us evaluate the relevance of the content in our communications.
ii. Visits to shortcut website addresses—Some published website addresses such as are shortcuts that redirect you to a page with a longer address. When a redirect is initiated, we log shortcut website address, date, time, and IP address.
iii. Log-ins and attempted log-ins—When you create a user account, log in, log out, or attempt to log in with invalid credentials, we record the date, time, your user ID (if you are logged in), IP address, the website address (URL) you accessed, web browser type, and a description of the event, which would include the email address you registered your account with.
2. Collection Methods and Use of Information
We do not collect any Personally Identifiable Information about you unless you voluntarily provide it to us. You provide certain Personally Identifiable Information to us when you: (a) register for our Services; (b) enter contests sponsored by us or one of our partners; (c) sign up for special offers from us or our Affiliates; (d) send email messages, submit forms or transmit other information through any means to us; (e) use the Site to send messages to other Users; or (f) submit your credit card or other payment information when ordering and purchasing our Services on our Site. We may also collect information from you at other points on our Site that state that such information is being collected.
In addition, we may also collect, or our third party ad server and/or content server may collect, certain Nonpersonally Identifiable Information. This information is ultimately stored in the form of store categories, and, in some cases, specific URLs. We use your IP address to diagnose problems with our servers, software, to administer our site and to gather demographic information. Our third party ad servers will also provide us with summary, but not individual, reports that will tell us how many ads were presented and clicked upon at out site.
We will primarily use your Personally Identifiable Information to provide our Services to you, as required by our agreements with you. We will also use your Personally Identifiable Information to compile lists/directories/databases of attendees/participants/speakers/members/providers/exhibitors connected to our Services, to match Users, to enhance the operation of our Site, to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze use of the Site, to improve our Service offerings, and to customize our Site's content, layout, and Services. We may use Personally Identifiable Information to deliver information to you and to contact you regarding administrative notices. We may also use Personally Identifiable Information to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our agreements with you, including our Terms of Use, Copyright Dispute Policy, and this Private Policy.
3. Release of Information
We do provide some of our services through contractual arrangements with our Affiliates, services providers, and other third parties. We and our Affiliates use your Personally Identifiable Information to operate our Site and to deliver Services. For example, we must release your credit card information to a card-issuing bank to confirm payment for Services purchased on this Site; release your address information to the deliverer of any service or product that you ordered; and provide order information to third parties that help us provide customer service.
We will encourage our service partners to adopt and post privacy policies. However, the use of your Personally Identifiable Information by our service partners is governed by the privacy policies of those service partners, and is not subject to our control.
Occasionally we may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide Personally Identifiable Information to the appropriate governmental authorities. We will disclose Personally Identifiable Information upon receipt of a court order, subpoena, or to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation. We fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our services for illegal activities. We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful.
We may also provide Nonpersonally Identifiable Information about our customers' sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to third party advertisers, but these statistics do not include any Personally Identifiable Information.
