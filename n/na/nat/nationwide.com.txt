Thanks for choosing Nationwide. We know that protecting your privacy is important.  Our privacy statement explains how we collect, use, share, and protect your information. It's for Nationwide customers and visitors of nationwide.com. If we change our privacy policy, we’ll post the changes right here. This way you can always check back to learn what information we collect, how we use it, how we protect it, and when we might disclose it.
So just how do we protect your privacy? In a nutshell, we promise to treat your personal information responsibly and provide you with choices. It’s as simple as that. Here’s how.
Collecting, using, and sharing visitor information
Many of our online activities don’t require visitors to register for an account or give us any personal information. For example, visitors can use our financial planning guides without giving us any personal information, such as a name or address. We use Web tools to track how visitors use our Web site so we can improve your experience. Nationwide and our business partners use cookies, clear GIFs, and other tools to track visitor’s IP addresses, domain names, and browser information. These tools don’t collect a visitor’s personal information.
Cookies

We also use cookies to create a secure session with customers or visitors who want to enter or access their personal information. Just remember, some of our features may not work if you disable cookies.
Clear GIFs (Graphic Interchange Format)
A clear GIF is small file that tracks visitors so we can learn how they use Web ads and Web sites. These GIFs don’t have any personal information.  Some of our business partners use GIFs on Web sites and may use GIFs provided by DoubleClick. For more information about DoubleClick or to opt out of their GIF, go to  http://www.doubleclick.com/us/about_doubleclick/privacy/.

Sharing your personal information
We don’t sell your personal information.
When you buy a product, we may share your personal information with other Nationwide companies or one of our business partners to service your product. We also share your personal information with your agent, investment adviser, investment company, broker-dealer, or transfer agent affiliates. They use your personal information to manage your policy or account.
We share your personal information for everyday business purposes. Some examples include mailing your statements or processing transactions that you request. You cannot opt out of these.
**Sharing your personal information for marketing  **
We may share your personal information with other Nationwide Companies or our business partners. We share your personal information with these companies so we can tell you about other products that might interest you.
Sometimes we have a contract with your company or your organization that prohibits us from sharing your personal information with our other companies and business partners. In this case, we do not market new products to you, unless you contact us first and give us your consent.
We have joint-marketing agreements with our business partners.  This means that we have partnered with them to offer you a new product that might interest you.  They may use your personal information to market their products.  If you would like to learn more about opting out, please read the next section.
Opt out
You can ask us not to share your personal information with Nationwide Companies or our business partners to market new products to you.  Just remember, Nationwide offers many different types of products and services.  You may not want to opt out if you would like to learn about these products directly from one of our companies.  Please call us toll free at 1-866-280-1809 to opt out of this sharing.   If you have already opted out, you don’t need to opt out again.
Vermont Customers:  We won't share your information with Nationwide Companies or our business partners for marketing purposes without your consent.
Confidentiality and security
We use physical and technical safeguards to protect your personal information. We limit access to your personal information to those who need it to do their jobs. The law requires our business partners to use your personal information only for our purposes. They may not share it or use it in any other way. We comply with all data security laws.
Web links
Other companies or organizations may have links to their Web sites on our Web pages. We are not responsible for how they collect, use, disclose, or secure the personal information that you provide to them. Please read their privacy policy so you can learn how the new Web site uses your personal information.
Questions
If you are a Nationwide customer, you can ask us to give you a copy of your personal information. Please send a letter to the address below and get your signature notarized to prove your identity. This is for your protection. We don’t charge a fee for giving you a copy of your information now, but we may charge a small fee in the future.
You can call your Agent to change your personal information. We can’t update information that other companies provide to us. So, you'll need to contact the other company to correct your information. For example, if you want to update the information in your credit report, you'll have to contact the credit-reporting agency.
