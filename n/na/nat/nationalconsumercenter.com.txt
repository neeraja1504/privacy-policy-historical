We will use commercially reasonable efforts to limit use of the Information by these third parties as necessary for the purposes set forth above.
Behavioral Advertising: Behavioral advertising enables us and our third party marketing partners to deliver to users what is hoped to be more relevant information and/or offers for products or services. We and our third party marketing partners may use cookies, web beacons and other technological means to track user’s online behavior and to collect Information that enables the tailoring of targeted offers and advertisements. We may share this and other Information with our third party marketing partners, who may compensate us. We are not responsible for the Information they collect, for their use of this Information or for the privacy practices of other websites that are linked to our Websites.
Personal Health Information : Our surveys may ask health-related questions which we may share with our third party marketing partners who advertise health-related products and services on our Websites or who otherwise promote health-related products or services. We will use this health information only with your consent and for the purpose of displaying offers for health-related for products and services or to provide Information to these providers so they can contact you. You may always request modification or removal of your information by contacting us at privacy@rewardzoneusa.com.
SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION
We use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, or accidental loss or destruction of your Information. We currently do not encrypt Information that we store.  Given the nature of the Internet, your Information passes through entities that we are unable to control.  Therefore, we cannot guarantee that our security measures or those of third parties who access or transmit your Information will prevent your Information from being illegally accessed, stolen or altered.
OPTING-OUT
Users may opt-out from receiving future offers from us or from our third party marketing partners by following the Opt-Out instructions contained in the marketing communication or by clicking here.  You may also opt-out from future communications from a third party by contacting them directly.  A third party’s use of Information is subject to their privacy policy and we have no control or responsibility over their use.
Users may opt out from the collection of online viewing data for behavioral advertising purposes by companies who have elected to participate in one of the behavioral advertising opt-out mechanisms such as the Digital Adverting Alliance’s opt-out program located at http://www.aboutads.info/choices. As is the case with most websites, we have not elected to participate in any of these programs at this time or alter our behavior when a user to one of our Websites has activated the “do-not-track” setting on their browser (see, “Browser “Do Not Track” Signals”, described below).
ACCESS TO INFORMATION
All users who provide their Information to us may modify and correct their Information by contacting us here.
YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS
The California “Shine the Light” law permits users who are California residents to request information regarding our disclosure of their Information to third parties including the categories of Information shared and a list of the names and addresses of third parties with whom the Information was shared.  If you are a California resident and would like a copy of this notice, please submit a request by contacting us here.  In your request, please specify that you want "Your RewardzoneUSA LLC California Privacy Rights Notice."  Please allow 30 days for a response.
Browser “Do Not Track” Signals:   Most browsers contain a “do-not-track” setting.  In general, when a “do-not-track” setting is active, the user’s browser notifies other websites that the user does not want their personal information and online behavior to be tracked and used, for example, for behavioral advertising.  As required by recent Shine the Light law amendments we are required to inform you that, as is the case with most websites, we do not honor or alter our behavior when a user to one of our Websites has activated the “do-not-track” setting on his/her browser.
Changes to this privacy policy: We reserve the right to revise and update this Policy at any time. If we make material changes to this Policy, we will post notice on our Website. Any such revisions will be effective 30 days after posting to the Website, and will apply to all Information collected by us both before and following the effective date. Your use of a Website or entrance into any sweepstakes or other promotion following any such revisions will be deemed your acceptance of such revisions. Users should periodically visit this page to review our current policies on our collection and use of Information.
Questions, Suggestions or to Contact Us:   If you have any questions, comments, complaints, or suggestions regarding our Privacy Policy or our website, please contact us here.
