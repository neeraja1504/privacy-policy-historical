The User also consents to having the Homepage accessible and available to all. We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy statement. We do not sell your personal information to third parties.
1. INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT
We collect information on Users in order to facilitate the operation of the nabbesh Platform.
The User consents and knowingly chooses to disclose all information that is uploaded to the nabbesh Platform in the form of a Homepage. When you add to your Homepage with further information about yourself, you agree that any registration information you give to nabbesh will always be accurate, correct and up to date.
The nabbesh Search Facility is available to all Users. Users are also invited to enter personal information which provides an enhanced set of search results.
When you sign up for a nabbesh Account (or 'Homepage') or other nabbesh services or promotions that require registration, we ask you for personal information such as name and email address. After you have created your Homepage we provide you with the option to add additional personal information such as phone number. We may combine the information that you submit under your Homepage with information from other nabbesh, in order to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our services or to suggest to you people you might know, or other people who may have skills or hobbies of interest to you. For certain information, we give you the opportunity to opt out of combining such information within your account settings page.
nabbesh provides an invitation service when you register with the Platform. If you choose (consent or opt in) to use our invitation service to tell a contact about our site, we will ask you for information needed to send the invitation, such as your contact's email address or we will ask you to consent to having your contact list(s) imported. We will send your contacts an email in your name inviting him or her to visit the site, and we will send additional reminders. nabbesh stores this information to send invitations and reminders, to register a contact connection if your invitation is accepted, to allow you to see invitations you have sent and to track the success of our referral program. All information that you enter or upload about your contacts will be covered by the same terms of this privacy policy as cover your own information. nabbesh also stores this information (imported contacts information) to avoid duplication of contacts and to check when contacts, not invited by the User, join the nabbesh Platform through registration. nabbesh will also store the User's access details in order to synch the contacts whenever the User logs in.

Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. We use this information to gauge the level of user satisfaction with the site. We use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys. That company is prohibited from using our users' personally identifiable information for any other purpose. We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.
2. USE OF INFORMATION OBTAINED BY NABBESH

nabbesh may use information in your Homepage without identifying you as an individual to third parties. We do this for purposes such as aggregating how many people are in a network like a group of electricians, and also personalizing advertisements and promotions so that we can provide you with up to date nabbesh promotions and sponsors of community groupings. We believe this benefits you. Where such information is used, we generally allow you to specify in your User Account Settings that you do not want this to be done or to take other actions that limit the connection of this information to your Homepage (e.g. removing photo tag links).
3. CHILDREN AGED UNDER 12H
