National Australia Bank privacy policy - NAB
General information
The types of information that we collect and hold about you could include:
identification information such as your name, postal or email address, telephone numbers, and date of birth;
other contact details such as social media handles;
financial details such as your tax file number;
health and biometric information (e.g. fingerprints, voice patterns) where permitted;
information about how you interact with us when you use internet or mobile banking (such as information about how you use your devices);
device information, such as which browser you use and your operating system language;
your location or activity including IP address and geolocation data based on the GPS of your mobile device (when accessing our services), and whether you’ve accessed third party sites;
credit information such as details relating to credit history, credit capacity, and eligibility for credit (‘credit worthiness’); and
other information we think is necessary.
Over the course of our relationship with you, we may collect and hold additional personal information about you, including transactional information, account or policy information, complaint or enquiries about your product or service.
If you have general enquiry type questions, you can choose to do this anonymously or use a pseudonym. We might not always be able to interact with you this way however as we are often governed by strict regulations that require us to know who we’re dealing with.
Credit Information
When we’re checking your credit worthiness and at other times, we might collect information about you from and give it to credit reporting bodies. This information can include:
ID information : a record of your name(s) (including an alias or previous name), date of birth, gender, current or last known address and previous two addresses, name of current or last known employer and drivers licence number.
Information request : a record of a lender asking a credit reporting body for information in relation to a credit application, including the type and amount of credit applied for.
Default information : a record of your consumer credit payments being overdue.
Serious credit infringement : a record of when a lender reasonably believes that there has been a fraud relating to your consumer credit or that you have avoided paying your consumer credit payments and the credit provider can’t find you.
Personal insolvency information: a record relating to your bankruptcy or your entry into a debt agreement or personal insolvency agreement.
Court proceedings information: an Australian court judgment relating to your credit.
Publicly available information: a record relating to your activities in Australia and your credit worthiness.
Consumer credit liability information : certain details relating to your consumer credit, such as the name of the credit provider, whether the credit provider has an Australian Credit Licence, the type of consumer credit, the day on which the consumer credit was entered into and terminated, the maximum amount of credit available and certain repayment terms and conditions.
Repayment history information: a record of whether or not you’ve made monthly consumer credit payments and when they were paid.
Payment information: If a lender gave a credit reporting body default information about you and the overdue amount is paid, a statement that the payment has been made.
New arrangement information: If a lender gave a credit reporting body default information about you and your consumer credit contract is varied or replaced, a statement about this.
We base some things on the information we get from credit reporting bodies, such as:
our summaries of what the credit reporting bodies tell us; and
credit scores: a credit score is a calculation that lets us know how likely a credit applicant will repay credit we may make available to them.
Information that we get from a credit reporting body or information we derive from such information is known as credit eligibility information.
What sensitive information do we collect?
Sometimes we need to collect sensitive information 1 about you. This could include information about your health or reasons relating to hardship. Unless required by law, we will only collect sensitive information with your consent.
When the law authorises or requires us to collect information
We may collect information about you because we are required or authorised by law to collect it. There are laws that affect financial institutions, including company and tax law, which require us to collect personal information. For example, we require personal information to verify your identity under Commonwealth Anti-Money Laundering law.
What do we collect via your website activity?
When you use NAB Group websites or mobile applications we may collect information about your location or activity including IP address, telephone number and whether you’ve accessed a third party site. If you use internet banking or our websites, we monitor your use of those online interactions. This is done to ensure we can verify you and you can receive information from us, to identify ways we can improve our services for you and to understand you better. Some of this website or application information is collected using cookies. For more information on how we use cookies and tracking tags see our Cookies Policy www.nab.com.au/cookies.
If you start but don’t submit an online form we can contact you using any of the contact details you’ve supplied or other contact details we have for you to offer help (unless the use is anonymous).
We also know that some customers like to engage with us through social media channels. We may collect information about you when you interact with us through these channels. For all confidential matters, please interact with us via private messaging or secure channels.
Much of this data collection is done through the use of cookies and used to improve our services and enhance users online experience with us (e.g. website statistics), and does not identify individual customers but does identify internet browser. Where we do identify you (such as where customers are logged onto our online services), NAB Group treats any use or disclosure in accordance with this policy.
