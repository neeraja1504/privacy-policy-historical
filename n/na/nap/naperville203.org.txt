District Electronic Communications Guidelines
District 203 Acceptable Use Guidelines for Electronic Communications
District 203 employees/volunteers have been utilizing technology for many years in delivering upon our mission to educate students to be self-directed learners, collaborative workers, complex thinkers, quality producers, and community contributors. In addition to their educational pursuits, today’s students, and those in future years, are and will be deeply engaged in electronic forms of communications and associated technologies for daily interaction with friends, family, community and larger social networks.
Many District employees/volunteers have also utilized technologies such as email, websites, blogs, text messaging and use of social media websites such as Facebook, Twitter, and more, to communicate with similar groups for personal interactions. These forms of communication are dynamic, mobile, and quickly reach their targeted audience through technologies that have become an integral part of many individuals’ lives.
As these technologies continue to advance at a rapid pace, they can become sources of significant benefit to the educational process when integrated into District 203's scholastic delivery model. While continual evolution will undoubtedly occur in this area, it is our goal in issuing these guidelines to increase awareness and understanding of these technologies as well as ensure that their use for District business meets the public and professional standards for communicating with students that we set for ourselves in District 203.
These guidelines are designed for the purpose of:
Clarifying acceptable ways to use electronic communication tools when communicating with students, peers, and community members for District related business.
Raising awareness of the positive and negative outcomes that may result in using these tools when interacting with the targeted audience.
Establishing the appropriate levels of approval for the use and integration of these technologies for educational benefits aligned with our District mission.
This document includes a visual matrix that uses color coding to help clarify the District's position related to various forms of electronic communication. In the visual matrix individuals or groups are categorized into either communication originators or communication receivers (also referred to as the targeted audience) to help with interpretation of the guidelines.
