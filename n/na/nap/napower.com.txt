To that end, we may report information about your account(s) to credit bureaus and/or consumer reporting agencies.
Please note that we will release your Personal or Payment Information if required to do so by law, search warrant, subpoena, court order or other legal process.

We may also disclose your Personal or Payment Information if you or your legal representative authorizes us to do so, or if it is necessary to perform credit checks or collect or report debts owed to us.
NA Power reserves the right to transfer any Personal or Payment Information in the event we transfer all or a portion of our business or assets, such as bankruptcy, dissolution, merger or acquisition. If such a transfer should occur, the privacy policy of another company may supplant our Policy. However, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to try to require that the transferee use Personal or Payment Information in a manner that is consistent with our Policy.
How We Safeguard Your Personal Information
The security of your personal information is very important to us. We have put in place reasonable physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect, including, without limitation, any Social Security numbers we may receive. We use industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring, receiving and displaying Personal and Payment Information on our website. Only those employees and service providers who need access to your Social Security number in order to perform their duties are authorized to have access to such information. However, we cannot guarantee that all communications between us or information stored on our servers will be free from unauthorized access by third parties such as hackers, and your use of our website, products and services demonstrates your assumption of this risk.
Certain states where we operate have specific requirements regarding the disclosure and protection of certain customer personal information; for example, we comply with Connecticut's (C.G.S. 42-470 et. seq.) and Massachusetts' (201 CMR 17.00; M.G.L. c. 93H) applicable rules.
