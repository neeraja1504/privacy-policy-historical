For more details on security see section 7 below.
As part of Our responsibilities as a Designated National Agency, performing services
related to international qualifications and skills recognition on behalf of the UK
Government, it is necessary for Us to maintain an archive of qualification certificates
and transcripts for checking and training purposes, and as an important aid in the
prevention of education fraud. Therefore We may choose to retain electronic copies of
your qualifications and transcripts as part of this archive. If you do not wish your
3
V18.9.1
qualification documents to be used in this way, please tell Us; by email at
dpo@ecctis.co.uk; by telephone on +44 3003 038777; or by post at 68-70 Suffolk
Road, Cheltenham, GL50 2ED, United Kingdom.
6.2 Our use of your personal data will always have a lawful basis; this may be contract,
because it is necessary to process your data for Our performance of a contract with
you; or consent, because you have consented to Our use of your personal data (e.g.
by consenting to marketing emails); or legitimate interest, because processing your
data is in the legitimate interests of Ecctis Ltd and/or its operational entities (e.g. by
archiving international qualification certificates as a reference source for the purposes
of checking, training, and fraud prevention).
Specifically, We may use your data for the following purposes:
6.2.1    supplying Our products and services to you (note that We require your
personal data in order to enter into a contract with you, and We cannot supply
Our services without processing your personal data);
6.2.2    personalising and tailoring Our products and services for you;
6.2.3    responding to emails/messages from you;
6.2.4    sending you emails from time to time, with relevant information, and feedback
surveys about Our service to you, and research surveys finding out about your
experiences of applying for study or work in the UK and your perceptions of
the UK – you can opt out of receiving these emails by entering your email
address here or by unsubscribing using the links provided in Our emails.
6.2.5    For Our organisational members and individual users of Our services for
organisations, the above also applies.
6.3 The lawful bases that We use to process personal data are:
Contract – for performing qualification and skills evaluation and statement services for
individuals; or for performing services for organisations or individual users of Our
services for organisations;
Consent – for communications with you which have direct marketing purposes (this is
for informing you about Our related services that may be of interest to you; We do not
spam you and We do not sell your data to other organisations);
Legitimate interest – for retaining copies of qualification certificates and transcripts
as a reference source for the purposes of checking and training and for prevention of
education fraud; and for communicating with you to give you relevant information or to
survey you – about your customer experience with Us or to research your experiences
of applying for study or work in the UK and your perceptions of the UK.
6.4 Data will be retained for the following periods:
6.4.1    Personal data used for the provision of qualification and skills evaluation and
statement services for individuals will be retained for a period of 25 years after
the completion of the service to the individual. For the purposes of the
prevention of fraud, UK NARIC is sometimes requested to verify statements
4
V18.9.1
that it has issued. To enable cross-checking and verification to take place, it is
necessary to retain personal data in Our systems for a period of time.
Many individuals using Our services do so to enter UK study or work and in
order to find out more about your experiences of this as you go through
courses of study or employment, We may from time to time send you
research surveys during this period. Your personal data will be deleted after
the period of time stated above. If you wish your personal data to be deleted
before the expiry of this time period, you can request this by emailing
dpo@ecctis.co.uk or using the contact details in Section 13. Note that if you
do this, We will be unable to verify your UK NARIC statements if asked to do
so by educational institutions, employers, government authorities or other
agencies.
6.4.2    Electronic copies of qualification certificates, transcripts, and related
qualification documents submitted with applications, will be deleted from Our
application database 12 months after the completion of the service to the
individual and Our last communication with you. Passport biographical data
and/or National ID card data for services requiring Primary Source Verification
will be deleted as soon as PSV processing has been completed.
However, We may choose to retain electronic copies of your qualification
certificates and transcripts as part of an archive of qualification documents for
checking and training purposes, and as an important aid in the prevention of
education fraud. In these cases, the certificates will be retained in a secure
section of Our server, for the duration for which the certificates are required. If
you do not wish your qualification documents to be used in this way, please
tell Us; by email at dpo@ecctis.co.uk; or by using the contact details in
Section 13.
6.4.3    Personal data provided to Us by Our member organisations for evaluation
purposes, e.g. qualification documents bearing names submitted as part of a
member enquiry, will be retained for a period of 5 years. This will assist
organisations in demonstrating compliance with Government, regulatory and
best practice requirements.
6.4.4    Personal data which may be provided to Us by telephone may be recorded by
Our system. This data will be retained for a period of 6 months.
6.4.5    For Our organisational member services, personal data relating to system
users, maintained by members themselves, will be retained for a period of 6
months after the user is deactivated.
6.4.6    For Our organisational members, and individual users of Our services for
organisations who are using Our training services or who are attending Our
training/events/conferences, We will retain data relating to training and
development activities undertaken and events/conferences attended for a
period of 3 years. This will assist in maintaining Records of Personal
Development.
6.5 You have the right at any time to request that We stop using your personal data, and
to request that We delete it. Note that if you do this before We have completed a
service to you, We will be unable to complete that service for you; and that We will be
unable to communicate with you after your personal data is deleted.
5
V18.9.1
6.6   If unsolicited personal or sensitive personal data is sent to Us, in any form, We will not
retain the data and We will delete it.
7. How and where do We store your data?
7.1   For Our qualification comparison and statement services for individuals (excluding
services involving Primary Source Verification) your data will be stored in the UK in
Our secure internal IT systems, in Our secure on-site servers and in Our secure back-
up servers and web servers.
7.2   For Our qualification comparison and statement services for individuals which require
Primary Source Verification, and only for these individual services, We need to share
your data with companies and organisations specialising in verification services. As
qualification verification has to deal with different kinds of institutions worldwide, We
use a range of selected companies and organisations in different parts of the world.
Some of these companies and organisations will process your data outside of the
European Economic Area (EEA) and therefore outside the usual jurisdiction of the
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). You will be asked to give specific
consent for this at the time of ordering services requiring Primary Source Verification,
and provided with details of the specific companies and organisations. All such
arrangements with verification companies and organisations are governed by
appropriate agreements and contracts.
7.3   Data security is very important to us, and to protect your data we have taken suitable
measures to safeguard and secure personal data collected through our site.
7.4   The measures We take to secure and protect your data include:
7.4.1    Personal data is stored within a secure network, protected by the latest anti-
virus, malware and intrusion prevention security software;
7.4.2    Ecctis Ltd staff are trained in handling and processing personal data in a
secure and sensitive manner.
8. Do We share your data?
8.1   We will not share your data with other companies/organisations unless you give Us
explicit consent.
8.2   For Our qualification comparison and statement services for individuals which require
Primary Source Verification, and only for these individual services, We need to share
your data with companies and organisations specialising in verification services. As
qualification verification has to deal with different kinds of institutions worldwide, We
use a range of selected companies and organisations in different parts of the world.
Some of these companies and organisations will process your data outside of the
European Economic Area (EEA) and therefore outside the usual jurisdiction of the
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). You will be asked to give specific
consent for this at the time of ordering services requiring Primary Source Verification.
All such arrangements with verification companies and organisations are governed by
appropriate agreements and contracts.
8.3   When payments are made through Our Site, your payment details will be directly
entered into Worldpay’s secure payment portal. Your payment details are not stored in
6
V18.9.1
Our systems. Worldpay is a UK-based company.
8.4      We may record and compile statistics about the use of Our Site including data on
traffic, usage patterns, user numbers, sales, and other information. All such data will
be anonymised when compiled and will not include any personally identifying data, or
any anonymised data that can be combined with other data to identify you. We may
from time to time share such anonymised statistical data with third parties, including
HM Government for the purposes of Our reporting and accountability. Data will be
shared and used in this way within the bounds of the law.
8.5      In certain circumstances, We may be legally required to share certain data held by Us,
which may include your personal data, for example, where We are involved in legal
proceedings, or where We are complying with legal requirements, a court order, or the
orders of a governmental authority.
What happens if Our business changes hands?
9.1      We may, from time to time, expand or reduce Our business and this may involve the
sale and/or the transfer of control of all or part of Our business. Any personal data that
you have provided will, where it is relevant to any part of Our business that is being
transferred, be transferred along with that part and the new owner or newly controlling
party will, under the terms of this privacy policy, be permitted to use that data only for
the same purposes for which it was originally collected by Us.
How can you control your data?
10.1     In addition to your rights under the GDPR, set out in section 4, when you submit
personal data via Our Site, you may be given options to restrict Our use of your data.
In particular, we aim to give you control on Our use of your data for direct marketing
purposes and there is a separate opt-in for these purposes. You also have the ability
to opt-out of receiving informational, survey and other emails from Us, by
unsubscribing using the links provided in Our emails.
10.2     You may also wish to sign up to one or more of the preference services operating in
the UK: the Telephone Preference Service (TPS), the Corporate Telephone
Preference Service (CTPS), and the Mailing Preference Service (MPS). These may
help to prevent you receiving unsolicited marketing. Note, however, that these
services will not prevent you from receiving marketing communications you have
consented to receiving.
Your right to withhold information
You may access certain areas of Our Site without providing any data at all. However, to use all
features and functions available on Our Site you may be required to submit or allow for the
collection of certain data.
How can you access your data?
You have the right to ask for a copy of any of your personal data held by Us (where such data
is held). No fee is payable. Contact Us for more details at dpo@ecctis.co.uk or use the contact
details below in section 13.
