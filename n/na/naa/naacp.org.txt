Links to other sites:
The site contains links to various other private organizations. Once you link to another website, you are then subject to the privacy policies of the new website. We cannot control nor are we responsible for any such third party collection or use of your personal information. It is always a good idea to read the Privacy Policy of any website you visit.
Children:
The Site is a general audience site which is neither designed nor intended to collect personal information from children who are under the age of 13. In order to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, children under the age of 13 should not provide any personal information to the Site.
Security:
We use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that any information you give to us is stored and maintained in secure servers and not publicly accessible.  The NAACP protects personal data by only allowing limited, authorized personnel to have access to such personal data.  The NAACP maintains an encrypted firewall to protect such personal data. The NAACP’s software provider has level one payment card industry compliance to ensure that online credit transactions are secure.   The NAACP has technical safeguards such as “firewalls, virus and intrusion detection, and authentication protocols.” However, despite our best security efforts, no data transmission or storage can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
