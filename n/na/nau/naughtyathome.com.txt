We are totally committed to protecting your privacy and security. The following information is designed to help you understand how we collect, use, disseminate and safeguard the information you provide to us while accessing and using our Site. By accessing and using our Site, you signify your assent to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with our information practices, please do not access or use our Site. As provided below, we reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, add or remove portions of this policy at any time by posting such changes to this page. Such changes will be effective upon posting. The Site requests that you read this Privacy Policy carefully and consult it regularly.
Information Collection and Use
A. Information Collection. When users order our services, the payment processor collects information such as names, billing addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, and credit card numbers. We collect information from our users when the user signs on to our Birth Date Verifier™ script, enters account information, uses our payment processing page, and uses/orders/purchases our services. Information is collected through completion of on-line forms on the join page and in the online store and sent to our payment processor for credit card verification. If a user refuses to provide the required information for a specific service, the user will not be able to utilize that service.
B. Information Use. We use information for the following purposes: to fulfill your requests for services, to process credit card payments, to answer billing questions, to reset user names, and to contact you. We reserve the right to use your information for market research data purposes to increase the user’s experience according to personal interests and to formulate statistical models to accomplish the Site’s goals through surveys or contests. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others.
Registration and Order Forms
To use, purchase, or order services on our Site, a user must complete an on-line form. The form requires a user to provide us (and our payment processor) with certain contact information (including, but not limited to, your name, mailing address, telephone number, and e-mail address) and certain financial information (including your credit card number and the expiration date for your credit card). This information is used to purchase services, verify credit card details, validate credit identity, and/or manage the user’s account. If we have trouble processing an order or otherwise need to contact a user, the contact information is used to get in touch with the user. From time to time, we may also ask that you provide us with additional information so that we can better tailor our services to meet your needs.
