using an automated process to access the Site for the purposes of gathering the private information of other users; or

While we reserve the right to take down any content that violates these standards, we do not assume a duty or responsibility to do so.
5. Protecting Third Party Rights
We reserve the right to
take down any profile that we believe is false or contains false information;
take down any Content that we believe infringes upon the intellectual property rights of a third party, including but not limited to copyright, trademark, patent, trade secrets, rights of publicity, or any other intellectual property right; or
take down any Content that we believe otherwise violates these Terms.
We do not assume a duty or responsibility to review Content to ensure that it does not violate the standards of this section. That said, we have a policy through which third parties can ask us to take down Content that infringes upon their intellectual property rights, which appears in Section 6 (below). When we receive take down requests, we will try to address or resolve the request or complaint within 72 hours.
6. Procedure for Reporting Infringing and False Content
Any requests to take down Content that is false or that infringes upon your intellectual property rights should be sent to abuse@vfiles.com. Any such complaints or requests should include your name, your mailing address, your telephone number and your e-mail address.

Next Steps
Once we receive a complaint, we will make best efforts to review the complaint as soon as possible. If you have provided us all of the information above, we will promptly remove or block access to the Content or the fake profile, and will send a notice to the other VFiles user indicating that we have done so. We will terminate the accounts of any repeat infringers at our discretion.
Counter Notice
If we send you a notice that we’ve removed your Content from the Site because it is fake or because it infringes upon another party’s intellectual property rights, and you believe that we acted as a result of misidentification or error, you can lodge a Counter Notice by e-mailing us at abuse@vfiles.com. Any Counter Notice should include (a) your name, address, telephone number and e-mail address, (b) an identification of the material that we took down, (c) a statement that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed as a result of mistake or misidentification, (d) a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the U.S. District Court for the federal district in which you reside, and that you will accept service of process from the complaining party or its agent in the event that a law suit is filed against you relating to such Content, and (e) your physical or electronic signature.
If we receive such a Counter Notice, we will put the removed Content back on your profile, unless we first receive notice from the complaining party that it has filed a law suit or other action seeking a court order to keep you from engaging in the allegedly infringing activity.
7. Conflicts Among Users
In the event that you and another Site user have a conflict based on either of your conduct or uploaded Content, we reserve the right to take any appropriate measures to resolve the conflict, including but in no way limited to taking down any Content that violates these Terms of Use (pursuant to Section 6, above) or terminating your account (pursuant to Section 8, below). We do not, however, assume a duty or responsibility to intervene in such conflicts.
8. Termination

This could result in a deletion of your account and any and all Content uploaded to your profile.
You may delete your profile or account at any time.

This Privacy Policy is designed to inform you of the various types of information that we collect from you when you use the VFiles.com web site (the “Site”). By using the Site, you acknowledge and agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.
We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time by updating the information posted to the website. We’ll let you know when we make changes to our Privacy Policy by posting a “last modified” date at the top of this page.

The Information We Collect and How We Use It
When you visit the Site, you provide us with two types of information:/ personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information.
Personally Identifiable Information
If you create a user profile with us, we’ll ask you to provide basic information about yourself that could be used to identify you, such as your name, your e-mail address, your telephone number, your address, and/or a photograph of yourself (together, “Profile Information”). We also collect and store information you place on your user profile (e.g. information about your favorite designers, your personal style) and information contained in messages you send to other VFiles.com users. If you connect to VFiles.com through a third-party social networking website like Facebook or Twitter, we may also use personal information from those profiles. In this Privacy Policy, we refer to all of the above information as “Personal Information.”
With respect to Profile Information, we will display Profile Information to other VFiles.com users in order to allow you to connect with other VFiles.com users. Of course, you can choose your own privacy settings, which can restrict the amount of Profile Information that can be seen or accessed by other VFiles.com users. If you have any questions about how to change your privacy settings, drop us a note at support@vfiles.com.
We use Personal Information to customize your experience within the Site. For example, we use Personal Information to provide you with recommendations for specific Content available on the Site, to allow you to easily return to posts and messages made by you or other Site users, and to return to searches that you’ve conducted within the Site. We will never intentionally share your personally identifiable information with any third party without first obtaining your permission to do so.
On occasion, we may also use your Personal Information to contact you with our newsletters, marketing or promotional materials, or other information that we think would be of interest to you. You can tell us to stop sending these kinds of communications to you at any time, either by updating your “preferences” information in your account settings, or by following the “unsubscribe” instructions provided in any of the communications we send you.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information
When you enter the Site, we automatically collect information about your browser type and your Internet Protocol (IP) address(es), as well as information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website (for example, websites you might have visited before you visited the Site, the amount of time you spend on those sites). We also collect information that you provide to us when you sign up to use the Site that cannot reasonably be used to identify or contact you – such information includes information about the various demographic groups you fall into (e.g. age group, income group, etc.), as well as information relating to your use of the Site (e.g. the types of Content you search for on the Site, the times of day you access the Site, etc.). In this Privacy Policy, we refer to all of the above as “Non-Personally Identifiable Information.”
We use Non-Personally Identifiable Information in the aggregate to monitor the web site, to improve the web site’s offerings, to customize your experience with the Site, and for targeted advertising. Advertising is conducted by third parties, who will have access to your IP address when their ads are displayed on the page you are viewing. These third parties have no access to your personally identifiable information unless you’ve chosen to share it with them.
Privacy Policy Cookies
We use “cookies,” which are small text files that are stored on your computer that retain your information and preferences relative to your activities on the website. They are meant to enhance your experience on the Site, and are used primarily to recognize registered users who are logged on. For example, if you tell us to, we will send a cookie to your machine that remembers your login credentials to the Site, so you don’t have to enter them every time you access the Site.
Should you wish to prevent your computer from accepting cookies from the Site, you can change the settings on your web browser to either block cookies sent from the web site, or to disable cookies altogether. Please note that the Site may not function properly, or may function differently, if you choose not to receive cookies.
Other Permitted Uses of Your Information
We have the right to provide your information to third parties such as web hosting companies to the extent it is necessary to keep the Site up and operating. We have the right to disclose and transfer user lists and related personally identifiable information in connection with any merger, sale or contemplated sale of all or part of our business related to the web site, and to treat such information as a business asset in the event of bankruptcy or liquidation. We may also disclose personally identifiable information to a third party if disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, court order, and/or other legal instrument, legal proceeding or relevant law, or if there is an immediate, imminent threat to the safety of any person, VFiles or the Site.
Editing Information
You may edit or delete any information provided to us at any time by editing your user profile. To delete your account entirely, please e-mail contact@vfiles.com.
Privacy
In order to protect your information, we use industry-standard security methods such as firewalls, encryption security layers and secured socket layers. We also permit you to create your own privacy settings, in order to control the specific information that is available to other users of the Site. However, no security measures are perfect, and we therefore cannot guarantee that the steps we have taken to secure your information will prevent our systems from being compromised and/or your information from being disclosed.
With respect to information you choose to share on the Site, you essentially control your own destiny. You can change the Privacy Settings for your profile so that certain information that you share is not accessible by the general public or by other users. However, keep in mind that the Privacy Settings cannot be used to keep everything private – by way of example, if you comment upon VFiles Content (as defined in the Terms of Use), those comments will be accessible to any registered user of the Site. Moreover, even if you delete content that you post on the Site, other users may have already downloaded or otherwise kept that content, and the content could potentially be accessible through archived pages of the Site. It’s very important that you think carefully before you post any private information to the Site. If you have any questions about how to keep your information private on the Site, please e-mail us at support@vfiles.com, and we’ll do our best to help.
Links
We may contain links to websites that are not affiliated with VFiles, and whose data security and privacy policies may differ from this Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for the privacy policies employed by third party sites. We encourage you to review the privacy statements of any site that is accessed from the site so that you will be aware of how each visited site collects, uses and distributes information.
Children Under the Age of 13
VFiles.com is designed solely for users over the age of 13. We do not knowingly solicit or collect any information about users who may be under the age of 13, and will delete any information provided by such individuals as soon as possible. Please do not provide us with any personal information if you are under the age of 13.
We do allow users between the ages of 13 and 18 to use the site. However, such users should discuss the use of VFiles.com or any other social networking site with their parents before they submit, share or post any content to the Site.
