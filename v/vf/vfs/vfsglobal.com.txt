VFS Global
What type of information is collected from you?
We only collect the information that is required by the client government in order to submit the visa application or provide a requested service. The personal information that we collect is determined by the government that grants the visa, and is dependent on what type of visa you are applying for.
Some examples of the types of data that may be collected:
Personal data: Such as, name, national identity number, nationality, gender, details of your travel document (e.g. passport or ID), email address, telephone number and postal address, place & date of birth.
Sensitive Personal data: Religion, marital status, health related information, Biometric data, such as Fingerprints, Photographs & DNA swabs.
Third persons: Children, parents name, spouse name, employers’ details, someone who gives a personal reference, address you are staying at your destination.
Communication data: Contact details, emails, mobile phone number.
Payments data: Payment card details, bank account details.
Electronic media data: CCTV images, video & audio recordings, website cookies (see below).
This list is not exhaustive and varies depending on the client government’s requirements and the services you request from us.
If you want to know exactly what personal information will be collected for your visa or travel document application, please contact our Data Protection Officer or contact the diplomatic mission concerned at the address above.
Third Parties for legal reasons
We will share personal information when we believe it is required, such as:
To comply with legal obligations and respond to requests from government agencies, including law enforcement and other public authorities, which may include such authorities outside your country of residence.
In the event of a merger, sale, restructure, acquisition, joint venture, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets, or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings)
To protect our rights, users, systems, and Services.
Transferring your information off-shore
As part of the services offered to you through this website, or in a Visa Application Centre, the information which you provide to us will, in most circumstances, be transferred to off-shore countries. This is because by applying for a visa or other type of travel document your personal information will be sent via the diplomatic mission to the country you are applying to visit. These countries may not have similar information protection laws to your country or the EU. As part of the visa application process we will seek your consent to transfer your personal information “off-shore” even though it is a necessary part of the application process we are obliged by law to ask your permission to transfer your personal information.
We may transfer your personal information, internally within VFS Global, to one of our data centres in the UK, Canada, Germany, India or Russia depending on which country you are in and applying to travel to. If we transfer personal information internally within VFS Global from one country to another country, where the data protection laws may not offer the same level of data privacy protection as in your home country, we take measures to provide an appropriate level of data privacy protection. In other words, your rights and protections remain with your data. For example, we use European Commission approved contractual clauses, and other measures designed to ensure that the recipients of your personal information protect it.
If you would like to know more about our data transfer practices, please contact our Data Protection Officer.
How you can access and update your information?
You have the right to ask for a copy of the information VFS Global holds about you. If you request access to your personal information, we will gladly comply, subject to any relevant legal requirements and exemptions, including identity verification procedures. Before providing data to you, we will ask for proof of identity and sufficient information about your interaction with us so that we can locate any relevant data. We may also charge you a fee for providing you with a copy of your data (except where this is not permissible under local law).
The accuracy of your information is important to us. In some jurisdictions, you have the right to correct or amend your personal information if it is inaccurate or requires updating. You may also have the right to request deletion of your personal information; however, this is not always possible due to legal requirements and other obligations and factors.
If you want a copy of the information we hold about you, or if you change email address, or any of the other information we hold is inaccurate or out of date, please submit a personal data request, write to us at our local office shown at the beginning of this privacy notice, or email our Data Protection Officer.
