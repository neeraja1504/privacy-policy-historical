What type of information is collected from you?
We only collect the information that is required by the client government in order to submit the visa application or provide a requested service.

We are legally required to hold some types of information to fulfil our statutory obligations (for example; Taxation legislation). We will hold your personal information on our systems only for as long as is necessary for the relevant activity as mandated by our client government, or as long as is set out in any relevant contract you hold with us.

Third Party Service Providers working on our behalf:
We may pass your information to our third-party service providers, agents subcontractors and other associated organisations for the purposes of completing tasks and providing services to you on our behalf (for example to process payments or deliver your visa to you by courier). However, when we use third party service providers, we disclose only the personal information that is necessary to deliver the service and we have a contract in place that requires them to keep your information secure and not to use it for their own direct marketing purposes.

The relevant third-party provider will use your details to process your payments and carry out their obligations arising from any applicable laws. In some cases, they will be acting as a Data Controller of your information and therefore we advise you to read their Privacy Notice.

These countries may not have similar information protection laws to your country.
We may transfer your personal information to one of our data centres in the UK, Canada, Germany, India or Russia depending on which country you are applying to travel to.

Security precautions in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of your information.
When you give us personal information, we take steps to ensure that it’s treated securely. Any sensitive information (such as credit or debit card details) is encrypted and protected. On our websites when you are on a secure page, a lock icon will appear on the in the address bar of most web browsers.
Non-sensitive details (your email address etc.) are transmitted normally over the Internet, and this can never be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your information, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. The password you have chosen when setting up your account, say for example when you book an appoint at a Visa application centre, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone.
Profiling.
Profiling is any form of automated processing of personal information in order to analyse or predict behaviour. We don’t do that.
