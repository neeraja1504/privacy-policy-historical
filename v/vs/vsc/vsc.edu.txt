Web Privacy Statement - Vermont State Colleges System
The Vermont State Colleges (VSC) are committed to preserving and maintaining the privacy of visitors to VSCS websites. The following discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for the VSCS (https://www.vsc.edu/) websites. By visiting any of the VSCS websites, you are accepting the practices described in this statement.
Information Gathering
We use your Internet domain and the Internet address of the computer you are using, the type of browser and operating system you are using, and the date and time of access to help diagnose problems with our servers and to administer our websites. We identify which parts of our sites are most heavily used, and which portion of our audience comes from within and outside of the VSCS network. We do not link your computer Internet address to anything personally identifiable. This means that user sessions may be tracked, but the users will remain anonymous.
Some of the Vermont State Colleges use Google Analytics to monitor traffic on websites. Google Analytics places “cookies,” or text files, on your computer to help us analyze how visitors use our site so we can improve its usefulness. Personal information is not stored with cookies. You can set the preferences on your browser to refuse cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being set.
Other information is collected only if you choose to send it. For example you may complete an online form, make an online purchase, or send an email.
Use of Information
As noted above, the VSCS uses the information we collect to tailor site content to user needs, to generate aggregate statistical reports, to help diagnose problems and otherwise to administer our websites. At no time do we disclose site usage by individual computer Internet address.
Information you choose to send on our sites is used to complete transactions (such as registering for a course or sending an email).
The VSCS may employ independent contractors to help manage web-based services, and such contractors may have access to data similar to the access we give our employees. In such instances, we take precautions to protect against re-disclosure of personal information.
Security
This site has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of the information under our control.
