Privacy
It is our sincere hope at Volkswagen of America, Inc. (“Volkswagen”) that what is now a purely digital relationship will evolve into a more personal one. Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this Privacy Policy, which explains our information practices across all of Volkswagen’s websites and digital properties, including mobile versions of our site and mobile applications (each a “Volkswagen Property” and collectively, the “Volkswagen Properties”). Your use of any Volkswagen Property constitutes your agreement to the terms of this Privacy Policy.
The Information We Collect
When you visit the Volkswagen Properties, we may collect certain personally identifiable information you choose to disclose to us, such as your name, postal address, telephone number, date of birth, and email address. We may also collect user generated content you choose to publish on the Volkswagen Properties.
You may use your Facebook account credentials to sign in to certain Volkswagen Properties. If you connect using your Facebook credentials, you authorize us to collect your authentication information, such as your username, access credentials, and other information that may be available on or through your Facebook account, including your name, country, email address, and date of birth.
The Volkswagen Properties also may passively collect non-personal and aggregated information that is automatically sent to us by your web browser or device, including your Internet Service Provider and IP address, the date and time you access the Volkswagen Property, the pages you have accessed while visiting the Volkswagen Property, and the Internet address from which you accessed the Volkswagen Property.
We may receive information from third party sources, such as authorized Volkswagen dealerships, and incorporate it with your personal information.
How We Use and Share Information
We may use your personal information in a number of ways, such as to send promotional emails to you, to enter you into contests and sweepstakes, to participate in our online communities, to conduct surveys and market research, to provide product materials and updates on new products and services, to respond to queries, and to provide order status and order tracking information to you. We may use your personal information for marketing research and marketing purposes, which may include sharing it with Volkswagen authorized dealerships, for customer service purposes, with outside research companies, or with service providers that provide marketing, research, or other services for us, including service providers that may be located outside of the United States. If you choose to save information, such as a vehicle configuration, on the Volkswagen Properties, we may contact you to follow up on your interest in our cars. ****
We may share your personal information (a) within the Volkswagen family of companies, which includes parents, corporate affiliates, subsidiaries, business units and other companies that share common ownership, including Volkswagen AG, (b) with other corporate partners, agencies and vendors working with Volkswagen, and (c) with your vehicle’s satellite radio and/or wireless service provider, if applicable, in order to enable those service providers to contact you with important information about your vehicle’s satellite or wireless services and for their own marketing purposes. In addition, we may share your personal information to comply with law or legal requirements, enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements, or protect our rights, property, or safety of our users, or others. We do not share your personal information with unaffiliated third parties for their marketing purposes, unless you consent to such sharing.
Personal information received from Volkswagen authorized dealerships may, in some cases, be used and shared in these ways.
If we or some or all of our assets are acquired by another company, including through a sale in connection with bankruptcy, that company will possess the information collected by us, and it will assume the rights and obligations regarding your information as described in this Privacy Policy.
We may share non-personal and aggregate information with our advertising agencies and other third-party affiliates to customize the design of the Volkswagen Properties.
Online Advertising
To provide you with a more relevant and interesting experience, Volkswagen may work with third party companies to display ads or customize the content of the Volkswagen Properties. These companies may use cookies (a small text file), pixels, tags, or similar technologies that are placed in browsers to gather information about your visits to a Volkswagen Property, as well as your visits elsewhere on the Internet. These companies use this information to provide you with more relevant advertising known as interest-based advertising. Some of these companies may be participants in the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”). The DAA offers a choice mechanism with respect to certain types of data collection and use. We adhere to the DAA’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising. Visit www.aboutads.info to exercise choice with respect to participants of the DAA. If you change computers, devices, or browsers, use multiple computers, devices, or browsers, or delete your cookies, you may need to repeat this process for each computer, device, or browser.
