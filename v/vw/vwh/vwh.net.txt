VERIO Company Information -Verio Privacy Policy
Verio Privacy Policy
Verio's policies and procedures for handling customer information have been created with the understanding that Internet technologies are still evolving and that Internet business methods are continuing to evolve to meet the needs and opportunities of the changing technologies. As a result, Verio's policies and procedures are subject to change.
In the course of serving its customers, Verio acquires, stores and transmits customer communications and information that customers may regard as private or sensitive. Some of this information - such as the customer's name, address, telephone number, and credit card data - is provided to Verio by its customers in order to establish service. Other information - such as the customer's account status, choice of services, and customer logs - is created and maintained by Verio in the normal course of providing service. Verio also uses cookies, which are small pieces of information that a web site can store in a designated file on a user's computer for various reasons. For example, Verio uses cookies on the landing pages of products sold online which record the customer information that is required on the order form. This information is then forwarded to an internal sales tracking database within Verio. In addition, Verio may store customers' electronic mail and other communications as a necessary incident to the transmission and delivery of those communications.
Data Security
Verio will protect the confidentiality of its customers' information, account information and personal communications to the fullest extent possible and consistent with the law and the legitimate interests of Verio, its partners, its employees and other customers of Verio's services. To protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of information that is collected from customers, Verio has appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures in place.
How is customer information used?
Verio may share customer information with selected partners, for example, to provide customers with information about products which might be of interest to the customer or to enable the customer to take advantage of special partner programs. Verio may also use customer information to provide its customers with system information or information about new or upgraded products.
In addition, Verio shares its web site usage information about visitors to Verio's web sites with a third-party advertising company, DoubleClick, for the purpose of targeting Verio's Internet banner advertisements on Verio's sites and other sites. For this purpose, Verio and DoubleClick note some of the pages visited on Verio's web site through the use of pixel tags (also called clear gifs). The information collected by DoubleClick through the use of these pixel tags is not personally identifiable. For more information about DoubleClick, customers may click here http://www.privacychoices.org.
Opt Out & Modifications
Customers may opt out of receiving notices of new or upgraded products from Verio and Verio partners by filling out this  on-line No Solicitation Request form. However, customers may not opt out of receiving information from Verio which is essential for maintaining or updating customers' accounts or system information.
Also, DoubleClick provides an opportunity to opt out of DoubleClick's targeting program at http://www.privacychoices.org/optout.htm.
Most customers may access and modify their personal information via their online personal control panel/account information page. All other customers may access and modify their personal information by contacting the appropriate Verio Billing organization.
Domain name customers who have registered a domain name with Verio and wish to change the Technical Contact from Verio to another company, may send a request to veriohostmaster@verio.net. It is important to note that customer domain name registration information is made publicly available in the registry of domain names.
Disclosure of customer information and communications
Verio will not otherwise disclose its customers' personal and account information unless Verio has reason to believe that disclosing such information is necessary to identify, make contact with, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing harm or interfering with the rights or property of Verio, Verio's customers, or others, or where Verio has a good faith belief that the law requires such disclosure.
Verio also will not, except for reasons stated below, disclose to third parties the contents of any electronic mail or other electronic communications that Verio stores or transmits for its customers. The circumstances under which Verio will disclose such electronic customer communications are when:
it is necessary in order to provide service to the customer;
it is necessary to protect the legitimate interests of Verio and its customers;
it is required to cooperate with interception orders, warrants, or other legal process that Verio determines in its sole discretion to be valid and enforceable; and
it is necessary to provide to a law enforcement agency when the contents are inadvertently obtained by Verio and appear to pertain to the commission of a crime.
Verio disclaims any intention to censor, edit or engage in ongoing review or surveillance of communications stored on or transmitted through its facilities by customers or others. Verio will, however, review, delete or block access to communications that may harm Verio, its customers or third parties. The grounds on which Verio may take such action include, but are not limited to, actual or potential violations of Verio's Acceptable Use Policy.
