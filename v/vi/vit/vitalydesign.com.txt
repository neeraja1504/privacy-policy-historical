Privacy Policy – Vitaly
The services on this site are offered to you by VITALY DESIGN Ltd., parent company of Vitaly. For the rest of this text, Vitaly Design will be used, but it is understood that Vitaly is a part of VITALY DESIGN Ltd.
Vitaly knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we’ll do so reasonably and safely. This notice describes our privacy policy. By visiting Vitaly, you’re accepting the practices described in this Privacy Notice. You can browse our site without revealing who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. Once you give us your personal information, you are no longer anonymous to us. If you choose to provide us with personal information, you consent to the transfer and storage of that information on our servers located in North America. We are hosted by Shopify and therefore, cannot know the exact physical location of each and every single server.
What Personal Information About Customers Does Vitaly Gather?
The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve your shopping experience at Vitaly. Here are the types of information we gather.
Information You Give Us : We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future shopping for you, improving our stores, and communicating with you, but we respect your privacy when we market our products and services.
Automatic Information : We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses Vitaly.
Certain information, although convenient for identification, is voluntary. It is up to you whether you want to provide this or other suitable identification, subject to any legal requirements.
We collect, use and disclose personal information only for purposes that a reasonable person would consider appropriate in the circumstances.
How Does Vitaly Handle Cookies?
Cookies are small files that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser, to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide features such as personalized greetings, and storage of items in your Shopping Cart between visits.
The "help" or “settings” section of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on’s settings or visiting the website of its manufacturer. Because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of Vitaly’s essential features, we recommend you leave them turned on. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be able to add items to your Shopping Cart, proceed to checkout, or use any Vitaly products and services that require you to sign in.
Third-Party Data Collection Technology
We use third-party, interest-based advertising services to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet. These third-party services display ads tailored to your individual interests based on how you browse and shop online. We allow third-party companies to collect certain information when you visit our website, this information is used to serve ads for our products and services when you visit this website or other websites. These third-party services use non-personally identifiable information (such as click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over, device and platform information, cookie and session IDs) and personally identifiable information (such as an IP address) during your visits to this and other websites to provide advertisements about goods and services believed to be of greater interest to you. These services typically collect this information using a cookie or a third party web beacon or clear gif. We do not currently respond to or process do no track signals from web browsers.
Does Vitaly Share The Information It Receives?
Information about our customers is a key part of our business, and we’re not in the business of selling it to others. We share customer information only as described below.
Third-Party Service Providers : We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf but, we do not sell to third parties any Personal Information. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.
Business Transfers : As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores, subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Vitaly or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information of course will be one of the transferred assets.
Protection of Vitaly and Others : We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Vitaly, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit-risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Notice.
With Your Consent : Other than as set out above, you’ll receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you’ll have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.
How Secure Is Information About Me?

Our site may include third-party advertising and links to other Web sites. We do not provide any personally identifiable customer information to these advertisers or third-party Web sites.
