Nielsen Mobile Brand Effect & Nielsen Online Brand Effect Cookie and Privacy Policy
Nielsen recognizes the importance of protecting privacy rights and we have created this Cookie and Privacy Policy to explain our data protection practices in relation to the Nielsen Online Brand Effect and Nielsen Mobile Brand Effect services provided by Nielsen NetRatings UK Limited and TNC (US) Holdings, Inc. If you have any additional questions as to this Policy and our use of information in relation to the services, please contact us by using the contact details found in the "Who can you contact for more information" section below.
How does the service work?
Nielsen Online Brand Effect and Nielsen Mobile Brand Effect provides a survey research and measurement service that monitors the performance of online and mobile advertising campaigns to help advertisers and marketers understand how effectively their digital advertising campaigns perform.
In relation to our Nielsen Online Brand Effect service, advertisers include a Nielsen Online Brand Effect tag in their ads and then place the ads on select sites around the web. The information collected includes the number of impressions each ad receives, how many individual ads in each campaign each viewer was exposed to, how many times each ad was displayed, and which site the viewer was on when the ad was displayed. The IP address of a viewer's computer, mobile or other device is not collected, recorded or stored.
In the mobile in-app environment, Nielsen Mobile Brand Effect uses a hashed version of a mobile device's ID to record whether an advertisement was displayed on a particular mobile device. The information collected using these unique identifiers is limited to a list of the advertising creative units in the campaigns that were displayed on the device, the apps in which the advertisements appeared, along with the number of times each ad unit was shown and the day/time of each exposure.
The service also presents a single survey question randomly to a small subset of the viewers of an advertising campaign. This question is a multiple choice question with a predetermined set of answer choices related to the primary marketing objective of the ad campaign. Responses are voluntary. If the viewer responds to a survey question, the response is stored in a database. The surveys do not ask for or collect any personal data.
The collected information is analyzed and reported to the advertisers and marketers who manage advertising campaigns on both an aggregated and a respondent level basis.
