Online Privacy Policy
The St Vincent de Paul Society of Australia (the “Society”) is committed to protecting your privacy in accordance with the National Privacy Principles.  Consistent with the Privacy Act 1988 as amended by the Privacy Amendment (Private Sector) Act 2000 (the Act), the Society endorses fair information handling practices. Any information provided, including identification of individuals, will be used only for the purpose for which it has been collected.
Personal information is confidential and is not passed on to any other agency without your permission.
Statistical information is shared with other departments and agencies. An example of this would be reporting to government agencies regarding the number of people accessing our homeless or aged care facilities.
If you wish to access the information we hold about you or have any questions about this please contact the Society’s head office in your State.
Information that has been collected will be amended if you consider details are incorrect.
Any personal information that is considered to be beyond its "use by" date will be destroyed.
Reasonable steps will be taken to ensure that any personal information collected will be held secure and only accessible by appointed "key" holders.
