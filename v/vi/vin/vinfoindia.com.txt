This Privacy Policy is effective as of April 13, 2006. Our business changes constantly. This Privacy Policy will change also, and use of information that we gather now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time of use. We may e-mail periodic reminders of material changes to our Privacy Policy, unless you have instructed us not to, but you should check our web site frequently to see recent changes.

What information does the Web site gather?
When you visit this site you may provide information on two different levels about your visit:
Anonymous statistics collected as you browse the site
Personal information you knowingly give us
Please be assured that we do not collect personal information about you from the website unless you provide it to us. This means that you can visit our Web sites without telling us who you are or revealing any personally identifiable information about yourself (such as your e-mail address).
As you browse the site, our web servers collect information about your visit, not about you personally. Via web server logs, we monitor statistics such as:
How many people visit our site
Which pages people visit on our site
From which domains our visitors come (e.g., aol.com, google.com, yahoo.com)
Which browsers people use to visit our site
None of this information is associated with you as an individual (see information about cookies below). We use these statistics to improve our Web site, to monitor its performance, and to make the Web site easier for you and other visitors to use.
What about pages that ask for personal information?
When visitors supply information about themselves for a specific purpose, we use the information for that purpose (such as to provide the service or information the visitor has requested). For example, you may be asked to give us individual information to purchase a product or service, receive information, manage online account registration, or apply for a job. The information may range from your zip code, to your phone number, account number, a credit card number, age, gender, mother's maiden name, social security number, e-mail address, organization URL, resume, or mailing address.
When visitors use our Web site to order services, we may use this personally identifiable information as we would use the same information obtained in a traditional non-electronic manner. For example, to publish your name, address, and phone number in our directories (unless you have requested a non-published number), or to evaluate your service needs and contact you regarding additional services you may find useful. If you do not want us to contact you, you can remove your name from our telephone or mail solicitation lists by clicking on Contact Us. Please note that this removes your name from vinfoindia.com, however, to be removed from other websites in the Shyam InfoNet family of companies, contact them directly.

VinfoIndia asks parents or legal guardians to assist VinfoIndia by supervising the activities of children at this web site.
What happens to information when I fill out registration forms?
The registration forms request accurate contact information (like name and e-mail address) and preferences that help us better serve you. Your name and e-mail address are used to send you information about our company, product updates, special offers, and newsletters. You may change your email, user ID or password online; or you can choose to remove your name from our user list by going to Contact Us and emailing us a request to remove your name.
To improve the services we can offer you, we may decide to expand the site's capabilities for obtaining information about users in the future. We will update this privacy statement as policies change to ensure that you are aware of developments in this area.
Do you sell or give my information to companies outside of the "VinfoIndia Family? "
We do not sell or disclose personally identifiable information obtained online about our visitors, to anyone outside of the "VinfoIndia Family" unless you specifically authorize it, to complete a transaction that you initiated, it is required by law, or disclosure is necessary to protect the safety of customers, employees or property. If you provide personally identifiable information to us in the context of an event VinfoIndia sponsors with another company, such as a contest, or if you register on a co-sponsored site or feature, you may also be providing the personally identifiable information to the co-sponsor. This will be made clear to you before you submit the information and you can decide whether or not to participate.
VinfoIndia may share non-personally identifiable information with non-"VinfoIndia Family" companies in order to assess the results of a promotion, event or third party relationship, to provide information to current or prospective customers, to complete a search or to otherwise enhance your online experience. For example, we may provide statistical information that is not identified with you:
The number of people who visit the website, which pages were visited and for how long, the referral URL, the user's IP address, and the User Agent. When we host co-branded versions of the vinfoindia.com site (or portions of the vinfoindia.com site). Our co-branded sites may also contain clear GIFs (electronic images that allow this site to collect anonymous information about your visit to the site). Non-personally identifiable information may also be disclosed to non-VinfoIndia-Family companies if it is required by law, or disclosure is necessary to protect the safety of customers, employees or property.
This does not contain any information that would personally identify you. In addition, VinfoIndia may support features and content that appear on other companies' web sites that you may visit. These companies may collect information about you, but VinfoIndia does not have control over the collection practices of these companies. If you are visiting a web site that indicates that it is "powered by vinfoindia.com.com," you are advised to read the privacy policy of that web site for its policies regarding information collection and usage.
Does this site send e-mail to site visitors?
At times, online surveys are conducted in which you can choose to participate. In addition, we may use e-mail to communicate with our customers, to respond to visitors' e-mail, to confirm orders placed online, and to send information that a visitor has requested. Occasionally, we may use opt-in e-mail lists from third parties to promote our latest specials. If you receive an unwanted e-mail from us, you can click Contact Us and simply ask us to remove you from our list.
Do you accommodate links to other sites?
This website contains links to other web sites. These other web sites may, among other things, allow you to bid on and/or purchase products that you initially viewed on this web site. These other web sites may (or may not) be co-branded with VinfoIndia or vinfoindia.com.com branding. You can tell if you have linked from one web site to another web site by looking at the URL in the browser window. If the second level domain of the URL for the page containing the link is different than the second level domain of the URL for the page to which you have linked, you have linked to a different web site. For example, if you link from a page located at the URL www.thirdleveldomain.vinfoindia.com.com to a page located at the URL www.vinfoindia.com.secondleveldomain.com, you have linked to another site. Please note that any of VinfoIndia's trademarks or service marks (e.g., vinfoindia.com) may be included in the URL of a co-branded or private label web site that is owned and operated by a third party, in a location other than that occupied by the second level domain (e.g., as the third level domain). The companies that own or operate these web sites may track and/or collect information about you, but VinfoIndia does not have control over the privacy practices (including, without limitation, those relating to tracking user activity, collection of user data, use of user data, and security) of these companies (although, when a user activates a link from this web site one of these other web sites, VinfoIndia may pass the user's referral URL and IP address to the server hosting such other site). We are not responsible for the privacy policies or practices (including, without limitation, those related to tracking, collection, use and security) employed by (or in connection with) other sites, and we are not responsible for the content on, or operation of, other sites (including, without limitation, any transactions conducted through such other sites). We are committed to safeguarding customer privacy on our website.

The visitor must either continue to decline cookies each time it reenters the site to keep the tracking severed, if desired, or opt-out. When you opt-out, your unique user ID cookie is erased and you are reassigned an anonymous, non-id cookie. This new cookie tells websites that you have opted out and they will then know not to attempt to assign other cookies to you in the future. Opt-out cookies do not contain a unique user ID number therefore websites are not able to identify your computer uniquely.
Customers who choose to continually delete cookies and not opt out can have their browser advise them each time a web site attempts to send a cookie to your system. At that time, you can choose to either Accept or Cancel a cookie.
Customers who choose to "opt out" after deleting cookies will receive an anonymous/non personally identifiable cookie.
Does VinfoIndia use the information provided online to profile its customers?
The combination of offline and online information provided by the customer has the ability to enhance the customer experience, and make the consumer's interaction with VinfoIndia more meaningful and relevant. VinfoIndia requires notification of any consumer profiling or purchasing behavior being captured by VinfoIndia online and combined with offline information be clearly stated to the consumer at the time of online data collection.
