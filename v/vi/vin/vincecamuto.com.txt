SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION
The VC Website relies on the use of reasonable physical, electronic, contractual and managerial measures to safeguard and maintain all personally-identifiable information provided by you through the VC Website on computer servers in a controlled and secured environment in an effort to restrict and impair unauthorized access, loss, alteration, use or disclosure of such information. However, the nature of the Internet is such that information may be transmitted over networks without appropriate security measures and may be accessed, deleted, altered, used or disclosed by unauthorized persons.
Because of the world-wide nature of the services and products provided by this Website and the nature of the business supporting Vince Camuto, LLC d/b/a Camuto Group, personal data may, subject to applicable laws, be transferred internationally amongst the entities responsible for creating and selling the Camuto Group lines, for the purposes described above. This may result in personal data being transferred to countries which do not have laws or regulations protecting personal data, such as the United States. We use reasonable measures to limit the disclosure and processing of the data you provide to us only to certain staff within our operating entities and our affiliates, namely those staff members, contractors and affiliates who must process your inquiries and other customer services requests or those who are responsible for administering the VC Website.
The VC Website also takes precautions to keep your personally-identifiable financial information private and safe. The VC Website relies on current, industry-standard technology to encrypt your order information and to process your credit card information in a secure area of the site. Although the VC Website uses its best efforts to take such precautions with your personally-identifiable financial information, you understand and acknowledge through your use of this Site that no transmission of data over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure and we cannot guarantee that such information will not be intercepted and/or misused by third parties.
PHISHING
"Phishing" refers to the attempt by a third-party to criminally and fraudulently acquire sensitive information such as user names, passwords and credit card details from Internet users, by masquerading as a trustworthy entity, and is a type of Internet scam that is becoming increasingly common and pervasive. To avoid being a victim of this scam, be wary of emails that you receive from what appear to be legitimate sources, such as the VC Website, seeking to collect your personally-identifiable information through such means as a hypertext link incorporated in such email. If the VC Website needs to verify your personally-identifiable information in order to process an order request or a service request submitted by you, such verification will not be done through an email incorporating these hypertext links. If you do encounter this type of email or are suspicious that any email you allegedly receive from the VC Website is fraudulent, please forward the email to the VC Website at customerservice@VinceCamuto.com and contact Customer Service directly. We will investigate all instances of possible Internet fraud.
