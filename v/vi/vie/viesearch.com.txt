Information we collect
· When you perform a search using Viesearch, we anonymously store only the keyword and time of your request. No personal identifiable information is attached to these two pieces of data.
· When you submit a website for inclusion in our search engine, you give us certain information voluntarily. This may include the title, description, and URL. Additionally, if your submission is approved, we may visit and attempt to categorize your website appropriately. We may also create a thumbnail preview image by creating a screenshot of your website as it appears at the moment of approval. If you do not provide a custom Title and Description for a URL you submit, we may gather the html title and meta description tags. We may also gather your meta keywords to help categorize your listing appropriately.
· When you register an account, you give us certain information voluntarily. This may include your username, name, email, a password of your choice, and a URL of a graphic avatar of your choice. We encrypt your password.
· When you visit Viesearch, we anonymously store your session id, the URL you request, and the date and time you request it in our traffic logs. If the URL you request contains a search term or keyword, it is removed from the URL before it enters the log system. No personal identifiable information is attached to these three pieces of data.
What we do with information we collect
· We use search keyword data to publicly and anonymously show popular and trending searches made using Viesearch.
· We use website submission data to create a separate listing for every URL added to our search engine. This information is also then made available in our search results after manual review.
· Once you become a member you are given the choice to subscribe to various newsletters and alerts. These mailings and alerts can be turned on or off in your Viesearch account at anytime. Every email we send contains an unsubscribe link at the bottom. The unsubscribe link instantly removes you from any and ALL mailings.
· We have legitimate interest in using our traffic log data to help protect our search engine service from abusive automated traffic. During times of high network load, or repeated loading of a specific URL, in order to maintain our service, we may automatically rate limit visitors and/or crawlers and/or bots using this data.
How long we keep your information
We keep your information only so long as we need it to provide Viesearch to you and fulfill the purposes described in this policy. When we no longer need to use your information and there is no need for us to keep it to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, we'll either remove it from our systems or depersonalize it so that we can't identify you.
· Search keyword and time information is automatically erased after 1 hour.
