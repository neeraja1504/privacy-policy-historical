To process your order, we may collect your full name, email address, phone number, product serial number, home address, mobile phone number, credit card information, and shipping address.
If you choose not to provide this information, we may not be able to provide the corresponding ViewSonic products and services or respond to your inquiries.

ViewSonic might also ask for information about your interests, or for feedback about the Website so that we can improve the Website and/or its service. Providing ViewSonic with this information is always optional.
Information We Automatically Collect. In addition to the information ViewSonic collects directly from you, we also monitor and track usage of our website, viewing and traffic patterns, customer behavior, and other similar information. This information is compiled into a statistical aggregate. This aggregate information is also used, in conjunction with your personal information, for ViewSonic’s internal business and administrative purposes including improvements to the Website, ViewSonic’s product and service offerings, our operations, or our customer service. This information may be obtained from the following sources:
Via unconditional data capture measures such as the use of cookies and studying the pages you read frequently (please see our Cookie Policy below).

ViewSonic uses a third party tool, Google Analytics, to analyze traffic on the Website. Google Analytics does not create individual profiles for visitors. Unlike some tracking services, Google Analytics does not have a database of individual profiles for each visitor. Google Analytics only collects aggregate data.
During the time you are registered as active with ViewSonic, we will log and record on our secure database calls, emails, meetings, texts, events and any other relevant information.

From time to time, ViewSonic may sell a business or a part of a business to another person or company. Such a transfer of ownership could include the transfer of your personal data directly related to that business to the purchasing person or company.

Furthermore, ViewSonic is free to use any ideas, concepts, know-how, or techniques contained in any communication you send to this website for any purpose whatsoever, including but not limited to developing manufacturing and marketing products using such information.
3. How does ViewSonic.com respond to ‘Do Not Track Signals’?
Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. We do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT.
