Privacy Policy
VIEO Design™, LLC (hereafter "we" or "us") recognizes that you care how information about you is used and shared. We created this privacy policy to inform you of our information collection, use, and sharing practices pertaining to this website. Please also review our terms and conditions.
Please be advised that the practices described in this privacy policy apply only to information gathered through this website and, where applicable, through our customer service department in connection with this website, and do not necessarily reflect our practices with respect to information gathered through other websites that we operate or through offline means.
If you have any questions or concerns regarding this privacy policy, please contact our customer service department and we'll be happy to address them.
What information about me is collected and stored?
We store information that is collected through this website or that you provide to our sales or project management team. For example, when you subscribe or download an offer, we collect and store the information that you provide. Likewise, when you become a customer, we store your name, billing address, email address, telephone number, credit card number, and credit card expiration date.
This information is used to provide the content and services that you have ordered or requested, to process orders, to send order confirmations, and to provide customer service. This information also may be used for our own marketing and internal business purposes, and to contact you about special offers and new site features, unless you have opted not to receive promotional communications in connection with this website.
We collect and store certain other information automatically whenever you interact with this website. For example, we collect your IP address, browser information and reference site domain name every time you visit this website. We also collect information regarding customer traffic patterns and site usage. This information is used to analyze and improve this website and to provide our customers with a fulfilling experience.
Also, like many websites, we use “cookies,” which are files stored on your computer’s hard drive by your browser. Cookies do not contain personally identifiable information. Cookies help us identify return visitors and optimize their browsing experiences. Cookies are not used on this website to store your account information; that information is stored securely on this website’s server. Also, we will use cookies to monitor and maintain information about your use of this website.
Cookies are also used to track the identity of the website you visited immediately prior to visiting this website (i.e. the site you came from); otherwise, we do not track information about your use of other websites. Most browsers accept cookies automatically but allow you to disable them. We recommend that you leave cookies “turned on” so that we can offer you a better experience on this website. We also may collect and store information about you that we receive from other sources, to enable us to update and correct the information contained in our database and to provide product recommendations and special offers that we think will interest you.
Is information collected from children?
This website is not intended or directed to anyone under the age of 18. We do not sell any items through this website directly to anyone who we know to be under the age of 18, nor do we collect any personal information from anyone who we know to be under the age of 18. If you are under the age of 18, you should use this website only with the involvement of a parent or guardian and should not submit any personal information to us.
With whom do you share information?
We do not share, sell, or rent to others any personal information that you provide to us through this website or through our customer service department, except with your consent or as described in this privacy policy.
We engage third parties to perform services in connection with the operation of our business. Examples of these services include payment processing and authorization, fraud protection and credit risk reduction, product customization, marketing and promotional material distribution, website evaluation, data analysis and, where applicable, data cleansing. We provide personal information to these third parties, but we authorize them to use this information only in connection with the services they perform.
We may release personal information if we believe in good faith that: the law or legal process requires it; we have received a valid administrative request from a law enforcement agency; or such release is necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of VIEO Design, LLC, or any of our respective affiliates, business partners, customers or others.
We may share non-personal information with our marketing partners, advertisers and others from time to time. Examples of such non-personal information include the number of users who visited this website during a specific time period or purchased a specific product through this website. This information generally is shared in an aggregated form.
As with any business, it is possible that as our business develops, we might sell or buy online assets. In such transactions, information about customers often is among the transferred assets. Accordingly, in the event that VIEO Design, LLC or substantially all of our respective assets are acquired by a third party, such information may be one of the transferred assets (unless the information was collected under a previous privacy policy that did not permit such disclosure). Under such circumstances, VIEO Design, LLC would to the extent possible require the acquiring party to follow the practices described in this privacy policy.
What steps are taken to keep personal information secure?
We use various security measures, including Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology, to protect personal information that we collect. If you create an account or make a payment through this website, you will be asked to provide an email address and password. You must provide an appropriate email address and password in order to access account information. In order to help protect your personal information further, you should be careful about providing your password to others. If you wish to cancel a password, or if you become aware of any loss, theft or unauthorized use of a password, please contact our customer service department.
What happens when I follow a link to or from another website?
This website contains links to websites operated by third parties. Please be advised that the practices described in this privacy policy do not apply to information gathered through these other websites. We encourage you to be aware of when you leave this website and to read the privacy policies of each and every website that you visit.
If you have accessed this website through a link from certain of our advertising or marketing partners, this website may include a frame of the applicable advertising or marketing partner. Nevertheless, the information you provide to us through these framed web pages is collected by us, and our use of this information is governed by this privacy policy.
What about contests and sweepstakes?
When we run a contest or sweepstakes relating to this website, it will be accompanied by a set of rules. The rules for each contest/sweepstakes will specify how the information gathered from you for entry will be used and disclosed.
What about online surveys?
We may from time to time conduct online surveys. When you complete an online survey, we may ask for certain information including your age, zip code, shopping habits, email and/or mailing address. This information will be treated in accordance with this privacy policy.
