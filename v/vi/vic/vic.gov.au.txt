What information do we collect?
There are 3 main ways that we may collect personal information from you:

Some personal information is automatically collected as a result of your visit to our website. This information is collected using software techniques such as web server log file analysis, cookies and web beacons.
3. Automatic collection by third party software vendors

When you visit our website, your web browser automatically sends certain information to these software providers.

Requests to provide information
We may collect personal information that you choose to give us, or which may be required to access a particular service. This includes information collected via online forms, events and training registration, or when subscribing to receive newsletters.
The information you provide by completing an online form on vic.gov.au is collected by the Drupal 8 content management system (CMS) and is stored on the Amazon Web Services infrastructure in Sydney, Australia. The Product and Editorial team within Digital, Design and Innovation have a process in place to delete this data from the CMS on a regular basis.

Use and disclosure
Use of web analytics data
We use web analytics data for statistical purposes, such as to analyse, measure, and report on data about our website traffic and visits. This information helps us understand general user trends at an aggregate level, and improve our website, content, and user experience.
We may also use this information for security audits to protect against threats from hackers or other security purposes.
We do not use this information to identify you or match it with any other personal information that we may collect from you, unless required to do so as part of an internal investigation or for a law enforcement-related purpose, in accordance with the PDP Act.
Your site visit data is collected under the authority of Information Privacy Principle 1.1 of the PDP Act for the purposes stated above.
Disclosure of web analytics data
Apart from the third party tools described in this Privacy Statement, we do not disclose your site visit data to any other third parties without your consent, unless we are required or authorised to do so by law. In the event of an investigation into suspected unlawful or improper activity, a law enforcement or government agency may use its legal authority to inspect our web server’s records (e.g. in relation to hacking or abusive messages).
Can I opt out of the collection of web analytics data?
You cannot opt out of the automatic collection of information that is used for analytical purposes, however you may choose to disable cookies or delete any individual cookie. If you choose to disable cookies, the website may not function fully and your ability to browse, read, and download information contained on our website may be impaired. However, you may still access our services by contacting our office via other methods such as telephone, email, or mail.
You can enable a “Do Not Track” setting on your browser to help protect your privacy. When Do Not Track is tuned on, your browser will send a Do Not Track request to the sites you visit, and to the third parties whose content is hosted on those sites. However, many websites will still collect and use your browsing data regardless of the Do Not Track Request. This depends on individual sites’ privacy practices. Sending a Do Not Track request does not guarantee privacy protection.
Instructions on how to enable the Do Not Track setting:
Google Chrome
Internet Explorer 11
Mozilla Firefox
Safari
