Cookies
Library websites use cookies. A cookie is a small piece of code placed on your computer which allows us to record information about your visit.
We use cookies to record usage statistics for this site, such as the number of visits, documents viewed, browser type, and the way the site is navigated.  In using these cookies, we do not retrieve or record any personal information such as names or email addresses. The anonymous statistical data we collect may be aggregated and used in broader statistical analysis or to assist in making your experience easier and more efficient.
Analytics
The Library uses analytics tools, such as Google Analytics, for the capture and provision of website statistics. These services use cookies. In addition some tools such as Google Analytics use a ‘web beacon’ or transparent image. Web beacons are a convenient way of gathering the statistics and managing cookies. Users can ‘opt out’ of Google Analytics if they use the opt-out service provided by Google.
Security of your personal information
There are risks associated with transmitting information over the internet. The Library implements various mechanisms to protect the security and integrity of personal information.
