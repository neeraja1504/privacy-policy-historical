Information Collection
Personal information is collected from customers only after obtaining consent, which is acquired when customers are prompted for information when subscribing to the services, downloading a product, or requesting information from the company.

You need to acknowledge, however, that, although VicMan does its best to protect your personal data, the company cannot pledge its absolute safety. The reason for it is that whenever you publicly disclose information on the company's website (e.g. leave comments or reviews), that information can easily be seen, collected or used by any other unauthorized people.
