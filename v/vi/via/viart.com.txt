ViArt LLC are committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information we collect about you to process orders and to provide a more personalised shopping experience.
Collection & Use Of Information |
---|---
When you order, we need to know your name, e-mail address, delivery address, credit or debit card number and start, expiry or issue date. This allows us to process and fulfil your orders and to notify you of your order status.
We also ask for your telephone number which enables us to contact you urgently if there is a problem with your order.
When you enter a competition or promotional feature, we may ask for your name, address and e-mail address so we can administer the contest and notify winners.
We also monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage to help us develop the design and layout of the site.
We may also use the information we collect to occasionally notify you about important functionality changes to the web site, new services and special offers we think you'll find useful. If you would rather not receive this information, please send an email to support@viart.com
We do not send random marketing emails to personal email addresses (spam).
Protection Of Customer Information |

When you place orders or access your order information, we offer the use of a secure server. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us.
Furthermore, as required by the Data Protection Acts of 1984 and 1998, we follow strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of information which you have given us, to prevent unauthorised access.
Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we are able to disclose sensitive information to you.
