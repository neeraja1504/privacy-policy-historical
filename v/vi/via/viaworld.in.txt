This section of the Privacy Policy applies to all Users.
A condition of each User's use of and access to the Websites, Mobile Applications and to the other services provided by Via to End Users (together with the Websites and Mobile Applications, the ("Services") is his/her/its acceptance of the terms of use available at Via.com ("Terms of Use"), which also involves acceptance of the terms of this Privacy Policy. Any User who does not agree with any provisions of the same is required to leave the Websites and/or stop using and delete the Mobile Applications immediately.
When browsing the Websites, a User is not required to provide Personal Information unless and until such User chooses to avail or sign up for any of the Services.
Due to the communications standards on the Internet, when a User visits the Website, Via automatically receives the URL of the site from which such User came and the site to which such User is going when he/she/it leaves. Via also receives the Internet Protocol ("IP") address of each User's computer (or the proxy server a User used to access the Internet), the User's computer operating system and type of web browser the User is using, email patterns, as well as the name of User's ISP. This information is used to analyze overall Users' trends to help Via improve its Services. The linkage between User's IP address and User's personally identifiable information is not shared with third-parties without such User's permission or except when required by law or except where required to provide or facilitate the Services. Notwithstanding the above, the User acknowledges Via's right to share some of the aggregate findings (not the specific data) with advertisers, sponsors, investors, strategic partners, and others in order to help grow its business.
The Websites and the Mobile Applications use temporary cookies to store certain data. Via does not store personally identifiable information in the cookies.

However, Users are encouraged to use the "clear cookies" functionality of their browsers to ensure deletion, as Via cannot guarantee, predict or provide for the behaviour of the equipment of all the Users of the Websites.

Via hereby expressly disclaims any liability for any misuse of such information that is made available by Users in such a manner, neither does Via warrant or guarantee any such data or communication.
Via does not collect information about the Users of the Websites and the Mobile Applications from other sources, such as public records or bodies, or private organisations, save and except for the purposes of registration of the End Users.

Via may also disclose or transfer the personal and other information provided by the Users, to any thirty party as part of reorganization or a sale of the assets of a Via corporation division or company.

Nevertheless, certain provisions of this Privacy Policy are applicable to Visitors, and Visitors are also required to read and understand the privacy statements set out herein, failing which they are required to leave the Websites immediately.
A User will not merely be a Visitor if the User has willingly submitted any personal data or information (including phone numbers, email ids, responses to surveys, etc.) to Via through any means, including email, post, telephone calls, telephonic messaging or through the registration process on the Websites or downloaded the Mobile Application(s) on your mobile telecommunications device. All such visitors will be deemed to be, and will be treated as, End Users for the purposes of this Privacy Policy, and in which case, all the statements in this privacy policy apply to the User.
If you, as a Visitor, have inadvertently browsed any other pages of the Websites prior to reading the privacy statements set out herein, and you do not agree with the manner in which information is obtained, stored or used, merely quitting this browser application should ordinarily clear all temporary cookies installed by Via.

Verification of credit information, however, is accomplished solely by the End User through the authentication process. The End User's credit-card/debit card details are transacted upon secure sites of approved payment gateways which are digitally under encryption, thereby providing the industry standard degree of care as per current technology.
