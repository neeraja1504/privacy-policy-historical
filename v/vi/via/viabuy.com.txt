Special categories of personal data
PPRO does not intentionally collect any special categories of personal data (sensitive personal information) via Our Sites or App unless in a specific country we are legally required to do so, for example, for recruitment purposes. Sensitive personal information includes: information revealing racial or ethnic origin; political opinions; religious or philosophical beliefs; trade union membership; the processing of genetic or biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person; information concerning health; information concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation; and in some cases, social security numbers or financial information.
Security
PPRO works to protect the confidentiality and security of information it obtains in the course of its business. Access to such information is limited and policies and procedures are in place, designed to safeguard the information from loss, misuse and improper disclosure.
How we collect information about you
Most of the personal information we hold about you is collected directly from you. We do this for example, when you
visit Our Sites and apply for a prepaid product;
start an application for a prepaid product but fail to complete it;
make enquiries or raise concerns with our customer service team;
use our App;
register to receive information from us or sign up to our newsletter;
download e-books and other information from Our Sites;
contact us directly, either via our call centre, by email or social media;
register with us for recruitment and vacancy updates;
apply for a vacancy on Our Sites;

accept the use of Cookies.
We will also collect information about you if you get in touch through one of our external partners (for instance, if you apply for a job vacancy using a third party provider, such as a recruitment agency or SmartRecruiters, our Applicant Tracking System.
In order to understand more about you and to verify your identity, we may supplement and combine the personal information that we collect from you with other categories of data obtained from other sources.
We may change or add to these from time to time and the changes will be updated on our Privacy Policy.
Information we collect on social media platforms
You may wish to participate in the social media platforms which we make available to you. The main aim of these social media platforms is to inform, assist and engage with you. We monitor and record comments and posts made on these channels so that we can improve our products and services. We use a third-party provider, Falcon.io ApS, to manage our social media interactions. If you send us a private or direct message via social media the message will be stored by Falcon.io ApS for three years.
PPRO may also provide links to other social media platforms maintained on separate servers by individuals or organisations over which PPRO has no control. PPRO makes no representations or warranties regarding the accuracy or any other aspect of the information located on such servers.
A link to a third party’s website should not be construed as an endorsement by either PPRO or that third party of each other or its products and services. Furthermore, PPRO is not responsible for any information posted on those websites other than information we have posted ourselves. We do not endorse the social media websites themselves, or any information posted on them by third parties or other users.
We recommend reviewing the privacy statement of each third-party site linked from Our Sites to determine their use of your personal information:
Twitter
Facebook
Linkedin
Google+

We use this information to help you with your queries and to help improve our service’s efficiency and effectiveness.
We may also monitor or record phone calls with you in case we need to check that we have carried out your instructions correctly, to resolve queries or issues, for regulatory purposes, to help improve our quality of service, and to help detect or prevent fraud or other crimes. Conversations may also be monitored and/or recorded for staff training purposes.

Unless specifically mentioned otherwise, we keep your personal data (name, address, contact details) for a minimum of 6 years after which time it will be destroyed.
Where you have consented to us using your details for direct marketing, we will keep such data until you notify us otherwise and/or withdraw your consent.

For fraud prevention purposes :
Your records will be deleted 7 years after your fraud record is created;
Fraud prevention agencies can hold your personal data for different periods of time, depending on how that data is being used. Please contact them for more information.

Our Sites and App use Cookies, Web Beacons and other web technologies such as CAPTCHA’s, as applicable, to improve their performance and to enhance your browsing experience. These technologies will help us track and monitor your engagement and usage of Our Sites and App, to understand more about you, so we can offer you a more personalised browsing experience.
Cookies
We may place small data files on your access device. These data files may be cookies or other local storage provided by your browser or associated applications (collectively, “Cookies”). We use Cookies to recognise you as a customer, customise our services, content and advertising, measure promotional effectiveness, help ensure that your account security is not compromised, mitigate risk and prevent fraud, and to promote trust and safety across our Sites and services.
What Cookies we use
The Cookies used by Our Sites or App can be:
Transient (or per-session) Cookies - these only exist for your site visit and are deleted on exit. They recognise you as you move between pages, for example, recording items added to an online shopping basket. These Cookies also help maintain security.
Persistent (or permanent) Cookies - these stay on your machine until expiry or deletion. Many are built with automatic deletion dates to help ensure your hard drive does not get overloaded. These Cookies often store and re-enter your log-in information, so you don’t need to remember membership details.
We use both types of Cookies.
Additionally, Cookies can be first or third party Cookies. First-party Cookies are owned and created by the website you’re viewing. Third-party Cookies are owned and created by an independent company, usually a company providing a service to the website owners. These Cookies collect information relating to the origin of your visit, where you were exposed to PPRO advertising, what advertising feature you saw, whether you arrived directly or indirectly to Our Sites, the device you used to visit Our Sites or use our App and which downloads you performed.

Web Beacons
We use small graphics (also called tracking pixels or clear GIFs – collectively, “Web Beacons”) in Our Sites, App or emails which remain invisible to you but provide us with information about your experience and interaction with Our Sites, App and emails such as which browser has been used, if an email was opened and similar. As part of our effort to track the success of our advertising campaigns, we may at times use visitor identification technology such as these "web beacons” which count visitors who have come to Our Sites after being exposed to a PPRO banner ad on a third party site. Web Beacons often work in conjunction with Cookies. No personally identifiable or sensitive personal data is collected via Web Beacons.
By navigating on Our Sites or using our App, you agree that we can place Cookies on your computer or device and use Web Beacons, as applicable. If you prefer not to receive Cookies, then you should consult your browsing settings or stop using Our Sites.
