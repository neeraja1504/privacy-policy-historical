We transfer information about you if VibeThemes is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, VibeThemes will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
VibeThemes displays targeted offers based on personal information. Advertisers may assume that people who interact with, view, or click on targeted offers meet the targeting criteria – for example, women ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area.

However, by interacting with or viewing an offer you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad.
