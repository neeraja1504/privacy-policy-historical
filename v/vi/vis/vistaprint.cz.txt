Cookies and my Vistaprint website
The law around cookies has changed recently. The changes mean that anyone who operates a website that uses cookies needs to change the way they inform their visitors/customers about cookies.
We only use one cookie on Vistaprint hosted websites like yours. We use this cookie to count the number of unique visitors, so we know how many people visit the websites we host and to report that to you via your website dashboard.

These cookies do not originate from our hosting servers and we have no control over them.
What does it mean for you and your website?
You will need to choose an option to obtain your visitors and customers consent to use cookies that are set on your web site; the Information Commissioners Office (ICO) recently stated that implied consent is an acceptable form of consent for this purpose.

Changes to this Cookies Policy
This Cookies Policy was last modified on February, 2013. As part of our ongoing initiative to comply with recent law changes, we may revise this policy from time to time by posting a revised policy on our website. We reserve the right to modify this policy at any time, so please review it frequently.
Privacy Policy
We recognise the importance of maintaining your privacy. We value your privacy and appreciate your trust in us. This Privacy Policy applies to current and former visitors to our website and to our online customers.
By visiting and/or using our website, you agree to this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy explains the information practices that apply to personally identifiable information that we collect about you as an individual when you visit and/or use our website. Any information that we collect about you while you are visiting or using our website will be handled in accordance with this Privacy Policy and will not be shared except in accordance with this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information about you collected by our affiliates or third party websites that may post links or advertisements on or otherwise be accessible from our website. The information collected by these affiliates or third party websites is subject to their own privacy policies.
Information We Collect
This section of our Privacy Policy describes the categories of information collected by Vistaprint. All data that we collect is processed and stored in Devonshire, Bermuda. You have the option not to provide information, however, withholding information may prevent you from being able to use some of our website features.
Information Collected Automatically: Whenever you visit our website, we automatically collect some information about your transactions with us, and your use of our website. For example, we automatically collect your IP address, for Vistaprint internal use only, such as to help us diagnose problems with our server and administer our website. We also automatically track certain information about your activities on our website such as the type of web browser you are using and click stream data. If you are a registered Vistaprint customer, we link this automatically-collected data to the personally identifiable information we collect about you described below. We use this information to do internal research on your interests and to help us better understand and serve you.
Information You Send To Us If you choose to provide us with personal information, such as by sending us an e-mail or by filling out a form with your personal information and submitting it to us through our website, we collect the personal information that you provide to us. For example, if you register or sign up for an account with us, we collect your name, e-mail address, telephone number and password. If you place an order with us, we collect the personal information that you provide to us such as your shipping, billing, and payment information.
Information about Your Transactions with Us: In addition, we collect your order information and purchase and payment history.
Use and Disclosure of Information
We use the information that we collect about you to maintain, improve, and administer our website, operate our business, provide products and services that you request, administer your account, inform you about products and services that might be of interest to you, and personalize your online experience.
In order to carry out certain business functions, such as order fulfillment, e-mail delivery, or marketing, we sometimes hire other companies to perform services on our behalf. We may disclose personally identifiable information that we collect about you to these companies to enable them to perform these services, but they are required to safeguard the data and are not authorised to use it for any other purpose than completing their contractual requirements to Vistaprint. For example, as a part of the normal process of completing your purchase, Vistaprint may provide your personal data to a third party payment processor, such as WorldPay Ltd., depending on your chosen method of payment. Please be aware that, because of the limitations of the systems used by some financial institutions, the statement you receive from your credit card or financial institution may show the name of a third party payment processor, such as WorldPay Ltd., instead of or in addition to the Vistaprint name. In addition, we may share the information we collect with other companies with whom we have joint marketing arrangements. We may also disclose information, including personal information, we collect about you in other circumstances as required or permitted by law. For example, Vistaprint reserves the right to disclose personal information, including account information, when we believe such disclosure is appropriate to cooperate with an investigation of activities claimed to be unlawful, to enforce our Terms of Use, or to protect the rights or property of Vistaprint or others. In addition, it is possible that in the future another company may acquire Vistaprint or its assets. It is also possible that Vistaprint may partner with or purchase another company to continue to do business as a combined entity. In the event that this occurs, it is possible that our customer information, including your personal information, may be transferred to the new business entity as one of Vistaprint’s assets. In such an event, we will update this policy to reflect any change in ownership or control of your personal information.
