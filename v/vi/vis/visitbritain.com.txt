3.3 Forums
Each time you create or reply to a post or thread on a website forum from us, in addition to providing this forum service, we may also record the forum name and the time and date of your post or thread with your account details. We do this to better understand the ‘typical users’ of our forums and to select or tailor our marketing communications to reflect your forum activity. We do not use the actual content of your forum posts or threads for purposes of sending marketing communications.
4. Sharing your personal information
We may have to share your personal data with the third parties set out below for the purposes set out in the table in paragraph 3 above.
