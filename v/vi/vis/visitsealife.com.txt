This policy sets out our policy in relation to any personal information which you supply to us through your use of this website...

How we collect data, and what we do with it
You are in control of what information we collect about you. By submitting your information you consent to the use of that information as set out in this policy. However, if you choose not to share your information some areas of the web site may not be accessible or useable. We may ask you for information about yourself when you purchase tickets or other products or services, when you enter competitions or register for promotions or when you request brochures or other information. We may also invite you to complete surveys or provide us with feedback. We and our appointed advertising company also collect anonymous information about your use of the web site from cookies and by the use of pixel tags. We may match information gathered from these sources with any information you have given us about yourself for the purposes explained in this policy.
Administration and non-marketing use disclosure
We will use the information you enter at the site for administration purposes and any other purposes made clear in the data entry forms themselves, in any relevant terms or conditions and on any pages or emails which link to such forms. We may conduct analysis of user traffic. We may also disclose your personal information to third parties:
1. in the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets
2. if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our terms and conditions of use or terms and conditions of supply and other agreements, or to protect the rights, property or safety of The Merlin Entertainments Group, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purpose of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
Direct Marketing
If you book a ticket from us, the data you give us about yourself, will enable us to give you updates other than through our web site, using the contact details you provide, on promotions and services we think may interest you or to involve you in market research. To improve our picture of your interests we may link the data you give us with any data we have gathered (via cookies) about your use of the site. In some cases we may also wish to share your data with other parts of the Tussauds group or third party entities that process personal information on our behalf so that they can update you on promotions and services they think may be of interest to you.
Whenever we ask you for information about yourself, if you have indicated that you wish to receive direct marketing material from us and/or from third parties, your personal details will be included in a database compiled for direct marketing purposes and from time to time, you may receive these marketing communications. This will enable us to keep you informed about offers and events run by various attractions across the Merlin Entertainments Group, including Alton Towers Resort, THORPE PARK, Warwick Castle, Madame Tussauds, The EDF Energy London Eye and SEA LIFE.
If you have indicated that you wish to receive direct marketing material or e-mail updates from us, and/or from third parties but subsequently change your mind, you should notify us at merlin@acxiom.com. As soon after this as is reasonably practicable, we will remove your name from the relevant database. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that your data is used by third parties in accordance with this policy.
