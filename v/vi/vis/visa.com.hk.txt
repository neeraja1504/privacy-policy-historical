Privacy Matters
Revised April 2001
Depending on what you do when you visit any web site, you are providing information about your visit to the site's owners. This includes Visa-Asia.com. We value privacy and think you do too, so we want you to have the information you need to make your own decisions about your personal privacy. When you visit or supply information to any web site, we think it's a good idea for you to first understand what that site's privacy policies are. If the site doesn't tell you, don't hesitate to ask.
The bottom line at www.visa-asia.com is that we use the information that we get from your visit for internal tracking purposes, to make Visa-Asia.com as useful and interesting to you as we can, and to respond to your requests for information or other services. Except as specifically noted, we do not use your personal information for any other purpose; we never sell it to any third party; and, we never share it with any third party.

Visitor Registration or Requests for Information:
Visa-Asia.com only collects personal information that you choose to provide voluntarily when using or registering with the Visa-Asia.com site. "Personal information" includes information that can identify you as a specific individual, such as your name or email address; and, in the case of license agreements, your name and company name. While you can browse our site without registering, you will need to register in order to take advantage of certain features, such as requesting updates on promotional offers.
Visa-Asia.com will on occasion ask you to voluntarily submit information about other people.

Visa-Asia.com may use this information to inform them about a sweepstakes or contest.
Browsing and the use of Cookies:
Visa-Asia.com uses cookie technology as part of our web site's statistical reporting. A cookie is a small piece of information sent by a website that is saved on your hard disk by your computer's browser. It holds information a site may need to personalize your experience (i.e., rotating images on Visa-Asia.com home page) and to gather web site statistical data, such as which pages are visited, what is downloaded, the internet provider's domain name and country that our visitors come from (e.g. 'aol.com,' or 'umich.edu') and the addresses of sites visited immediately before, and after, coming to Visa-Asia.com. However, none of this is associated with you as an individual. It is measured only in aggregate. The information in the cookies lets us trace your "click stream" activity (i.e., the paths taken by visitors to our site as they move from page to page. Cookies do not capture your individual email address or any private information about you.
We also use standard web server log files to help us count visitors and evaluate our site's technical capacity. We use this information to find out how many people visit Visa-Asia.com, help us arrange the pages in the most user-friendly way, keep the site browser-friendly, and to make our pages more useful to our visitors. We record information on site traffic but not information on individual visitors to our site, so no information about you in particular will be kept or used.
To browse without cookies, you can configure your browser to reject all cookies, or to notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.)

From time to time, Visa-Asia.com may conduct sweepstakes, trivia games, or surveys via our web site.

Except where necessary to run a sweepstakes, we will never permanently record or report any response you give on its own or connect it to your name or address. We will hold these responses only as anonymous statistics. We will never sell or rent such information to any third parties.
Email, Mailing Lists, and Other Services:
When you send us an email, we use your email address to thank you for your comment and/or reply to your question, and we will store your communication and our reply in case we correspond further. Beyond our initial reply, we will never use your email address to send you any unsolicited message or information, nor will we share it with or sell it to anyone else for such use.
When you request information or other services, we use your email address and any other information you give us to provide you with the information or other services you requested until you ask us to stop (using the 'unsubscribe' instructions provided with each email and/or on the site where you signed up and/or as we otherwise provide), or until the information or service is no longer available. We will not use your address or other information to provide you with any unsolicited message or information (unless that is part of the service you are requesting), nor will we share it with or sell, rent or lease it to any third party for such use.
