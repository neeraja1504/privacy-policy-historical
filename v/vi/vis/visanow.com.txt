HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION
Data Security
We have implemented measures designed to secure Personal Information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. Additional details about the specific technologies used to secure Personal Information are available upon request by sending an email to privacy@envoyglobal.com.
The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Platform, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee the security of your Personal Information transmitted to our Platform.
We operate the Platform and manage the provision of the Support Services from the United States. If you are located outside of the United States, please be aware that information we collect will be transferred to and processed in the United States. By using the Platform, or providing us with any information, you fully understand and unambiguously consent to this transfer, processing and storage of your information in the United States, a jurisdiction in which the privacy laws may not be as comprehensive as those in the country where you reside and/or are a citizen.
PRIVACY SHIELD
Envoy has certified certain of our services, for which we act as a data processor, under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework (the “Privacy Shield”).
Envoy’s participation in the Privacy Shield applies to Personal Information processed on behalf of Employers where such Personal Data is received from the European Union. This may include human resources data (as relevant to the immigration matters we are handling on behalf of Employers). Envoy is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
Envoy complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Information from European Union member countries transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield.  Envoy has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to such data. If there is any conflict between the policies in this privacy policy and data subject rights under the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/.
Pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks, EU individuals have the right to obtain our confirmation of whether we maintain Personal Information relating to you in the United States.  Upon request, we will provide you with access to the Personal Information that we hold about you.  You may also correct, amend, or delete the Personal Information we hold about you.  An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data transferred to the United States under Privacy Shield, should direct their query to privacy@envoyglobal.com.  If requested to remove data, we will respond within a reasonable timeframe.
We will provide an individual opt-out choice, or opt-in for sensitive data, before we share your Personal Information with third parties other than our agents, or before we use it for a purpose other than which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized.  To request to limit the use and disclosure of your personal information, please submit a written request to privacy@envoyglobal.com.
Envoy’s accountability for Personal Information that it receives in the United States under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to a third party is described in the Privacy Shield Principles. In particular, Envoy remains responsible and liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if third-party agents that it engages to process the Personal Information on its behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, unless Envoy proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Envoy commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield. European Union individuals with Privacy Shield inquiries or complaints should first contact Envoy by email at privacy@envoyglobal.com.
Envoy has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the Privacy Shield Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD, operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers  for more information and to file a complaint. This service is provided free of charge to you.
If your complaint involves human resources data transferred to the United States from the EU in the context of the employment relationship, and Envoy does not address it satisfactorily, Envoy commits to cooperate with the panel established by the EU data protection authorities (“ DPA Panel ”), as applicable and to comply with the advice given by the DPA Panel, as applicable with regard to such human resources data.  To pursue an unresolved human resources complaint, you should contact the state or national data protection or labor authority in the appropriate jurisdiction.  Complaints related to human resources data should not be addressed to the BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD.
Contact details for the EU data protection authorities can be found at http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm
If your Privacy Shield complaint cannot be resolved through the above channels, under certain conditions, you may invoke binding arbitration for some residual claims not resolved by other redress mechanisms.  See Privacy Shield Annex 1 at https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-introduction
