Community Privacy policy | Vivaldi Browser
General
At Vivaldi Technologies AS (“Vivaldi”), protecting your privacy is one of our top priorities. We strictly protect the security of your personal information within Vivaldi’s Community Services (mail, blogs, forum and sync).
We do not share or sell your personal data with any third party. We protect user data from disclosure, with exceptions only requested by law or court order.
The purpose of this policy is to inform you of how Vivaldi will process your personal data as data controllers and the measures and processes we have put in place to ensure its adequate protection. Providing this kind of information is also one of the requirements under the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”).
Types of data we collect and for what purposes
When you visit Vivaldi’s websites, we collect some visitor statistics. The visitor statistics include information about the visitor’s truncated IP-address, usage patterns, the point in time the visitor visits our websites on Vivaldi.net and Vivaldi.com and information about the browser and operating system the visitor uses.
This information is collected solely for statistical purpose and is not used to identify individuals. We use these statistics to improve and optimize usability of our products and services for our users. These statistics help us determine where we need to improve and prioritize our resources. The legal basis for the processing is the legitimate interest Vivaldi has in providing you with a good experience when visiting the websites.
Vivaldi’s websites use cookies. A cookie is a tiny data file that resides on your computer, mobile phone or another device, and allows us to recognize you as a visitor when you return to the website using the same computer and web browser. This allows us to provide more customized experience to our visitors. The legal basis for the processing is the legitimate interest Vivaldi has in providing you with a good experience when visiting the websites. You can remove or block cookies using the settings in your browser.
We keep the contact information you provide in your account profile. We use this contact information in case of lost passwords, username recovery, account confirmation, or other account-related support work. We also use this contact information to keep you updated about any technical development in our browser and services and, if you have decided so, send you our newsletter.
You can unsubscribe from any of our communications at any time by clicking on “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of each email or visit https://vivaldi.com/newsletter/unsubscribe. The legal basis for the processing is the fulfillment of your request (contract) and the legitimate interest Vivaldi has in providing you with updates and newsletters pertaining the services.
In order to provide our forum service and identify possible account abuse, we collect your email address, hashed IP address, profile picture, posts and topics, and the history of changes. We do not have access to your private chats. Vivaldi forum uses a modified version of the Akismet plugin to mitigate spam. The plugin has been modified so that the only information sent back to Akismet is username and comment content, excluding personal data like IP and email address as the default install would require. The legal basis for the processing is the legitimate interest Vivaldi has in providing you with a good experience when using our forum service.
In order to provide you our mail service we process the following email metadata: sender and recipient email addresses, the IP address from which incoming messages originated, and message sent and received times. Email messages are scanned by automated systems that allow us to detect malicious activity. The legal basis for the processing is the fulfillment of your request (contract) and the legitimate interest Vivaldi has in providing you with a good experience when using our email service.
If you use Vivaldi Sync feature, the documentation about the data we collect and for what purposes for this service is available here. The legal basis for the processing is the legitimate interest Vivaldi has in providing you with a good experience when using our Sync feature.
