E-mail communications
E-mail is not necessarily secure against all forms of interception. If your communication includes sensitive information about you and you would prefer not to transmit this information in this fashion, please contact us by mail or telephone rather than e-mail. We collect only those e-mail addresses that are volunteered by the visitor, through e-mail messages addressed to our company or its employees, or through visitor responses via the “contact us” portion of the Site, e-mail marketing destination web pages and public events. We use the lists of e-mail addresses for marketing purposes and to inform those interested in our products about events, products, services or other items of interest. We may also use the lists of e-mail addresses volunteered by our visitors to register the visitor for an extranet account or to process orders for brochures and other written materials. You may opt-out of receiving the promotional or marketing e-mails at any time by notifying us as a reply to any unwanted e-mail, or by writing to Vivint Solar at 1800 W. Ashton Boulevard, Lehi, Utah 84043. This opt-out procedure will not be available for e-mails that are necessary to provide confirmation of a completed transaction (such as a purchase, service request or change in the visitor’s user profile) or for e-mails that confirm a visitor's status as a registered user of the Vivint Solar customer extranet.
Other personal information
We may use a mailing address or phone number that a visitor provides for a variety of Vivint Solar related reasons. We may send periodic mailings to visitors or make telephone calls to inform those visitors who have provided a mailing address or telephone number of new products, services or events. We may also share such information with our affiliates, such as Vivint, Inc. If you do not wish to receive such calls or mailings, you may request to be removed from the contact list by contacting Vivint Solar at support@vivintsolar.com or by telephone 877.404.4129. Additionally, you may make your request by writing to Vivint Solar at 1800 W. Ashton Boulevard, Lehi, Utah 84043.
