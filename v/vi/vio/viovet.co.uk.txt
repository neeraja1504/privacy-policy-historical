In order to dispatch your order, we will pass only the necessary data to the appropriate carrier for delivery & tracking;
provide customer support services to you;
provide you with an up to date, efficient, and reliable service;
help prevent fraud (e.g. we may check payment card details with our credit agency, who may keep a record of that information, and reserve the right to refuse orders on that basis. Your credit rating can be checked for a nominal fee with the main UK agencies Equifax and Experian);
verify your prescription or pet data, in the event you are purchasing restricted products such as prescription veterinary medicines or products sold under POMV license.

DATA SECURITY
We use the latest security measures to protect your details when you shop with us. We use 128-bit TLS (the successor to SSL) to encrypt all data sent from you to us and us to you. This protects your personal, card and other data from being read by others in transit. Our servers also refuse to accept connections using older versions of SSL which are no longer considered secure if a client tries to use them, so you know your connection is secure.
Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.
We will engage selected system support partners from time to time as required in order to support and maintain our website’s security and integrity of data. Data may be transferred as required to fulfil the purpose of the engagement. For example, we currently use Sentry to improve data integrity and Cloudflare for additional data security.
WHO ELSE MAY SEE YOUR DATA
