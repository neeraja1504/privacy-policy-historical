The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser, however please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website. Our website uses Google Analytics including the functions of Universal Analytics. Universal Analytics allows the activities on our website to be analyzed across devices (e.g., accessing it on a laptop and later on a tablet). This happens by assigning a pseudonym user ID to a user. However, no person-related data is shared with Google. Even when Universal Analytics adds additional Google Analytics functions, this does not mean that protection of privacy is reduced. By using this website, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner and for the purposes set out above.
In the event that you wish to avoid disclosure of any personal data, which could be shared through the tracing service of Google Inc. you are advised to make use of the deactivation-add-on as supplied by Google under “http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en". Additionally, you are also entitled to withdraw any pseudonym user profiles at any time for future effect, should these have been created.
Also, you can exercise your general right to object to the use of your data for advertising purposes at any time with effect for the future. In view of the discussion on the use of analytical tools with complete IP addresses, we would like to point out that this website uses Google Analytics with the extension "_anonymizeIp()" so that IP addresses are only processed further in abbreviated form to prevent them being linked directly.
We also use the technical extension "Google Signals", which enables cross-device tracking. This makes it possible to assign an individual website visitor to different end devices. However, this only happens if the visitor has logged in to a Google service when visiting a website and has activated the option "personalized advertising" in his Google account settings at the same time. Even then, however, no personal data or user profiles are accessible to us; they remain anonymous to us.
If you do not want "Google Signals" to be used, you can disable the "Personalized advertising" option in your Google Account preferences.
