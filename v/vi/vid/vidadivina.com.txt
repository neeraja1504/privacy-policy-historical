Vida Divina® Privacy Policy
OUR COMMITMENT TO PRIVACY
Our Privacy Policy has been developed as an extension of our commitment to combine quality products
and services with integrity in dealing with users. The Policy is designed to assist you in the understanding
of how we collect, use and protect the personal information provided to us.
THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT
When you visit our site, we collect two types of information: personal information you actively choose to
disclose (“Active Information”) and information not visible to you that arises out of your browsing of our
site (“Passive Information”). Please note that passive Information is collected on an aggregate and
anonymous basis.
Personally Identifiable Information
Personally Identifiable Information is information that identifies and is reasonably linked to you.
Registration
When you register to become an authorized reseller of our products or services, we will collect Personally
Identifiable Information (such as name, address, email address, and telephone number). This Personally
Identifiable Information is securely stored and may be accessed on our website. You are assigned an
identification number and select your own password – both are needed to enter the Site and to access
your Contact Information. Please safeguard your password in a secure location as we are not responsible
for breaches into the system when access is willingly provided.
Ordering
When you place an order for products or services, we collect Personally Identifiable Information (such as
name, contact and billing information, credit card, and other transactional information). We use this
information to deliver your order, process payment, and to communicate the status of your order.
Credit and Debit Card Storage
Credit and debit card information collected at registration or for product orders is used only to process
payment for the transaction and, generally, is not retained on our Site. However, you may voluntarily elect
to securely store multiple credit cards to be used for product orders.
Surveys and Promotions
Occasionally, you may voluntarily provide Personally Identifiable Information to complete surveys and
questionnaires or to participate in user polls. We use this information to improve our products and

services and to ensure that we’re providing accurate disclosures. We may also use your Personally
Identifiable Information to provide you newsletters and other marketing information that coincide with your
preferences. You may customize your marketing preferences, or let us know if you do not wish to receive
any promotional materials, by adjusting your Subscriptions & Email options on the Site.
Active Information You Choose to Provide
In order to gain use of the site (become a “user”), we require you to disclose the following information:
Name, Address and Phone Number
We use secure socket layer (SSL) encryption to protect the transmission of the information you submit to
us when you use our secure online forms. The information you provide to us is stored securely.
Passive Information
We store and collect various types of passive information on an aggregate and anonymous basis. This
information may include such technical information as it pertains to your Internet protocol address, your
device operating system and browser type, cookies, and an address of a referring website or any other
path you take to reach our website all described in greater detail below.
Aggregate Information
This refers to information that does not, by itself, identify you as a specific individual. Such information
would include the Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”) of the website that referred you to our Site, your
Internet Protocol (“IP”) address (a number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you surf
the web), your operating system and browser type, and any search terms that you enter on our Site. Our
web server aggregates this information in order to monitor the level of activity on our Site, evaluate its
effectiveness, and improve the content or our Site in order to make your visit an easy and enjoyable
experience.
We may collect, compile, store, publish, promote, report, or otherwise disclose or use any Aggregate
Information, provided that such information does not personally identify you. We do not correlate any
Personally Identifiable Information with the Aggregate Information that we collect on our Site. If we do
correlate any Aggregate Information to you, it will be protected like any other Personally Identifiable
Information under this Privacy Statement.
What is a Cookie?
Cookies are a feature of web browser software that allows web servers to recognize the computer used to
access a site. They are small pieces of data stored by a user’s browser to simplify subsequent
interactions with the site. This makes it easier for a user to move from site to site and to complete
transactions over the Internet. Cookies should make your online experience easier and more
personalized. Our site utilizes cookies to collect information about how our site is used. Passive
Information gathered may include the date and time of visits, the site pages viewed, time spent at our site,
the sites visited just before and just after visiting our site. If you do not wish to transmit “cookie”
information about yourself, you may turn off the cookie function in your web browser.

Our site’s servers also automatically identify your computer by its Internet Protocol address, which is a
unique string of numbers that are assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider. The IP
address may be used to address problems with our server or to gather broad demographic information
about our users. We passively collect your IP Address.
HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION COLLECTED
Broadly speaking, persons we employ directly, or as contractors or agents at our direction, use Active
Information for purposes of administering our core business functions, such as the fulfillment of orders or
services, the furnishing of customer care and support, and supplying the availability of other products or
services we think might be of interest to our users.
We use Passive Information to gather information about our users and to enhance our site to make it
easier, faster and friendlier for users. Additionally, cookies help us better understand the usage pattern of
the people that visit our site, which helps us improve our services. Passive Information may result in your
viewing of particular advertising based on your user habits.
We reserve the right to use Active and Passive Information in order to prevent, detect and investigate
fraud, security breaches, or any other potentially prohibited or illegal activity.
We may use any Active Information or Passive Information provided to contact you about various
changes to our site, new services, features or products we offer. If at any time you do not wish to receive
such information, you may “opt-out” of doing so by adjusting your email settings in the back office of the
website.
Your Information Relating to Hyperlinks
You might be able to access other websites through our site via hyperlinks. When you do so, you are
subjecting yourself to their privacy policies and data collection. Please read the privacy policies of those
sites to ensure you agree with the terms before using such sites.
Receiving and Sharing of Information from and with Third Parties
We reserve the right to receive information about you from other third party sources, that help us update,
expand and analyze our records and identify new customers.
Furthermore, we may share Personal Information necessary to the prevention of fraud, illegal activities,
and security breaches. Because of this, it’s possible some of your
personal information may be shared with fraud prevention agencies. If false or inaccurate information is
provided and fraud is identified, details of this fraud may be passed on to these agencies. Likewise, law
enforcement and governmental agencies may access and use certain information pursuant to any law,
regulation, or subpoena. This applies to information as it relates to both open and closed accounts.

Additionally, third parties who perform services for us as it relates to security, payment, etc. (such as
Internet Service Providers, credit card processors, and merchant banks) may also have access to your
information in the performance of such necessary services.
Finally, we may disclose anonymous information about user habits to third party advertisers on our site.
Should we buy or sell assets of our company, another company may need to review our company’s
assets, which might include your information, to make business decisions as to whether to acquire such
assets.
HOW WE SECURE ACTIVE AND PASSIVE INFORMATION
We secure your personal information submitted by you by using reasonable efforts to prevent
unauthorized access or disclosure, or accidental loss of Active and Passive Information. Individual
postings on this site and other communications to our office via email or standard mail may not be secure
unless we advise you that security measures are in place prior to your submission of information.
Therefore, if you choose to communicate with us through these means, you are assuming the risk of
doing so and we respectfully request that you do not send or post sensitive information through these
means.
Accessing and Correcting Your Information
We take reasonable measures to ensure that any Personally Identifiable Information we collect on our
Site is accurate, current, complete, and reliable for its intended use. If you wish to update or otherwise
correct Personally Identifiable Information provided to us, you may edit your information online.

Information provided from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access. We employ physical, electronic, and
managerial processes to safeguard and secure your information.
It is your responsibility to safeguard the password you use to access our Site and to promptly advise us if
you ever suspect that your password has been compromised. We strongly encourage you to change your
