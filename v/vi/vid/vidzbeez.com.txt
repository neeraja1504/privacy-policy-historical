Cookies Policy
Last modified on 19 June 2014
When visiting the Site, we send “cookies” to your device. Cookies are small files of code, usually stored on a user's computer or device, which enable a website to "personalize" itself for each user and remember his preferences. Most websites that you visit today will use cookies in one way or another in order to improve your user experience. Similarly, we have placed cookies on your computer to improve your experience using iSpeed.club. You can change your cookie settings at any time, but otherwise, we will assume you are OK to continue.
What is a Cookie?
Cookies are text strings of information that are downloaded to your computer or device when you are using iSpeed.club. Your web browser then sends these cookies back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognizes those cookies. You can find more information about cookies at www.allaboutcookies.org.
Cookies are very helpful and can be used for various different purposes. These purposes include allowing you to navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and making the interaction between you and the Site quicker and easier. Cookies are also used to help ensure that the advertisements you see are relevant to you and your interests.
Different Types of Cookies
There are four main types of cookie we use:
Strictly necessary cookies: These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around and use the features of a website, or to provide a service requested by you. We do not need to obtain your consent in order to use these cookies. ****
Functionality cookies: These cookies allow the Site to remember choices you make (such as your account name, language or the region you are in) and provide more personal and enhanced features.  For instance, a website may be able to provide you with more localized information or products by using a cookie to store information about the region in which you are currently located, remember changes you have made to text or view size, and other parts of web pages that you can customize, and provide services you have asked for.
Performance cookies: These cookies collect information about how you use the Site, for instance which pages you go to most often, and if you get error messages from them. These cookies don’t collect information that identifies you. All of the information collected by these cookies is aggregated and therefore anonymous. It is only used to improve how the Site works.
Targeting cookies or advertising cookies: These cookies are used to deliver adverts that are more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign. They are usually placed by advertising networks with the permission of a website’s operator. They remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with other organizations such as advertisers. Quite often targeting or advertising cookies will be linked to site functionality provided by the other organization. For more information about online behavioral advertising cookies and online privacy, please see the guide produced by the internet advertising industry available at www.youronlinechoices.com.
