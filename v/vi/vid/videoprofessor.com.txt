What Information Does Video Professor or Third Parties Collect?
When you visit our web sites (including www.videoprofessor.com, www.videoprofessoronline.com, www.johnwscherer.com, www.freecomputerlearning.com and any other sites that may be owned or operated by Video Professor or by third parties contracted by Video Professor (Video Professor web sites)), contact us by phone, letter, or e-mail, or order products from us, we may collect your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number(s), products ordered, your computer’s IP addresses, browser type, and financial information (credit/debit card number). We use this information to complete your order, but we also use the information to send you offers about other products that may interest you, to follow up with you regarding your experience with us and to track traffic on the Video Professor web site(s). We also collect any data that you enter into online forms on Video Professor web sites, whether or not you complete a transaction. This data belongs to Video Professor and may be used to send you offers about other products that may interest you, to follow up with you regarding your experience with us, or for any other marketing purpose consistent with this Privacy Policy. The information Video Professor collects is not tied to any of your personal information. We also have business affiliates that we exchange your information with, so that they can also offer you products or services. In some cases on our web sites, by entering information on the web page, you are giving permission to Video Professor to pass your information, including payment information, to our business affiliates. Please be aware that Video Professor is not responsible for your data after it is provided to any third party. We also store your information as your user profile. We collect the information using cookies, log files, clear GIFs, and through our business affiliates. A session cookie is deleted from your computer as soon as you close your web browser. A persistent cookie is stored on your computer, and it allows you quicker access to our web sites, and also helps Video Professor track and target your Internet interests so we can send you relevant offers. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions at http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=KB;EN-US;q278835 for Internet Explorer® and https://hdc.tamu.edu/reference/documentation/index.php?section_id=794 for Netscape®. We also use the information in the aggregate, which means we can’t identify any one person, but we can see what the habits and trends are for people who do use our web site.
Third-party Cookies
Some third parties may use cookies on our web sites, so they can track orders placed, and deliver relevant offers to you to optimize your experience with us. We don’t have any control or access to the third-party cookies, and we cannot limit their use of the information collected.
These third-party cookies may gather non-personally identifiable information at one web site and use that information to direct ad content at another site. Many of these third-party ad networks belong to the National Advertising Initiative (NAI). The NAI has released a set of self-regulatory principles, which includes mandating an opt-out mechanism for the targeted ad programs their members provide. To acquire more information about the NAI principles and to opt out of receiving NAI member advertisements, please visit: http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp
Specifically, Video Professor has partnered with aCerno, Inc. for its third-party advertisements. aCerno’s Privacy Policy can be found at http://acerno.com/privacy.html
PLEASE NOTE: If you erase or otherwise alter your browser’s cookie file (including upgrading certain browsers) you may need to perform any opt-out procedure again.
How is the Information Used?
When you place an order with Video Professor, we use the personal information we collected as explained above, to process and review your order as well as to personalize Video Professor mailings to you based on your perceived interests. These mailings are typically sent through the mail or through e-mail and may include special offers, newsletters, and commercial offerings that may interest you. This information may be combined with offers and/or news from other third parties. In addition to the possible mailings and e-mail messages listed above, Video Professor sends all new online customers a welcoming e-mail to verify their order. Moreover, if a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as name, zip/postal code, and e-mail address.
For customers who place orders from within the U.S., we may also share your information with an outside shipping company to ship your order and a credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services. These companies will not retain, share, store, or use your personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.
From time to time, we may also partner with third parties to provide specific services to you. After you purchase from us, you may be offered other services such as magazine subscriptions. If you sign up for these additional services, we share your name, billing, and other contact information, such as your address and/or phone number, which is necessary for the third party to provide these additional services to you. These third parties are not permitted to use any of the personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.
We also link to co-branded web sites that are maintained by Video Professor and one or more of our business partners. When you submit information to one of our co-branded sites you may be submitting it to both Video Professor and our business partners and the privacy policies of these co-branded sites may differ from this privacy policy. We encourage you to read the privacy policies on any co-branded site to which you link for information on the privacy practices of that site.
We may also purchase third-party marketing data and add it to our existing user database to provide pertinent offers we think our users would be interested in. We use this information to enhance or overlay the profile of individual users. This marketing data is therefore tied to the users’ personally identifiable information.
We may share the information we collect from you with third parties, including our business partners. For example, we may pass your e-mail, name, and/or other personal information to a third party that we feel may have products or services which may be of interest to you.
We periodically remove from personal information data that can be used to identify individuals, for example by summarizing, aggregating, or removing certain data elements. The resulting cleaned data is no longer considered personal information and is not subject to this Privacy Policy. The cleaned data may be published by Video Professor and provided to various third parties.
This Privacy Policy does not control third parties’ use of your personal information.
Finally, we may need to disclose your personal information when required by law or we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a court proceeding, a court order, or legal process served on Video Professor.
Is My Information Secure?
When you submit sensitive information via telephone or through any of the Video Professor web sites, your information is protected both on and offline. We use SSL (secure sockets layer) to encrypt any sensitive information, such as credit card numbers, that you submit using an online registration/order form. To learn more about SSL, follow this link: http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/S/SSL.html.
While we use SSL encryption to protect your sensitive information online, we also take great care to protect your sensitive information that is in our offices. Only those employees who need your information to perform a specific job (such as billing clerks or customer service representatives) are granted access to your personally identifying information. Further, all employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices and periodic reminders are given to all employees on the importance of protecting the privacy of our users. Finally, the computer servers on which your personally identifiable information is stored are in a securely locked facility.
Do I Have a Choice in the Collection and Use of My Information?
While some of the information we collect is done automatically upon your visiting of our web sites and your purchasing of products, information such as that disclosed by you in your participation of Video Professor contests or surveys is completely voluntary. If you would prefer we not collect this information, simply refrain from participating in the survey or contest. Moreover, you have the opportunity to opt out of having your information used for purposes not directly related to the Video Professor web sites. If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt out of receiving these communications by going to http://www.videoprofessor.com/unsubscribe.html and entering your e-mail address. Alternatively, you may contact us at 1-800-525-7763, or via postal mail: P.O. Box 150741, Lakewood, CO 80215, ATTN: Remove to Opt Out. After submitting your opt-out request, we will remove your e-mail address from our database within ten (10) days.
Any information you provide will be transferred to the United States. You authorize this transfer by visiting our sites and submitting information.
Video Professor’s web sites may contain links to other sites and we will, on occasion, create business relationships with third-party companies, including, without limitation, situations where we host their content, or vice versa. Please be aware that we, Video Professor, are not responsible for the privacy practices of other such sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our sites and to read the privacy statements of each and every site that collects personally identifiable information.
