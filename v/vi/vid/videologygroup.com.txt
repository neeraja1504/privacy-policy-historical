What this privacy policy covers
This policy covers how Videology, acting as data controller, treats information that Videology collects and receives through our services, which include Videology’s digital media advertising and ad targeting solutions and any other technology, products and/or services offered by Videology (collectively referred to as the “Services”), including your past use of, or interaction with, the Services.  For more information about our Services, please click here.
This policy does not apply to information about you collected by third party advertisers and publishers who use Videology’s Services, or other third parties linked to or otherwise accessible via the Services.  The information collected or received by any such providers and third parties is subject to their own privacy policies.
Collection and Use of Information
Personal Information
Videology offers its Services to other commercial businesses, not consumers.  Videology does not require consumers to provide personal information when viewing or interacting with ads received through our customers’ use of the Services.  Personal information is information relating to you, such as name, street address and email address collected by Videology or otherwise received by Videology.  However, on some pages of Videology’s corporate web site, you may choose to provide personal information to Videology for a specific purpose, such as when submitting a request for information, submitting a specific question to Videology about our Services or related to your privacy, or requesting that Videology contact you.  Additionally, if you enter into a business relationship with Videology, we may require that you provide us with personal information for administrative purposes, such as maintaining account information, preparing invoices and issuing payment.  If you do provide us with personal information, your information shall only be used for the purpose for which it is submitted.
Videology receives IP addresses from most users who view ads we deliver because, in most cases, this information is automatically sent to us by the software on the Internet-connected device (e.g., Microsoft Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, apps on mobile and other connected devices such as smart TVs and gaming consoles) of those users each time we receive an ad request from a media supplier (e.g., web sites  and app providers on mobile devices, smart/connected TVs and gaming consoles) to deliver an ad to the media on the device which the users are viewing content.  We use IP address in the following ways:
To assist us with both delivering the ad and selecting the most appropriate advertising based on geographic area, publicly available census-based data and other aggregated information about groups of people who live in particular geographic areas, and other information derived from the IP address of the web browser from whom we received an ad request, such as ISP provider.
To identify “households” for purposes of delivering targeted advertising based on behavioral/interest-based categories associated with such households. IP addresses are assigned by your Internet service provider (e.g., Comcast/Xfinity, AT&T, Cox Communications, Time Warner Cable, etc.) to the modem used to access the Internet for connected devices in your home and/or business. Any devices using the modem to access the Internet may broadcast the same IP address which (as noted above) is automatically sent to us by your connected device when we receive an ad request from a media supplier. At home, connected devices could include one or more laptop/desktop computers, tablets, mobile phones, smart/connected TVs and gaming consoles. At work, connected devices could include one (or all) floor(s) in an office building. If you opt-out of Videology’s interest-based advertising on a device by completing our opt-out process ( See “Access To and Choices About Your Information – Opting Out and Reviewing Your Ad Preferences“ below), provided you do not remove or delete our opt-out cookie, we will no longer use your IP address to identify your household on the browser of the device that requested the opt-out for purposes of delivering targeting advertising based on behavioral/interest-based categories.
Aggregate information derived from IP addresses, such as the number of ad impressions delivered to a geographic region, may also be reported to our advertising clients.  Finally, we may use IP address to help identify and combat potentially fraudulent activity.
Other Information related to You
When you visit a web site or view content on other Internet-enabled devices (e.g., smart/connected TV, gaming consoles, set-top boxes) that use our Services and view an ad that we’ve sent to that site or device, Videology may use cookies and other technologies (such as pixels or web beacons, if supported by the device) to record and store information about your interaction with the Services (which information, by itself, cannot be used to identify you personally), most commonly known as “click-stream data” or “impression logs”.  Click-stream data is associated with your device’s Internet browser/content delivery software (e.g., Microsoft Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome or a smart/connected TV or gaming console’s browser) and can include information such as device type (e.g., computer, tablet, smart/connected TV), date/time of visit, browser type, web pages visited when viewing an ad we’ve sent in response to an ad request we received, and information on your interaction with the Services when viewing content on your device’s Internet browser, including whether you interacted with the ad (e.g., viewed the ad to completion or clicked on the ad), and what ad content you viewed (i.e., which ad we delivered to you).  For more detailed information on cookies and web beacons, please see our FAQs.
In order to optimize the effectiveness of the Services for our clients (e.g., assist them with reaching their desired audience through targeted advertising), we use cookies and our servers to store behavioral and demographic profile data we receive from third party data providers, publishers and other partners we work with.  This data may include such things as zip code, age, gender, income range and behavioral interests (such as “sports enthusiast”, “foodie” or “travel enthusiast”), but cannot be directly tied to a specific individual and is stored in an encrypted format (e.g., random numbers, letters and symbols) within our cookies and/or on our servers.  To learn more about third data providers we work with, please click here.
In the case of mobile devices (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, etc.), some mobile inventory suppliers and third party service providers that we work with may provide us with the mobile advertising ID assigned to your device (i.e., a Google AdID for Android devices or an Apple IDFA for Apple devices) and, in some cases, additional demographic and behavioral data so that our advertising clients can use our platform technology to deliver more relevant advertising to you when you are using apps on your mobile device. Our third party service providers can also, in some instances, associate mobile advertising IDs with our cookies so that our advertising clients can use behavioral and demographic profile data associated with our cookies to deliver more relevant ads to you when you are using mobile apps on your mobile device. If you opt-out of Videology’s interest-based advertising by implementing our opt-out cookie on your browser ( See “Access To and Choices About Your Information – Opting Out and Reviewing Your Ad Preferences“ below), we will no longer associate your mobile advertising ID with our cookies. Depending on the type of mobile device you use and the options provided by the mobile operating system (“mobile OS”) on your mobile device (in many cases, Google Android or Apple iOS), you may have the option within the settings on your mobile device to choose or limit how your mobile OS uses and/or shares the mobile advertising ID associated with the mobile OS on your mobile device. We ask that mobile inventory suppliers and third party service providers we work with to only provide us with mobile advertising IDs that they have obtained the necessary rights to share with us for the purpose of delivering more relevant advertising. For more information on how to select advertising options available within the Apple iOS and Google Android, please visit our opt-out page by clicking here.
With the assistance of service providers we work with, we attempt to link user IDs (unique user IDs stored in a Videology cookie on a web browser and mobile advertising IDs stored on mobile devices) to try to identify the same user across multiple browsers and devices (such as mobile phones and tablets), a process referred to as “cross-device linking,” so that our advertising clients can attempt to reach the same consumer(s) across various devices and contexts with consistent, relevant marketing messages. As an example, if, using cross-device linking, we’ve been able to identify a user interested in “sports” who has a Videology unique cookie ID on their browser, as the same user using an app on a mobile device (based on the mobile advertising ID on their mobile phone), we may deliver related ads about sporting goods or apparel to that user on each of his/her devices, or decide not to repeat showing the user the same sports related ad on each device.
Additionally, our advertiser clients may request that we provide them with a pixel tag (sometimes referred to as a clear GIF, 1x1 pixel or web beacon) to place on their web page in order to identify Internet users, using information related to you (which, by itself, cannot be used to identify you personally), who have visited their web page so that they may target ads to those users about the advertiser’s products/services based the visitor’s interest in those products/services. If an advertiser places our pixel tag on their web page and you visit that web page, we may use cookies to identify that you visited that advertiser web page. These cookies use information related to you to build an “audience” for the advertising client that is interested in the advertiser’s products/services based on your visit and interaction on their web page. At the advertising client’s request, we may target ads for that advertiser’s products/services to you based on your prior visit to their web page. This use of data to target ads for a particular advertiser is more commonly known as “retargeting” as the advertiser is looking to retarget a user that has already shown an interest in their products/services as evidenced by the user’s visit to the advertiser’s web page.
We may also use pixel tags more generally in ads we deliver to collect information that can be used in measuring the effectiveness of our clients’ video ad campaigns (e.g., that certain ads have been viewed and/or clicked on by users with certain demographic characteristics – such as age range and gender, in certain geographic areas, on certain types of media, etc.) which is then aggregated and used to create reports for those clients on the effectiveness of their ad campaign in reaching their desired audience, along with aggregated insights about the types of consumers who responded to the particular video ad campaign.
Finally, if you visit our corporate website, we will record and store your interest in Videology as part of your interest profile which, provided you have not opted-out, may be used by us to target advertising to you about our products and services in the future.
Use and Disclosure
Videology uses information it receives and collects to customize, target, and measure the effectiveness of the ads we deliver to you via the Service (including targeted advertising based on demographic characteristics, viewing preferences and behaviors), to prevent showing you the same ads repeatedly, for reporting on campaign delivery to both advertisers and digital media inventory partners, for general reporting purposes (such as the total number of ads delivered by Videology in a given month), and to predict the characteristics and preferences of the audience on sites that use our video advertising Services in order to assist (a) advertisers in targeting their campaigns to the most relevant audience, and (b) digital media inventory providers (such as web site owners) to better understanding the make-up (types of users) who visit their site(s) so they can more effectively assist advertisers in finding the desired audience for their ad campaign(s).
Videology uses personal information you provide to us to communicate with and respond to your inquiries, to conduct research about use of the Services; to fulfill your requests for products and services; to help offer you other products, services or offerings that may be of interest to you; and to provide internal and external reporting.  Videology does not offer email marketing as part of the Services we provide to our customers, nor do we maintain email marketing lists for purposes of delivering targeted advertising to consumers via email.  If, however, you choose to provide us with personal information including your email address (generally because you’ve chosen to contact through our corporate web site or are a customer of Videology), we will not use your email address to send commercial or marketing messages without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in and, then to opt-out in the event you change your mind.  We may, however, use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of important changes to the Services or for customer service purposes).
Videology will not rent, sell or share information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies, except to provide the Services, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:
We will provide your information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Videology under confidentiality agreements.  These companies may use your personal information to help Videology fulfill a transaction you requested or communicate with you about offers from Videology and our marketing partners.  However, unless you have granted permission, these companies do not have any independent right to share or use this information for other purposes.
We work with third party vendors, partners, advertisers, publishers, demographic and behavioral data providers and other service and content providers.  In order to optimize our Services and to better target advertisements, we may share information related to you with them, including statistical and demographic data about our users and their interaction with the Services.  We will not authorize these third party providers to share or use your information other than as necessary to provide the Services and to enhance user experience through targeting of ads.
If Videology, or part(s) of Videology, is acquired or merged with another company we will transfer information about you to the acquiring company.
Finally, Videology may share information on individuals it deems necessary to comply with a subpoena or court order, to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims, or to cooperate with government and law enforcement officials.
Videology and its advertisers may use third party digital advertising and media companies, service providers and technology providers to help present advertisements to you via the Services. These third party providers may also use cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies on your device to collect click-stream data.  The use of cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies by such third-party providers is subject to their own privacy policies, not Videology's.  Please contact them directly for information about their privacy practices.  In addition, the Network Advertising Initiative, the Digital Advertising Alliance, and the IAB’s YourOnlineChoices each offer useful information about third party digital advertising and media companies, including information about how to opt-out of their information collection.
Our website may include plugins from social networks or other third parties. An example of a plugin is the link to Videology’s Twitter feed or LinkedIn page. These plugins may communicate with and send information to the party that provided the plugin, even if you do not click on the plugin. This information may include your IP address, information about your browser and device, and the address of the web page you are visiting on our site. Loading, using or clicking the plugins may also place, read and transmit cookies. These cookies may contain a unique identifier the social network or third party assigns to you for use in associating information collected about your browser, so they can deliver interest-based advertising to you. The loading, functionality and your use of the plugins are governed by the privacy policy and terms of the party that provided the plugin.
