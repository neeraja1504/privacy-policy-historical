Revised June 30, 2011
VideoETA, and its advertisers and agents are deeply committed to protecting the privacy of Internet users. Below is information outlining our continued support for the responsible management of consumer information.
For each visitor to VideoETA, our web server automatically recognizes only your Internet provider's address and the manufacturer of the web browser in use. We do not collect your email address unless you give it to us.

VideoETA, as well as most sites on the Internet, use "cookies" to enhance your experience on the web. VideoETA cannot use these cookies to personally identify you in any way. What are cookies and why do we use them? A cookie is a unique number that is provided to you the first time you visit VideoETA. This unique number, which is stored in a small file on your computer, helps VideoETA target ads to you. This cookie can help VideoETA ensure that you are not shown the same ad multiple times, and helps our advertisers understand what you like and don't like about their offerings so that they can cater better to your needs the next time you are interested in their products or services. While we believe that cookies enhance your Internet experience by limiting the number of times you see the same ad and delivering more relevant content to you, they are not required.
If you do not want the benefit of cookies, there is a simple procedure to manually delete your cookies. Please consult your web browser's Help documentation for more information.
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit VideoETA. These companies may use cookies to store information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and/or the ability to opt out of the use of these specific cookies, click here and here.
From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice. If our information practices change at some time in the future we will contact you before we use your data for these new purposes to notify you of the policy change and to provide you with the ability to opt out of these new uses, we will post the policy changes to our Web site to notify you of these changes and provide you with the ability to opt out of these new uses. If you are concerned about how your information is used, you should check back at VideoETA periodically.
Rest assured that we will never sell, exchange, share, or disclose any personal information about you.
