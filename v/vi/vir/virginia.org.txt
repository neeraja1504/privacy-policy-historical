Privacy Policy - Virginia Is For Lovers
If you feel that this company is not abiding by its posted privacy policy, contact the Virginia Tourism Office at webmaster@virginia.org.
Information Collection and Use
Virginia Tourism Corporation (VTC) collects information from our users at several different points on our website. If you choose to offer us your e-mail address, name, address, phone or comments, we store this information in a tourism database and it is available to tourism facilities. Information about contests, surveys, special offers and savings and newsletters may be sent to you from VTC and Virginia tourism partners. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see our opt-out below.
Order
We request information from the user on our order form. Here a user must provide contact information (like name and shipping address). This information is used to fill customer's orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user.
Cookies
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive on a computer, tablet, or mobile phone that collects information about the user and which may be collected from logins to third-party websites, including your general location (based on IP address and other location sources) and your interaction with advertisements and websites. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.
Log Files
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.
Content and Information Disclaimer
Content and information contained in this site has been compiled by the Virginia Tourism Corporation, based on data submitted directly from local tourism promotion agencies and business entities. While a reasonable effort is made to ensure the accuracy of this information, all data is subject to change without notice. Travelers are advised to contact individual businesses or organizations to obtain information to their satisfaction before traveling. VTC does not endorse or recommend any specific facility or organization contained in this site.
Links
This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that VTC is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Website.
Surveys & Contests
From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. During registration a user is required to give their contact information (such as name and email address). Other information requested may include contact information (shipping address and phone number), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). It is optional for the user to provide demographic information (such as income level and gender), but encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience on our site. Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. We will also share contact information with companies who partner with VTC for the contests. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.
Special Offers
VTC will occasionally send information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter to email addresses collected on the site. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see our opt-out below.
Correction/Updating Personal Information
If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us.
Opt-out
Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional materials from our partners may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to unsubscribe in the subject line in the email or email us at webmaster@virginia.org. You may also click the Unsubscribe link at the bottom of any email.
Notification of Changes
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our privacy page so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
