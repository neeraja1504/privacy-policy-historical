Information Collected
We collect personal information about you in various ways. We may also get information from other sources and may combine it with information we collect about you. Personal information is information that identifies or is associated with a specific person, such as a name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, or information about activities directly linked to that person. Personal information does not include information that is not used to identify you, including aggregate or anonymous information.
Information you give us: You may give us information in a variety of ways, including when you sign up for or use Virgin Mobile Services, communicate with customer care or register on one of our websites. For example, you may provide us information such as our name, billing address, telephone number ore-mail address. We also collect information about your demographics, activities, location and personal preferences. Third-party providers, whose sites are featured on and accessed via our website, may collect information as well. Such collection and use of your information is governed by the third party's privacy policy - not by this one.
If we have trouble processing your order, the contact information you provide is used to get in touch with you. We also use this contact information to provide you with updates regarding your current phone or service and to provide you with information about Virgin Mobile promotions and special offers.
Virgin Mobile may offer the opportunity to participate in contests, giveaways, or other similar promotions we sponsor. Except as explained otherwise in the rules for a particular contest, giveaway, or promotion, any personal information you provide will be used in accordance with this Policy.
Information we automatically collect: We automatically receive certain types of information whenever you use our Services. We may collect information about your device such as the type, version of operating system, signal strength, whether it is on and how it is functioning, as well as information about how you use the device and services available through it, such as your call and data usage and history, your location, web sites you have visited, applications purchased, downloaded or used and other similar information. We may link information we collect with personal information, such as information you give us at registration and check out. We may use systems or tools to follow your use of our Services and other applications, including using cookies, web beacons and other mechanisms, along with analysis of network and device information. For example, we allow collection by analytic service provider(s) of site click-stream and cookie data to help us track aggregate and individual use of our Services. We sometimes use cookies to enable features on our sites, such as the ability to save your shopping cart or set preferences. Advertisers and ad networks that serve ads on our sites may also use their own mechanisms, including cookies. These third party cookies or tools are governed by the privacy policies of the entities placing the ads and not by this policy.
Information from other sources: We may obtain information about you from outside sources and add it to or combine it with your account information. For example, we often receive information from the retailer from whom you purchased your Virgin Mobile phone or device prior to initiating service with us. We also may use commercially available demographic and marketing information from third parties to help us better serve you or inform you about products or services that we think will be of interest to you.

Information about our customers is one of our most important business assets, and therefore we strive to protect it and keep it confidential. We do not share information that identifies you personally with third parties other than as follows:
Affiliates. We may share personal and non-personal information with affiliated entities for approved business purposes.
Virgin Mobile USA's Service Providers. We may share personal information with third parties who perform services on our behalf.
Group Account Holders. We offer group accounts to business and government customers, family customers and other group account holders ("Group Accounts"). The account holder for Group Accounts is the entity or person that buys the service or product for its employees, family members or other authorized users. You (as the user of a device) may receive service, certain pricing, terms or other benefits through a Group Account with us. If so, we may share with that Group Account holder customer registration and other information related to your use of our services.
Third Party Verification Services. We may share limited personal information (e.g., address, phone number) with non-Virgin Mobile entities to assist with identity verification, and to prevent fraud and identity theft.
Other third parties with your consent. We may share information with other third parties with your consent. For example, you may agree to our sharing your information with other third parties to hear about their products and services. Use of the information you agree to share will be subject to those third parties' separate privacy policies.
Disclosures to Third Party Application and Service Providers. You may choose to use services and products offered by third party providers through our Services or devices such as third party applications. When you leave our network you may also use mobile roaming services provided by third parties. Your use of such services and applications may result in these third parties collecting your personal information and obtaining information from Virgin Mobile, including location information (when applicable). You may also choose to give personal information directly to third parties when using our Services. In each case, personal information you give a third party will be subject to its terms, conditions and policies - not this policy. You should review a third party's privacy policy and terms of service before providing your information or using the service.
Business Transfers. Personal information about you may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, sale of company assets or transition of service to another provider. In the unlikely event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership, personal information may also be transferred as a business asset.
Protection of Virgin Mobile and Others. We may access, monitor, use or disclose your personal information or communications to do things such as:
comply with the law or respond to lawful requests or legal process;
protect the rights or property of us, our agents, members, our customers, and others including to enforce our agreements, policies and terms of use;
respond to emergencies;
initiate, render, bill, and collect for services; or
facilitate or verify the appropriate calculation of taxes, fees, or other obligations due to a local, state, or federal government requirement; or determine eligibility for government benefits.
We may share information that is de-identified or in an aggregated form that does not directly identify you. We share de-identified or aggregate information for purposes such as to:
Conduct market or traffic flow analysis and reporting or produce or facilitate production by others of business and marketing reports to share with third parties. For example, we may aggregate customer information across a particular region and create a report showing that 10,000 subscribers from a given city visited a sports stadium. If you do not wish for us to use your information to produce de-identified and aggregated data sets in the reports we share with third parties, you may opt out at any time. See virginmobileusa.com/privacy for details. Assurance Wireless customers are not included in this program.
With your opt-in consent only, customize or personalize advertising based on information we collect about your use of your wireless device in order to provide wireless service to you. For example, we may use information about your mobile web browsing or use of mobile applications to deliver advertisements tailored to your interests, and we may share de-identified information about your use of your device with third parties so that they can tailor advertising to your interests based on that information. To participate in this program, you must opt in. See virginmobileusa.com/privacy for details on how to do so. Assurance Wireless customers are not included in this program.

Network and Information Security
We maintain a variety of physical, electronic and procedural safeguards. These safeguards help protect your personal information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. Be sure to use a strong account PIN to access your information on our websites and not one you use for other services.

Children's Privacy
Virgin Mobile does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. You should also be aware that wireless devices and services purchased for family use may be used by children under 13 without the knowledge of Virgin Mobile. If that happens, any information collected from the usage will appear to be the personal information of the actual adult subscriber and treated as such under this Policy.
If you have any questions about Virgin Mobile's policies around children's privacy, please contact Virgin Mobile Customer Care at 1-888-322-1122.
