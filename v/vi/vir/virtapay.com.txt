Website Visitors
Like most website operators, VirtaPay collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each browser request. Our purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how our visitors use our website. From time to time, VirtaPay may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of our website.
VirtaPay also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. VirtaPay does not use such information to identify our visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to our website choose to interact in ways that require VirtaPay to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that VirtaPay gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, visitors who join our email list provide an email address. In each case, VirtaPay collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction. VirtaPay does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. Visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
Aggregated Statistics
VirtaPay may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to our website. However, VirtaPay does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

Other than to our employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations, as described above, VirtaPay discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of VirtaPay, third parties, or the public at large.
