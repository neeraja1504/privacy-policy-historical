Privacy Policy | Virgin Media
At Virgin Media, we take the safeguarding of your information very seriously. One of the ways we do this is by adhering to the requirements of UK data protection legislation, and this has changed as part of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR for short) in force from 2018.
This means we’ve made some changes to our privacy policy, and we want to make sure you understand what these changes mean for you.
Before we get started, here’s a few things to keep in mind. When we talk about ‘you’ or ‘your’ we mean the person who is the account holder and has a contract with Virgin Media Limited or Virgin Mobile Telecoms Limited or Virgin Media Mobile Finance Limited.
Where we talk about Virgin Media we mean these three companies that provide our products and services that include broadband, TV, landline and mobile services and/or products.
Virgin Media will be the Controller of the information that you provide to us, and that we collect about you when you use our online services (https://www.virginmedia.com/ website and MyVM account). We’ll also collect information when we provide you with, or answer questions about, our products and services, including broadband, TV, landline, mobile. Our contact details are set out below.
This Privacy Policy gives you detailed information on when and why we collect your information, how we use it, and how we keep it secure.  Please take a moment to read it so you know what choices and rights you have about the information we may ask you for or collect about you. This policy may change from time to time so it's a good idea to come back and read through it every now and then. If there’s a significant change to the policy, we’ll let you know straight away. So, let’s get into it.
What kind of information do you collect, when and how? __ What kind of information do you collect, when and how? __

o   When someone refers you for our products and services

We’ll never keep more information from you than we need to. The types of information we collect will depend upon: (i) whether we collect the information from you or from someone else; and (ii) how / when we collect that information.
Information you give to us:
When you apply for and/or purchase our products or services, create an online account, or contact us with queries we’ll ask you to give us, where necessary, your generic details (i.e. name, surname, date of birth), your contact details (i.e. address, email, phone number), your financial details (i.e. bank account, payment method, credit card number)
When you talk to us on the phone, email, communicate via electronic messaging (such as SMS, MMS or live chat tools), write to us or visit us in our retail stores
In customer surveys from time to time, to help us provide you with improved products and services, we might ask you to fill in a questionnaire, just so you can let us know how we're doing. When sending you a questionnaire we’ll ask you to provide us with the following information: name, account number, email address, telephone number

Where we process your information on the basis of your consent, you’ve got the right to withdraw your consent at any time.  You can do this by:

Where we’ve got a legitimate interest – which is where we’ve got a good reason to process your data; e.g. situations where Virgin Media needs to process information to operate its business. However we always do this by considering the safeguards and impact to you. Processing activities based on a legitimate interest are:

We’ll not, however, use information about your use of third party applications on our TV service to personalise or tailor advertising
o   To provide you with tailored advertising, features and content.  We use the information we hold about you to tailor the adverts, content and features you receive to make them more relevant.

Where there’s a need to block unauthorised or illegitimate content

5.      The right to restrict processing

You have rights to ‘block’ or suppress further use of your information. When processing is restricted, we can still store your information, but may not use it further.
