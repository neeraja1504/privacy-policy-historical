If we do transfer information outside of the EEA, we will make sure that it is protected in the same way as if it was being used in the EEA. To do this, we will use one or more of these safeguards:
• Only transfer it to a non-EEA country with privacy laws that give the same protection as the EEA, as deemed by the European Commission
• Ensure that a contract with the recipient is in place that means they must protect it to the same standards as the EEA
• Transfer it to organisations that are part of Privacy Shield. This is a framework that sets privacy standards for data sent between the US and EU countries.
You can find out more about these safeguards on the European Commission Justice and Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) websites.
Here is a list of the services we currently use which are located outside of the EEA:
How do we use your data for marketing?
We may use your personal data to tell you about our relevant products, competitions and offers. This is what we mean when we talk about ‘marketing’. We may also use your data to help create a profile to find potential customers like you.
We will send you marketing based on what you tell us about yourself, data we collect when you use our services, and using information from third parties we work with. We use this information to get a view on what we think would interest you the most.
We will only send you marketing messages if we have either your consent or a legitimate interest. This is when we have a legitimate business or commercial reason to use your information that does not unfairly go against what is right and best for you.
You can ask us to stop sending you marketing messages by contacting us at any time by clicking unsubscribe at the bottom of any marketing email or updating your preferences in your online account.
Whatever you choose for marketing, you'll still receive service messages, such as booking confirmations and timetable changes.
