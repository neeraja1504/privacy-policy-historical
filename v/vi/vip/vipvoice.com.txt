NPD will not disclose your personally identifiable information to any third party unless you consent in advance, or for any of the following reasons:
to allow service providers (agents) retained by us to perform panel-related services on our behalf (e.g. sweepstakes program management and fulfillment). These service providers receive this information on a strictly limited, confidential basis; they are required to keep the information confidential and to use it only for the purposes of providing the services that we have asked them to perform;
to comply with law, governmental requirement or legal process;
to protect our property and legal rights, including those of our partners and customers, when we believe that they are, or are at risk of, being misappropriated, interfered with, or injured; and

In the event of the acquisition of NPD, or substantially all of its assets relating to NPD Online Research or its online survey business, the information we have collected from you will be among the acquired assets. Such information will remain subject to restrictions no less stringent than permitted under the Privacy Policy in effect at that time.

When claiming prizes, winners also complete an online affidavit, which gives NPD permission to post winners' names and state or country of residence.

To receive your reward, you may be required to submit and/or verify certain information (e.g. name and mailing address) to an independent third-party administrator, so it may provide your reward to you.
