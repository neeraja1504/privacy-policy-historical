We provide a sentiment solution, popularly known as WHAT IS YOUR REACTION? that can be easily placed anywhere on the page to help users express their sentiment towards the article they just read. It helps the publisher understand how many people felt happy, sad or angry for that article.
We also provide commenting solutions that is placed at the bottom of the article to build community engagement where users are allowed to express their opinion relating to the article by maintaining decent conversations.
