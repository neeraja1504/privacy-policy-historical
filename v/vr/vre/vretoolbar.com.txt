The VREtoolbar.com Privacy Notice describes how we treat personal information when you use VRE Toolbar.
Information we collect
The VRE Toolbar automatically sends only limited server log information to VREtoolbar.com and does not send any information about the web pages you visit (e.g., the URL). You do not need to provide any personal information in order to download and use the VRE Toolbar.
We count number of clicks for each menu item to determine which menu items are popular, and which of them are just waste of resources and should be removed or replaced. We do not associate any of the information that Toolbar sends with other personal information about you.
The VRE Toolbar contacts our servers periodically in order to obtain automatic updates to the latest version, or as part of the uninstall process.
Uses
We use log information about aggregate, non-personal Toolbar usage to improve the quality of Toolbar and other VREtoolbar.com services. This information does not include your search keywords.
More information
If you have additional questions, please contact us any time.
