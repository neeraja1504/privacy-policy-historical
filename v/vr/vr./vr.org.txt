IP Information Collection and Use Practices
* Host Virtual receives IP addresses from all users because this
information is automatically reported by your browser each time you view a
Web page.
* Your IP address is also stored in our user registration databases
when you register with Host Virtual.
* When a Host Virtual Web page is requested and viewed, that request
is logged on our servers with information including the IP address of the
computer that requested the page.
* IP addresses may be used for various purposes, including to:
o Diagnose service or technology problems reported by our users
or engineers that are associated with the IP addresses controlled by a
specific Web company or ISP.
o Send the most appropriate advertising based on geographic area
or information derived from your IP address. Many IP addresses are commonly
associated with Internet service providers, universities, or major
corporations in specific regions or localities. Aggregate information
derived from IP addresses may also be reported to advertisers.
o Estimate the total number of users visiting Host Virtual from
specific countries or regions of the world.
Cookies
A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous
unique identifier, that is sent to your browser from a Web site's
computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. Each Web site can send
its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but
(to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a Web site to access
the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by
other sites.
Choices about Cookies
* You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all
cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so
check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie
preferences.)
* If you reject all cookies, you will not be able to use Host Virtual
products or services that require you to "sign in," and you may not be
able to take full advantage of all offerings. However, many Host Virtual
products and services do not require that you accept cookies.
Host Virtual's Practices Regarding Cookies
Host Virtual uses its own cookies for a number of purposes, including to:
* Access your information when you "sign in," so that we can provide
you with customized content.
* Keep track of preferences you specify while you are using Host
Virtual's services.
* Display the most appropriate advertising banners, based on your
interests and activity on Host Virtual.
* Estimate and report our total audience size and traffic.
* Conduct research to improve Host Virtual's content and services.
* Require you to re-enter your Host Virtual password after a certain
period of time has elapsed to protect you against others accidentally
accessing your account contents.
Data Storage
Account Information
* When you register with Host Virtual or submit information to Host
Virtual, a temporary copy of that information is routinely made to prevent
accidental loss of your information through a computer malfunction or human
error.
* Host Virtual keeps your account information active in our user
registration databases in order to provide immediate access to your
personalization preferences each time you visit Host Virtual.
* If you ask Host Virtual to delete your Host Virtual account, in most
cases your account will be deactivated and then deleted from our user
registration database in approximately 90 days. This delay is necessary to
discourage users from engaging in fraudulent activity.
* Please note that any information that we have copied may remain in
back-up storage for some period of time after your deletion request. This
may be the case even though no information about your account remains in
our active user databases.
Servers
* The Host Virtual computers (called "servers") that send your Web
pages and advertising banners process and store an enormous amount of
information every day. These computer records are called "log files."
* Log files are used for analysis, research, auditing, and other
purposes, as described above. After this information has been used, it is
stored and is inaccessible. Until the information is stored, your Host
Virtual ID may remain in our active server log files.
