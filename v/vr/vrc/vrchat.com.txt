VRChat - Privacy
Effective Date: May 31, 2017
This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes the manner in which VRChat, Inc. (“VRChat”, “we,” or “us”) and our website at www.vrchat.com (our “Site”), as well as all related websites, networks, desktop or mobile clients and applications, and other services provided by us and on which a link to this Policy is displayed (collectively, together with the Site, our “Service”) collect, use, and disclose information about you. This Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the VRChat Terms of Use and End User License Agreement. By using the Service, you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of your information as described in this Policy.
Information We Collect on the Service
User-provided Information:
When you use the Service, we may collect or you may provide information about you and we may link this information with other information about you. You may provide us with information in various ways on the Service. For example, you provide us with information when you register for an account (we will collect your email address, birthday, and allow you to create a username and password), subscribe to our newsletters, use the Service, make a purchase on the Service, or send us customer service-related requests.
Cookies and Automatically Collected Information:
When you use the Service, we may send one or more cookies – small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters – to your device. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Service. Please review your web browser “Help" file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings. Please note that if you delete, or choose not to accept, cookies from the Service, you may not be able to utilize the features of the Service to their fullest potential. We may use third party cookies on our Service as well. For instance, we use Google Analytics to collect and process certain analytics data. To learn more about how Google Analytics uses your information and what choices you have, please visit www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/. VRChat does not process or respond to web browsers’ “do not track” signals or other similar transmissions that indicate a request to disable online tracking of users who use our Service.
We may also automatically record certain information from your device by using various types of technology, including “clear gifs" or “web beacons.” This automatically collected information may include your IP address or other device address or ID, web browser and/or device type, the web pages or sites that you visit just before or just after you use the Service, the pages or other content you view or otherwise interact with on the Service, and the dates and times that you visit, access, or use the Service. We also may use these technologies to collect information regarding your interaction with email messages, such as whether you opened, clicked on, or forwarded a message. This information is gathered from all users, and may be connected with other information about you.
Information Disclosed While Using the Service:
When using the Service, including participation in different “rooms” made available to users of the virtual-reality component of our Service, you may disclose to us and to other users of the Service information about you. This may occur when you engage in conversations, chats, or other user-to-user interactions. We may collect and use this information to the extent permitted by law.
Payment Information:
If you choose to access or use parts of the Service that require payments or fees, we may require you to provide financial information to us for the purpose of processing those payments. We may provide your payment information to third party payment processors who process transactions on our behalf. We may also collect and retain information relating to the transactions you conduct.
Location Information:
We may use your IP address to obtain general information about the physical location from which you are connecting to the Internet.
Third Party Web Beacons and Third Party Buttons:
We may display third-party content on the Service, including third-party advertising. Third-party content may use cookies, web beacons, or other mechanisms for obtaining data in connection with your viewing of the third party content on the Service. Additionally, we may implement third party buttons (such as Facebook “like” or “share” buttons) that may function as web beacons even when you do not interact with the button. Information collected through third-party web beacons and buttons is collected directly by these third parties, not by VRChat. Information collected by a third party in this manner is subject to that third party’s own data collection, use, and disclosure policies. Please note that privacy choices you have made on VRChat will not carry over to third party sites or services (and vice-versa).
Information from Other Sources:
We may obtain information from third parties and sources other than the Service, such as our partners and advertisers.
How We Use the Information We Collect. We use information we collect on the Service (in both individual and aggregate format) in a variety of ways in providing the Service and operating our business, including the following
We use the information that we collect on the Service to operate, maintain, enhance and provide the Service, to provide services and information that you request, to respond to comments and questions and otherwise to provide support to users, and to process and deliver entries and rewards in connection with promotions that may be offered from time to time on the Service.

We work with third party service providers who provide website, application development, hosting, payment, maintenance, and other services for us.

We may make certain aggregate or otherwise non-personal or de-identified information available to third parties for various purposes, including (i) compliance with various reporting obligations; (ii) for business or marketing purposes; or (iii) to assist such parties in understanding our users’ interests, habits, and usage patterns for certain programs, content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality available through the Service.
