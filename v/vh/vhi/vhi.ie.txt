Data Protection Statement
General Statement
The Vhi Group ("Vhi") fully respects your right to privacy and will only collect and process personal data about you in accordance with this Data Protection Statement and the requirements of the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003. For the purposes of this Data Protection Statement, "we", "our" and "us" refers to Vhi.
Collection and use of personal information
Vhi, as data controller, will keep your information confidential. The information (both personal data and sensitive personal data) which is provided to Vhi by you or by third parties on your behalf (e.g. in policy applications, claims and other correspondence) will be used within the Vhi group of companies for processing your application and claims, customer services and for the administration of any healthcare related products and services of which you and any other person on your policy avail. Data may also be used for statistical analyses and the detection and prevention of fraud.
We may share your data with trusted third parties who process data on our behalf, inside and outside of the European Economic Area. We may also share your data with other insurers to verify your cover, and with state bodies as required by law. We may also record your telephone calls for verification and training purposes.
We will seek consent or where necessary explicit consent from you to hold, use and process personal and sensitive personal data, including up to date medical diagnoses information for the purpose of undertaking investigations into, and to adjudicate on, any claims (including the length of hospital stay and the treatment received) and for the purposes of Vhi providing information in relation to products and services aimed at managing your health and wellbeing.
Where your policy covers people in addition to yourself, you are required to bring this Data Protection Statement to the attention of those people. Where you provide information in relation to those people you are confirming that they have read this Data Protection Statement, and that they consent to our processing of their personal data in accordance with its terms.
Vhi collects and analyses medical diagnoses information using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), which is a widely used standard for mortality and morbidity statistics, to assist in the development of our products and services.
Our health and wellbeing services may include:
Health screenings - customers may be invited to participate in health screenings designed to help identify health risks early.
Medical management programmes of care - designed to enable Vhi to actively manage the provision of healthcare services to ensure patients receive the right treatment in a cost effective way.
Chronic disease management - designed to detect, prevent or postpone the onset of chronic conditions with the provision of services that aim to achieve improved health outcomes and quality of life for patients.
Clinical Audit
Clinical audit is a clinically led quality improvement process that seeks to improve patient care and outcomes through the systematic review of care against explicit criteria and to act to improve care when standards are not met.
Right of Access and Amendment Rights
You have the right, subject to certain exemptions, to obtain a copy of any personal data which we hold about you (for which we may charge you a small fee) and to have inaccuracies in the information corrected. If you wish to avail of any of these rights, please write to the
