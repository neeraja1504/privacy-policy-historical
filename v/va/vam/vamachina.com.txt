3. Use of cookies
Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to an individual’s computer hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make using our Sites easier by, among other things, saving your passwords and preferences for you. These cookies are restricted for use only on our Sites, and do not transfer any personal information to any other party. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies; however, you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent.

4. Use of IP addresses
An IP address is a number that’s automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet provider whenever you’re surfing the Web. When you request pages from VAMA’s Web Site, our servers log your IP address. VAMA collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to audit the use of our Site. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that your session will be logged, but you are anonymous to us. We may exceptionally use your IP addresses in cooperation with your Internet provider to identify you if we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our Terms of Use or to protect our service, Sites, customers, or others.
5. Security
Security for all personally identifiable information is extremely important to us. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best efforts to ensure its security on our systems. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, VAMA cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.
