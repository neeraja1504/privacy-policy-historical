Web pages covered by this policy
This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the Victoria and Albert Museum's domains www.vam.ac.uk and www.museumofchildhood.org.uk and includes areas of the website where you can create an account, comment on blogs, sign up for newsletters, enter competitions and book tickets for events or exhibitions as well as information collected automatically by cookies, if enabled.
For information about your protection while making an online purchase from the online V&A Shop, please refer to the V&A Shop Privacy & Security page.
The V&A is not responsible for the privacy policy of services on third party websites (for example Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, etc). You should refer to the appropriate privacy policies of each individual third party website for further information about them and their terms.
The way we use information
You can browse the V&A sites without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself or your location. The websites collect some anonymous information about you automatically as you move through the site. We use this data to inform the development of our service (for example, we like to know which browsers most of our visitors are using). The information collected automatically in this way does not contain anything that can identify you personally. It provides data about what users do on the site, but not who they are.
Once you submit information to us you are no longer anonymous. Any personal information that you choose to give to us will be transferred and stored on secure local servers in a safe, confidential and secure environment.
We use the personal information you give us as a research tool to develop the content of the V&A's websites, to improve our understanding of our visitors and to determine better ways to serve you. We may use the information to provide you with details of the V&A's services and for this reason each screen that asks for data gives you the opportunity to opt out of receiving such information.
We use return e-mail addresses to answer e-mails we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties. We will not send your data to third parties and we will not send data to areas where an adequate data protection policy is not in place.
Use of cookies
Some sections of the V&A websites use cookies. Cookies are small, text-only strings of data which store information on the hard drive of your local computer or mobile device. Some cookies store data just for the time you are on the site. These are called session cookies and are not stored on your computer after you have left the site
These cookies do not contain any personal data about you individually. They are there to provide you with better information tailored to your individual needs. Most internet browsers are pre-set to accept cookies but if you prefer not to receive cookies, you can adjust your browser to refuse cookies, or to warn you when they are being used.
In the light of new legislation the V&A is making some changes to the websites and we provide you here with a register of the cookies which are currently deployed on our site.
When you visit V &A websites, if your browser is using the standard settings and it is accepting cookies, you are giving consent for cookies on the V&A sites to be stored on your computer. If you do not wish for this to happen, you can disable them in the settings of your browser.
This has to be done on each different browser you use. For more information about how to disable cookies in different browsers, visit Aboutcookies.org
The V&A websites works more efficiently if receipt of cookies is enabled, but it will still operate correctly if you disable cookies, although some extra enhanced features provided for you will not work. (For example the website will show you the last 4 pages you have visited on the site, but it cannot do this with out setting a cookie.)
Cookies used on V&A websites
We use Google Analytics to collect information about site usage and performance. This helps us better understand our users and their needs so that we can continue to improve the services we provide. We also use this information to report to funders such as the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. The analytics cookies collect information such as the number of visits to the site, pages visited and international traffic. This information is anonymous and cannot be used to identify you personally.
This table lists the cookies that we use, how they help you use particular services, what type of cookie they are and the websites that are setting the cookies on your computer.

Flash cookies used on V&A websites
V&A websites have a number of interactive features on older parts of the site that use Flash. This is widely used to provide games, video and other interactive content. Many web browsers will have a version of the Flash player that plays these files.Â  The Flash player can store data in a similar way to standard cookies, using a data file called a Local Shared Object.
This table lists Local Shared Objects that may be stored from within interactives on V&A websites. We have quite a number of older interactives using Flash. We are aware of a small number of local shared objects created by Flash features. These are used to make them work more easily and are listed below.Â  However, it is not possible to tell for every one of the Flash interactives if they store any data in a Flash cookie. We are phasing out older interactives
For more information on how to control Flash cookies (Local Shared Objects) visit the Adobe website.
