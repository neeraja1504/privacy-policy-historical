Valeo Personal Data Protection general principles
As a global automotive company, Valeo continuously develops and maintains relationship with clients, suppliers, prospects, employees, candidates, students and other stakeholders. For purely business related purposes, Valeo needs to gather, store and use some of their Personal Data.
Valeo also develops products that may collect, use and transfer Personal Data (drivers, passengers, pedestrians….). In very rare occasions, Valeo may act as data processor.
In any event, Valeo is committed to processing Personal Data in compliance with Data Protection Regulations including the recent European Global Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and to respecting the rights of Data Subjects.
Valeo policy is to collect Personal Data in a fair, lawful and transparent way, to use it for legitimate purposes only, to implement measures to protect its integrity, to retain it for no longer than necessary and to fully support the exercise of their rights by Data Subjects.
Where Valeo needs to outsource European Personal Data Processes and/or to transfer European Personal Data outside of the European Union, the selected Data Processors must comply with the Data Protection laws and Valeo Data Protection Contractual terms and instructions. They include Valeo’s requirements in terms of Data Breach, Data Subject rights or claims management and the prohibition of using unapproved sub processors. International transfer clauses are also signed as legally required.
When Valeo develops, engineers and manufactures products that may trigger Data Protection obligations under the GDPR, Valeo takes Privacy and Security by Design into account at the time of engineering and developing such products. The Data Protection obligations where applicable are described in the related product Data Protection specifications, thus allowing the customer to fully understand the actions taken to comply with regulation.
To ensure the proper development and safety of our products, Valeo’s prototypes, at the stage of engineering have to be tested. Some of these tests and pilots may need to be conducted in real life environment and may involve drivers, passengers or pedestrian data collection. Data is collected, analyzed and used for testing only, in relation to the technology under development within a specific Data Protection framework meant to protect Data Subjects.
The above commitments are supported by the Valeo Data Protection Compliance Program that encompasses numerous policies, procedures, tools, forms and contractual clauses as well as a detailed training and awareness program. Valeo whistleblowing System is also available to anyone who has reason to believe that the Valeo Data Protection Compliance Program is not being complied with or wants to report potential violations of this program in the law.
