This Privacy Policy applies regardless of the Device you use to access the Services and whether you are accessing the Services as a registered User or otherwise.
GENERAL
This Privacy Policy governs only the information (i) collected by us from you and/or (ii) provided to us by a Third Party Platform (e.g., Facebook, Apple (iTunes, etc.), Twitter, etc.) about you, in each instance, on or in connection with your use of the Services, and does not cover any other information collected in any other manner or collected by any other entity, unless specifically stated. We may combine your Information (as defined herein) with other information we collect from other sources, such as information you have provided to third parties, including, but not limited to, our affiliated companies, marketing companies or Advertisers and have provided sufficient consent, and, if we do so, our use of the resulting combined Information will be subject to this Privacy Policy.
When we use the term "Personal Information" we mean any information that we collect on or in connection with the Services that would allow someone to identify you or contact you, such as your full name, address, e-mail address or telephone number. When we use the term "Additional Information", we mean any information that we collect on or in connection with the Services other than Personal Information, such as your music, artist or band preferences, etc. (Personal Information and Additional Information will be collectively referred to as "Information"). By visiting, accessing or otherwise using the Services, you affirmatively consent to our collection and use of Information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.
INFORMATION WE COLLECT
User Registration, Features, Functions and Communications. In order to access and use certain features, content or functions, of the Services, you may be asked to provide and/or make available (e.g., via Third Party Platform permissions and consents, etc.) certain Information, including, but not limited to, in connection with registration features, in order to personalize and/or allow you to use these features and functions. This information may include, but not to be limited to, your email address, legal name, date of birth, music, artist or band preferences, and other account information associated with Third Party Platforms, and, in order to conduct fee-based transactions and other activities, your physical address, applicable payment data (e.g., payment card number and expiration date), etc. Access to certain content, features and functionality of the Services may be subject to Additional Terms, including, but not limited to, notices, requirements and settings, which may require that you provide certain Information about yourself in order to personalize and/or allow you to use these Services. At times, you may be presented with the opportunity to sign up to receive newsletters, email communications, or other communications from us in order for us to provide up-to-date information about the Services, and to publicize and promote certain content, products and services offered by us, our business partners and/or other third parties. When there is a separate sign-up for newsletters, we may ask for your contact information such as name and email address, and, sometimes, demographic and profile information. We may ask you to confirm your consent to these uses at the time you sign up for these services or communications.
Contests, Sweepstakes and Surveys. To participate in certain Services-related Promotions, including, but not limited to, contests, sweepstakes and surveys, there may be a separate registration process which may require the submission of both Personal Information and Additional Information (including your full name, email address, mailing address, telephone number, demographic or profile information, etc.). We will use the Information you provide for the purpose of conducting the Promotion (for example, to contact you if you have won). You may also have the opportunity to opt-in to receive special Promotions or offers from our Advertisers as a result of your use of the Services.
Information Collected Through Automatic Data Collection. Our Services include features that automatically collect certain Information such as a unique device identifier assigned to your Device (“UDID”), Third Party Platform anonymous identifiers, your Internet protocol (IP) address (if applicable), location data, and other Information regarding your use of the Services to assist us in authenticating your usage and/or Device, keeping track of your preferences, creating a more tailored user experience, better serving your particular interests and needs, etc. The Services and/or third parties may use "cookies," (which are small data files containing information about you that is stored on your hard drive), "embedded scripts", and other similar tracking technologies (collectively, "Tracking Technologies") to collect Additional Information automatically as you interact with the Services. Some cookies are used to make login to our Services easier (such as by remembering your User ID). Cookies also enable us to track your interaction with the Services and target your interests to enhance your experience with the Services (e.g., for tracking your sessions and use of the playbar, what videos you have in your playbar, etc.). We may also use Tracking Technologies to collect "clickstream" data, such as the domain name of the service providing you with Internet access, your Device type, the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet, your browser type and version, operating system and platform, the average time spent on our Services, pages viewed, content searched for, access times and other relevant statistics, and assign unique identifiers to the Device or other credentials you use to access the Services for the same purposes. Your Personal Information is not collected as part of this process. However, we may associate the information obtained through these Tracking Technologies, and your UDID, Third Party Platform anonymous identifiers and other identifiers and data, with your Personal Information so we can better customize your experience using the Services and provide tailored advertisements, Promotions, recommendations and other content related to your specific interests, activities or profile (e.g., playlist recommendations, etc.). By visiting and using the Services, whether as a registered User or otherwise, you acknowledge, understand and hereby agree that you are giving us your consent to track your activities and your use of the Services as described in this Privacy Policy.
Advertising Service Providers. These Services may also use a variety of third party advertising networks, data exchanges, traffic measurement service providers, marketing analytics service providers and other third parties (collectively, "Third Party Advertising Service Providers") to, for example, serve advertisements on the Services, facilitate targeting of advertisements and/or measure and analyze advertising effectiveness and/or traffic on or in connection with the Services. Such services may enable us to display advertisements based on your use of the Services and other websites, services and platforms you have visited or used. Targeting services enable us to, among other things, help deliver advertisements or other content to you for products and services that you might be interested in, to prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times and to conduct research regarding the usefulness of certain advertisements to you.
