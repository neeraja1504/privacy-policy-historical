Privacy statement - Vanderlande
This is the Privacy Statement of Vanderlande Industries BV (hereinafter: ‘Vanderlande’). It explains how Vanderlande deals with the personal data that it obtains via the websites: www.vanderlande.nl; www.vanderlande.de; and www.vanderlande.com (hereinafter: ‘the Websites’) and personal data that it obtains via offline requests for information or contact.
We understand that you are aware of and care about your personal privacy interests, and we take that seriously. This Privacy Statement describes Vanderlande’s policies and practices regarding its collection and use of your personal data, and sets forth your privacy rights.
We recognise that information privacy is an ongoing responsibility, so we will, from time to time, update this Privacy Statement as we undertake new personal data practices or adopt new privacy policies. We do not knowingly attempt to solicit or receive information from children.
As is true of most websites, the Vanderlande websites collect certain information automatically and store it in log files. We use this information to help us design sites that better suit our users’ needs. It also helps us to diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website, analyse trends, track visitor movements, and gather broad demographic information that assists us in identifying visitor preferences.
Vanderlande collects personal information about its customers, business relations, employees, social media followers and website visitors. We use this data to provide required information to our customer contacts, as well as other parties related to our goods and services.
Vanderlande has its headquarters in The Netherlands. The information that we collect from you will be processed mainly within the European Union (The Netherlands, Spain, Germany and others), but may also take place in the countries outside of the European Union where we have local subsidiaries.
In order to provide you with the best service, your personal data may be made available to local branches of Vanderlande, including those in countries that are outside of the European Economic Area (‘EEA’). These branches will use your data solely for the purposes for which it has been provided, for example performing an agreement that has been concluded with you or for providing information that you have requested.
You are entitled to peruse the personal information that Vanderlande holds in relation to you. You can also object – free of charge –  to the use of your personal data, as far as is reasonably proportionate.
To help protect the privacy of data and personally identifiable information that you transmit through the use of this site, Vanderlande always maintains a security level that is adequate – in view of the latest technical developments – to prevent unauthorised access to, adaptation, disclosure or loss of personal data.
Your personal data is stored by Vanderlande on its servers, and on the servers of the cloud-based database management services Vanderlande engages. These third parties do not use or have access to your personal information for any purpose other than cloud storage and retrieval.
This Privacy Statement does not apply to third-party websites that are associated with the Websites by means of links. Vanderlande does not accept any responsibility or liability regarding how these third parties deal with your personal data. Vanderlande therefore recommends that you always familiarise yourself with the privacy policy on the websites concerned.
Vanderlande has appointed an internal data protection officer for you to contact if you have any questions or concerns about the Vanderlande personal data policies or practices.
We reserve the right to amend the Privacy Statement and Conditions of Use at any time, for any reason, without notice to you, other than the posting of the amended Privacy Statement and Conditions of Use on the Websites.
