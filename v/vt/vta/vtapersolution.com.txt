The information collection, use, and dissemination practices of The V-Taper Solution This policy applies to The V-Taper Solution's collection, use, storage and disclosure of information by The V-Taper Solution on its (a) websites, including all its divisions, subsidiaries and related companies (collectively, the "Websites"), (b) on various third party websites, and (c) to The V-Taper Solution's other information collection, including the purchase of customer lists from third parties. The V-Taper Solution is not responsible for the information collection or privacy practices of third web sites or applications.
1. Collection of Information.
1.1 Survey Information.
The V-Taper Solution collects information from individuals by various methods, including, but not limited to, when an individual voluntarily completes a The V-Taper Solution survey, order form, or a registration pages either online or offline, or by means of online or offline surveys, order forms, or registration pages operated by third parties (collectively, a "Survey"). (As used herein, "online" means using the Internet, including the Websites, and related technologies, and "offline" means by methods other than online, including in person, in the postal mail, using telephones and cell phones, and other similar means.) In the Surveys, The V-Taper Solution or a third party (a "Third Party") may ask an individual to provide various information to The V-Taper Solution , which may include his or her name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, social security number, employment information, personal and online interests, and such other information as may be requested from time to time (together, "Survey Information"). The V-Taper Solution may also collect information concerning an individual from another source and uses that information in combination with information provided from this web site. Completing the Surveys is completely voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to provide Survey Information to The V-Taper Solution or Third Party, but an individual may receive incentives from The V-Taper Solution or a Third Party in exchange for providing Survey Information to The V-Taper Solution.
1.2 Other Information.
Other occasions when The V-Taper Solution obtains information from individuals include (1) when an individual is making a claim for a prize or seeking to redeem an incentive offered by The V-Taper Solution or by a third party, (2) when an individual requests assistance through The V-Taper Solution's customer service department, and (3) when an individual voluntarily subscribes to a The V-Taper Solution service or newsletter (together, "Other Information").
1.3 Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology.
The V-Taper Solution currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about an individual with information about the individual in our database. Additionally, The V-Taper Solution may use other new and evolving sources of information in the future (together, "Technology Information").
(a) Cookies.
A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individual's computer that allows The V-Taper Solution to identify the individual with his or her corresponding data that resides in The V-Taper Solution's database. You may read more about cookies at http://cookiecentral.com. Individuals who use the Websites need to accept cookies in order to use all of the features and functionality of the Websites.
(b) Web Beacons.
A web beacon is programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page (by using an programming function -- see http://truste.org for more information), but can also be used to transfer an individual's unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows The V-Taper Solution to track certain web sites an individual visits online. Web beacons are used to determine products or services an individual may be interested in, and to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes. For example, The V-Taper Solution might place, with the consent of a third party website, a web beacon on the third party's website where fishing products are sold. When Bill, an individual listed in The V-Taper Solution's database, visits the fishing website, The V-Taper Solution receives notice by means of the web beacon that Bill visited the fishing site, and The V-Taper Solution would then update Bill's profile with the information that Bill is interested in fishing. The V-Taper Solution may thereafter present offers of fishing related products and services to Bill. In addition to using web beacons on web pages, The V-Taper Solution also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in The V-Taper Solution's database.
(c) New Technology.
The use of technology on the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly evolving, as is The V-Taper Solution's use of new and evolving technology. As a result, The V-Taper Solution strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use of technology.
1.4 Outside Information.
The V-Taper Solution may receive information about individuals from third parties or from other sources of information outside of The V-Taper Solution including information located in public databases ("Outside Information").
1.5 Individual Information.

The V-Taper Solution will never knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of 13. If The V-Taper Solution obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personal information about a child under the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted from our database. Because it does not collect such information, The V-Taper Solution has no such information to use or to disclose to third parties. The V-Taper Solution has designed this policy in order to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA").
