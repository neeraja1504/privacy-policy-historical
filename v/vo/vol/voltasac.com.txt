Privacy Policy
Voltas Limited (also referred to as "we" "our" or "us") respects your privacy and endeavors to limit the collection of information to the extent required. We also provide adequate safeguards where such information is processed in the way of collection, recording, storing, utilization, disclosure, transfer and deletion, to name a few. In addition to complying with the applicable laws, we believe in processing the data fairly.

Information obtained from your transactions with us
We may also collect information relating to products and services provided to you, including details of requests you may have made, the products and services we may have provided, their delivery, billing and invoicing, any communication or correspondence with you, and other transactional information. We may also record your communication with our customer care or with other such contact points, in accordance with applicable law.
Each item of information might not individually be sufficient to identify you, but combined with certain other types of information, it may suffice and hence fall under the ambit of this Privacy Policy.

Additionally, the information may be used for advertising or marketing purposes as a 'customer statement', testimonial or other quotation, with or without attribution to you. In such cases, we will first obtain your consent, and give you the option of unsubscribing from or refusing such services.
Although we are not obliged to do so, we will usually specify our purpose at the time of asking you for information, and unless otherwise necessitated, we will use it for the stated purposes.
Changes in the terms of information collection and use
The purposes for which we collect information may be modified from time to time depending on change in Voltas' businesses, functioning or policies, or in the applicable laws. Any such change, if not included already under the purposes broadly defined above, shall be intimated to you via the same website.

It is not impacted by the fact of your physical location, or the physical storage of the data, in any particular country. Voltas will not be subject to any additional obligations arising from these circumstances.
