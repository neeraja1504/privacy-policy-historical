Cookies
We may use cookies to obtain non-personally identifiable information from Web site visitors. Such information may include your “Internet Protocol Address,” operating system, browser type and the referring Web site’s address, if any (“Non-Personal Information”). Cookies are files your web browser places on your computer when you visit a website. Depending on your browser, you may be able to reject cookies or indicate when a cookie has been sent. Cookies enable us to customize your user interface, to speed up your interactions with the Website, to improve the Website and to facilitate your navigation through the Website. We may use session cookies (which survive only as long as your browser is open) to perform these tasks. We may also use cookies in order to analyze your Non-Personal Information in order to improve our Website through our analytics provider, as indicated in the “Use and Disclosure” section below.
Use and Disclosure of Personal Information
We use Personal Information to respond to your requests and answer your inquiries, to send you the marketing email you have requested, and for our internal operations purposes. In some cases, we may use a third party service provider to deliver our marketing emails, but they may only use the information we give them for the purpose of sending you the email you’ve requested.
The Personal Information that you provide will be available to us, our agents, representatives. In the future, we may disclose your Personal Information to trusted service providers and contractors for the limited purposes of providing services or information to you or analyzing and improving the Website. These categories of use include, but may not be limited to, communicating to Website visitors, offering certain products and services in connection with the Website (for example, we may ask for Personal Information in order to send you information, with your consent, on new products, special offers, and performance of the Company).
We may also use your Personal and Non-Personal information for the purposes of our internal analyses of our business and the Website. In some cases we may also use analytics software on the Website in order to better understand our customer demographics and our Website’s performance. When we do, that software accesses the Non-Personal Information gathered on the Website and that Non-Personal information may be associated with the Personal Information you have provided to us. The analytics provider is not permitted to use your Personal Information for any purpose other than the provision of analytics to us. We will also disclose Personal Information if in our opinion such disclosure is required (i) by law, (ii) to protect and/or defend our rights and/or (iii) to protect the personal safety of any individual. In addition, in the event that we engage in a business transition with another entity, we may transfer Personal Information to the acquiring or partner entity. We may disclose or use your Personal Information if we deem it necessary, in our sole discretion, to enforce our rights or to protect the safety and security of the Website or any other users.

Because none of the information you send to us is sensitive, we do not currently encrypt transmission to and from the Website. While we take reasonable efforts to ensure the security of information you send to us in our possession, please be aware that no transmission over the Internet can be completely secure. You assume the risk of sending any information to us, our affiliates, our partners, or other third parties over the Internet.
