Log Files
As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp and clickstream data.
We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.
Cookies
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.
We use both temporary and persistent cookies to maintain your session with our website and provide website usage statics. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file. More information about cookie technology can be found on the MicrosoftÂ® website at: http://www.microsoft.com/info/cookies.mspx.
If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site, such as contests or surveys, will be limited. As some of our promotions or surveys may be targeted towards responses to a particular marketing program, if the persistent cookie for that program is not present due to visitor deletion, you may not be invited to participate in the corresponding survey or promotion. We may also employ the use of one pixel images embedded within our web pages (web beacons) to track and analyze user preferences and page traffic in improving our offerings. These images are not tied to personal information.
Third Party Cookies: We may from time to time employ the services of a third party agent in tracking non-personal, statistical and aggregated data about our user base.

Security Measures
If you have questions about security on our Web site, you can send us an email at privacy@vovici.com.
Surveys
When you publish your survey on our servers, we will provide you with a unique URL to display your survey. We will not provide this URL to any other person or entity, but we will provide your survey to any web browser requesting your unique URL. We may review your survey contents for violations of our Use Policy. If we determine your survey is in violation of our Use Policy, we will attempt to contact you and reserve the right to delete your survey and results from our systems.
Survey Results
It's your data. We will not attempt to read your survey results at any time unless explicitly instructed to do so by you, except that, solely with respect to any use of the EFM for CRM Module, we do review, process and provide analysis in aggregate form with respect to the results of specific format questions developed by Vovici regarding the likelihood of a survey respondent to refer others to the applicable products and/or services of an organization. We only disclose this information in aggregate form with respect to the survey results to these questions for the applicable organization for the EFM for CRM Module and not in any way that personally identifies you or your specific response to the questions in the survey. We do not own the contents of the data for your survey. Except for the limited analysis performed by us on the specific responses to the EFM for CRM Module, we only have access to your surveys for purposes of backup and troubleshooting. When your survey results are received by us, we will store them in a secure location. We will only allow your survey results to be downloaded directly into our desktop software or accessed through our online web interface. We have security measures in place to protect your results while stored on our servers and we will prosecute any attempt to access this information without authorization to the fullest extent of the law.
E-Mail Notification System
Our e-mail notification system stores your e-mail addresses on our server in a secured location. These e-mail addresses are kept on the server for tracking and click notification purposes. Much like survey data, these addresses are yours, not the property of Vovici Corporation. Vovici technical support and development may examine these lists for support and troubleshooting purposes. We will not use or sell these e-mail addresses to anyone; any attempt to access your e-mail addresses without your authorization will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.
We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site.
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here or by means of a notice.
