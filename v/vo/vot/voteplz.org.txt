Privacy Policy • voteplz
Last Revised: September 28, 2016
This website is operated by VotePlz, Inc. ("VotePlz", "we" or "us"). This privacy policy ("Policy") explains how personal information is collected, used, and disclosed by VotePlz with respect to your use of the www.voteplz.org Web site and other VotePlz Web and mobile sites and applications which display this Policy (the "Sites") so you can make an informed decision about using the Sites. This Policy also applies to personal information collected on other web sites and mobile sites on our behalf by third party vendors. We reserve the right to change the provisions of this Policy at any time. We will alert you that changes have been made by indicating on the Policy the date it was last updated. We encourage you to review this Policy from time to time to make sure that you understand how any personal information you provide will be used.
As used herein, the term "personal information" means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, address, telephone number, mobile number, e-mail address, or credit card number) and information about that individual or his or her activities that is directly linked to personally identifiable information. Personal information does not include "aggregate" information, which is data we collect about the use of the Sites or about a group or category of services or users, from which individual identities or other personal information has been removed. This Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information.
VotePlz collects personal information in order to help our users register to vote, request mail-in ballots and get to the polls, and to provide other voting-related tools and services. When you register to vote, check your registration status, order your absentee ballot, join our newsletter, or take any other action on this Site, we may ask you to give us contact information, including your name, address, email address and telephone number. We may also obtain information about you from outside sources and combine it with the information we collect through this Site. We use this information to operate this Site, to sends you news and information about VotePlz, to measure the effectiveness of our programs, and to send you timely election reminders. You may opt-out of receiving messages from VotePlz by sending any email to help@voteplz.org and asking that you not receive future email messages. You may also opt-out by following the unsubscribe link at the bottom of each email.
After you mail in or electronically submit your voter registration application form to local or state election officials, it generally becomes a matter of public record from your state of residence. This means it may be available for inspection and use by candidates for public office and their campaign organizations as well as by others who satisfy the requirements of the State law governing its use.
If you have any questions about our security practices or this policy, please contact us at help@voteplz.org. Please read below for our complete privacy policy, and check this page periodically for alterations or amendments – we will occasionally modify this policy in order to ensure that it contains current information about our privacy practices, and we will maintain the version history on this page.
Do not use this site or provide us with information if you do not agree with all of the terms.

Cookies and Data Tracking
In order to better serve our supporters, we use cookies and web beacons, and periodically analyze web logs. Some cookies are used to pre-populate forms for you so that on repeat visits to the Site you don’t need to re-enter certain information. You can set your browser to disable cookies, but then you would not have the advantage of having certain sections of forms being pre-populated for you, and you may not be able to access certain parts of the Site. We may also use third-party services such as Google Analytics. This helps us understand traffic patterns and know if there are problems with our Site. We may also use embedded images in emails to track open rates for our mailings, so that we can tell which mailings appeal most to VotePlz supporters.
The information generated by a cookie about your use of our Site (including your IP address) is transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where Google is legally required, or where such third parties process the information on Google’s behalf. Google can combine your IP address with any other data held by Google. By using this Site, you consent to the processing of data by Google in the manner and for the purposes set out above.
URLs contained in emails may contain an ID that enables us to correctly identify the person who takes an action using a web page. We use these URLs to simplify the process of signing petitions and filling out surveys. We may occasionally present a shortened URL that references a longer URL which you can see in the browser’s address bar when you access the page.
Disclosure of Information
We may disclose personally identifiable information about you to third parties in limited circumstances, including: (1) with your consent; or (2) when we have a good-faith belief it is required by law, such as pursuant to a subpoena or other judicial or administrative order.
If we are required by law to disclose the information that you have submitted, we will attempt to provide you with notice (unless we are prohibited) that a request for your information has been made in order to give you an opportunity to object to the disclosure. We will attempt to provide this notice by email if you have given us an email address, or by postal mail if you have entered a postal address. If you do not challenge the disclosure request, we may be legally required to turn over your information.
In addition, we will independently object to requests for access to information about users of our site that we believe to be improper.
