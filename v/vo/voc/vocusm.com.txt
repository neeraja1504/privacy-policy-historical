Vocus, Inc. is committed to protecting the privacy of anyone who uses Vocus' online software. One of the ways in which we demonstrate this commitment is through the care we take to protect the privacy of information which we collect when we host your data on our servers. Vocus owns and manages all of its servers. We typically purchase or lease these servers, which we then install in a state-of-the-art data center operated by Qwest. Vocus selected Qwest based on its ability to provide fast and redundant access to the Internet and world class facilities for Vocus applications. Vocus has entered into binding legal agreements with Qwest, with the objective, among others, of protecting your privacy, and the privacy of the people who use our software.
Collected Information:
Users' names and email addresses ("Customer Information") are collected and maintained in the Vocus application for purposes of managing the login authentication process, and to allow the application to send notifications to the end user. An example of an application notification would be an email notice informing the user that a scheduled task has been completed.
We promise that we will not give any Customer Information to a third party, unless we are required to do so in order to comply with the law.
If you feel that Vocus is not abiding by this statement, you should contact us by addressing your concerns to privacy@vocus.com.
Cookies:
The Vocus application utilizes session specific cookies so that only authenticated users can navigate the application. We also support non-session cookies for allowing the user to automatically remember their login credentials to gain access to the application. If Advanced User Account Security is enabled, then support for non-session cookies is disabled.
Security:
All hosted environments meet the following physical security requirements - single point of entry to hosting areas; main access monitored with additional access for emergency purposes only; surveillance cameras in facility; access validation with biometric identity check; access only to persons on Vocus' approved access list.
All hosted environments also meet the following electronic security conditions - login validation; creation of accounts only as verified by Vocus; secure SSL (encrypted) connections to access servers; servers running behind secure firewall.
One of the options we offer is Secure Socket Layer (SSL). If you implement our SSL option, we will not transmit Customer Information for the particular user interface that has the SSL over the public internet "in the clear", i.e., without it first being encrypted.
Vocus imposes strict internal controls over those of its employees with access to Customer Information. Such access is granted only on a need to know basis. All hosting administrators are required to undergo criminal and other background checks.
Changes to Personal Information:
Our software is configured to enable you to give your end users the means to access their own personal information for the purposes of deleting it, and/or correcting it.
Changes to Privacy Statement:
Vocus will update this policy from time to time. A "last revised" date will always be included on the bottom of the statement. To keep up-to-date with Vocus' policy, please check this page periodically.
