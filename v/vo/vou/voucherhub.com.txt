What information do we collect?
So we can provide you with the services you have requested, we store information that you choose to give to us in two ways:
Directly from you by details that you enter into the VoucherHub system.
Indirectly from you by information provided by you web browser and Internet Service Provider (see more information about cookies and IP addresses below).
What are cookies?
Our website instructs your web browser to store a small amount of data on your computer containing infomation about your visits to our site. This information includes a unique identifier that is then sent back to us by your browser on subsequent visits.
We use cookies to improve your experience of using our site by providing you with personalised content.
Cookies also help to tell us how and when pages in our website are accessed and by whom.
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may set cookies and use this information to track your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.
Cookie technology does not collect personal or identifiable information. Any information collected is in an aggregate, non-identifiable form. The use of cookies is an industry standard, and many major web sites use them to provide useful features for their customers.
Each web site can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it. But (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites.
You can set your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is added. You may disable cookies and still access our website but, if you reject all cookies, you might not be able to receive personalised content and your experience might not be as helpful as we'd like.
What is an IP address?
An IP Address is a code that identifies a particular computer on the Internet. Every computer, whether it is a web server or the computer you're using right now, requires an IP address to connect to the Internet and to allow for routing information from one computer to another over the Internet.
Each time that you access our website, we store your IP address. We may use this information to help improve the service that we provide. For example, we may use IP address information to detect malicious attempts to disrupt our service.
Who else might see my personal information?
VoucherHub and our agents will not share your personal information with any other company.
We will share your information when required to do so by relevant legislation, or court orders. And should VoucherHub's services be managed by another company at any point in the future, customer information may be deemed a transferable business asset.
What if this Privacy Policy changes?
VoucherHub may update this policy at any time. Please let us know if you would like to be informed of any updates.
