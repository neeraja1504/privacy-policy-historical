Emails

We may also send you other offers from our partners that we think you might be interested in. If you don’t wish to receive emails from us you can click the ‘unsubscribe’ link which will be found at the bottom of all emails from vouchercloud. You will be sent to an ‘update your preferences’ page in your account where you can opt out of different types of email or click unsubscribe from all.
Push notifications
These will be general notifications about our latest offers and location based messages when you are near a venue or shop with an offer. Both types of notification can be controlled in the settings section of the app.
Directly communicating with vouchercloud
When you send email or other communication to vouchercloud, we may retain the communication in order to serve you.
To personalise the content you receive
By collecting data on your activities on our website and application we’ll be able to better understand the types of offers that you’re interested. We’ll then present the most relevant offers for you on our website, application and through the communications we send you.
To provide a better experience
Our use of cookies and other similar technologies enables us to remember information about you when you visit our site. We use this to improve your experience by doing things like remembering your password, automatically logging you into your account and showing you adverts for offers that you’ve previously searched.
We also use your data for the improvement and maintenance of our website and to provide technical support for our website. We also use your data to evaluate your visit to the website and prepare reports or compile statistics to understand the type of people who use our website, how they use our website and to make our website more intuitive. Such details will be anonymised as far as reasonably possible and you will not be identifiable from the information collected.
To provide insight
Our use of technologies, including Segment.io and Google Analytics enables us to gather statistical information about how people use our site and application. As well as using this to improve what we do, we also share it with the brands we work with to give them feedback. The information we share will not identify you personally, it is statistical data and does not identify any personal details whatsoever.
Other uses
We may also collect, use and store your personal information for the following additional reasons:
to deal with any enquiries or issues you have about how we collect, store and use your personal information, or any requests made by you for a copy of the information we hold about you. If we do not have a contract with you, we may process your personal information for these purposes where it is in our legitimate interests for customer services purposes;
for internal corporate reporting, business administration, ensuring adequate insurance coverage for our business, ensuring the security of company facilities, research and development, and to identify and implement business efficiencies. We may process your personal information for these purposes where it is in our legitimate interests to do so;
to comply with any procedures, laws and regulations which apply to us – this may include where we reasonably consider it is in our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of others to comply, as well as where we are legally required to do so; and
to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights – this may include where we reasonably consider it is in our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of others, as well as where we are legally required to do so.
Legal Basis for Processing
We consider that the legal bases for using your personal information as set out in this Privacy Policy are as follows:
our use of your personal information is necessary to perform our obligations under any contract with you (for example, to fulfil an order which you place with us, to comply with the terms of use of our website which you accept by browsing our website); or
our use of your personal information is necessary for complying with our legal obligations (for example, for health and safety purposes); or
where neither (a) nor (b) apply, use of your personal information is necessary for our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of others (for example, to ensure the security of our website). Our legitimate interests are to:
run, grow and develop our business;
operate our website and the Vouchercloud app;
carry out marketing, market research and business development;
place, track and ensure fulfilment of orders with our suppliers; and
for internal group administrative purposes
If we rely on our (or another person's) legitimate interests for using your personal information, we will undertake a balancing test to ensure that our (or the other person's) legitimate interests are not outweighed by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms which require protection of the personal information. You can ask us for information on this balancing test by using the contact details at the end of this Privacy Policy.
We may process your personal information in some cases for marketing purposes on the basis of your consent (which you may withdraw at any time after giving it, as described in this Privacy Policy).
If we rely on your consent for us to use your personal information in a particular way, but you later change your mind, you may withdraw your consent by contacting us at gdpr@vouchercloud.com and we will stop doing so. However, if you withdraw your consent, this may impact the ability for us to be able to provide offers and discounts and associated services to you (for example, we may not be able to provide marketing information to you regarding our suppliers' products and services).
How and why we share your personal information with others
We may share your personal information with our group companies where it is in our legitimate interests to do so for internal administrative purposes (for example, for corporate strategy, compliance, auditing and monitoring, research and development and quality assurance).
We will share your personal information with the following third parties or categories of third parties:
we may share anonymised and aggregated statistical information with our suppliers to demonstrate what interest there has been in any marketing campaigns we have assisted our suppliers in carrying out;
our other service providers and subcontractors, including payment processors, utility providers, suppliers of technical and support services, insurers, logistic providers, and cloud service providers;
companies that assist in our marketing, advertising and promotional activities;
analytics and search engine providers that assist us in the improvement and optimisation of our website; and Any third parties with whom we share your personal information are limited (by law and by contract) in their ability to use your personal information for any purpose other than to provide services for us. We will always ensure that any third parties with whom we share your personal information are subject to privacy and security obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy and applicable laws.
companies that make use of location data associated with an anonymous advertising ID to deliver personalised advertising (Unacast, Safegraph, GroundTruth, Tamoco). Collecting, processing and transfer of this data is handled by our location technology provider, Plot Projects.
We will also disclose your personal information to third parties:
where it is in our legitimate interests to do so to run, grow and develop our business:
if we sell or buy any business or assets, we may disclose your personal information to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets;
if substantially all of our or any of our affiliates' assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal information held by us will be one of the transferred assets;
if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal information in order to comply with any legal obligation, any lawful request from government or law enforcement officials and as may be required to meet national security or law enforcement requirements or prevent illegal activity;
in order to enforce or apply our terms of use, our terms and conditions for customers or any other agreement or to respond to any claims, to protect our rights or the rights of a third party, to protect the safety of any person or to prevent any illegal activity; or
to protect the rights, property, or safety of Vouchercloud, our staff, our customers or other persons. This may include exchanging personal information with other organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
We may also disclose and use anonymised, aggregated reporting and statistics about users of our website or our goods and services for the purpose of internal reporting or reporting to our group or other third parties, and for our marketing and promotion purposes. None of these anonymised, aggregated reports or statistics will enable our users to be personally identified.
Save as expressly detailed above, we will never share, sell or rent any of your personal information to any third party without notifying you and, where necessary, obtaining your consent. If you have given your consent for us to use your personal information in a particular way, but later change your mind, you should contact us and we will stop doing so.
We also work with a third party partner LiveRamp (http://liveramp.com/) to place a cookie on your browser that provides a de-identified, non-human readable version of your email address to use for matching to other data about you to improve the relevance of online advertising and personalisation. Your actual email address is at no time shared with LiveRamp. By depositing the cookie some technical information can be automatically collected (such as IP, your operating system or your browser type).
