NetPerform Privacy Information
This application collects information about the way your phone interacts with our network and services as described below. We hold this data securely and anonymously for 14 months, which lets us view and plan for seasonal variations of network use.
Network coverage
This application will capture statistics about your connectivity for phone calls. This allows us to diagnose connectivity or connection quality problems and make improvements to our network in your area. We log:
the percentage of time your phone is on the network
the cell ID and location of the phone masts used and how you move between them, when your phone is active
signal strength
areas of limited or no service
quality of the coverage (2G, 3G, 4G)
Internet connectivity
This application will capture statistics about your connectivity for internet or data coverage. This allows us to diagnose connectivity or connection quality problems. We log:
every hour, a test of whether you can connect to the internet
your upload and download speed
the cell ID and location of the phone masts used and how you move between them, when your phone is active
areas of limited or no service
quality of the coverage
how long it takes to set up a connection to the internet
Wi-Fi quality
MAC addresses of the Wi-Fi hot spots your device can see
Call quality and usage
The success or failure of your calling experience can be diagnosed using technical details about the network, your coverage, or your phone’s signal quality during a call. This helps us improve all aspects of your calling experience. We log:
* the cell ID and location of phone masts serving your incoming and outgoing calls and other masts used if you change location during the call
* signal strength
* call duration
* how the call ends
* quality of the coverage
Data usage
So that we can diagnose the overall usage of the internet data use on different phone models we capture information about how much your device use internet services and consume data. This helps us improve device and network data efficiency for you and other customers based on real world data usage. We log:
* hourly data use
* how much data your phone uses when in standby mode
* how much data goes over Wi-Fi connections vs. the cellular network
Applications
So that we can identify trends in data usage that help us allocate capacity for data heavy applications in your area, we assess the data use of the applications on your phone. We log:
* what apps are installed on your phone
* how long they are used
* how much data and how fast each app receives and transmits
Device Information
So that we can evaluate the performance of different devices on our network and diagnose phone-related problems and diagnose the overall health of your phone, we log:
phone brand and model
IMEI number, encrypted and masked making it unidentifiable and anonymous
operating system
firmware version
hardware capabilities
language & locale
battery state
memory consumption
time since last reboot
Location
When we measure the items above related to coverage and usage, we know your rough location from the phone mast Wi-Fi hot spot your phone is using. When your phone or one of your apps is using GPS location data, we use that to assess location more precisely and sometimes speed if available with GPS information.This enables us to identify areas of weak coverage and This information will be used to improve poor performance for you and fellow customers.
Anonymisation of Information
The network and device improvements that this application is designed for do not require personal information. This means we do not log personal information, all network data is anonymised by the application before it is sent to Vodafone.
