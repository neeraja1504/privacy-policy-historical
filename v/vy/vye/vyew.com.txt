Review of content uploaded to this site
In case of support related issues, or concerns whether you may have breached the Vyew Service Agreement, we may browse through your content and access your VyewBooks. Any information viewed during such an exercised shall be kept confidential and shall not be disclosed to a third party.
How do we protect information we collect?
We offer secure web pages to collect certain kinds of user information and we store certain kinds of data in encrypted form. We follow reasonable technical and management practices to help protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of data stored on our system. While no computer system is completely secure, we believe the measures implemented by our web site reduce the likelihood of security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved. Vyew’s servers use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), an encryption technology that works with Netscape Navigator, Microsoft Internet Explorer, and AOL's browser, so that only Vyew can read a customer's personal information. How long do we keep user information? We generally keep user data on our server or in our archives for as long as we reasonably need it. We may alter this practice according to changing requirements. For example, we may delete some data if needed to free up storage space. We may keep other data for longer periods if the law requires it. In addition, information posted in a public forum could stay in the public domain indefinitely. Data management requests are administered in an orderly manner to the extent feasible and within our direct control. Note: we have greater control over recently collected data than for archived data. Once data is removed from the system and archived, it may not be feasible to accommodate specific requests. In those cases, our general data retention policy applies.
Third-party sites
This Site contains links to third party websites, including sites of hotel providers that serve as affiliate partners of Simulat. Simulat is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites. Your use of these third party websites is entirely at your own risk. When you click on a link in an Offer Detail, you are essentially taken to the originating affiliate partner’s site.
