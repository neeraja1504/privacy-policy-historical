Do Not Track. Our Site does not respond to Do Not Track signals and we or our third-party service providers may track your activities once you leave our Users may disable certain tracking as discussed in this section (e.g., by disabling cookies).
Cookies. We or our service providers may use cookies to track your activity on our Site. A cookie is a text file that a website transfers to your computer or device for record-keeping purposes. We or our service providers may use cookies to track your activities on our Site, such as the pages visited and time spent on our Site. Most browsers allow users to refuse cookies. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers can inform you about how to prevent a computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify a user upon receipt of a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. If you disable cookies, you may not be able to browse certain areas of our Site or use certain parts of our Services.
Clear GIFs, Pixel Tags, and Other Technologies. Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, which are embedded invisibly on web We or our service providers may use clear GIFs (also known as web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), relating to our Site to track your activities, help us manage content, and compile statistics about usage of our Site. We or our service providers may also use clear GIFs in HTML emails to our users, to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded.
Third-Party Analytics.   We use third-party service providers to evaluate the use of our Site and our Services. We or our service providers use automated devices and applications to evaluate the use of our Site and Services. We or our service providers use these tools to help us improve our Site, Services, performance, and user experiences. These entities may use cookies and other tracking technologies, such as web beacons or Flash cookies, to perform their services.
User-Generated Content
Users can create content on our Site or Services, such as by creating videos using the assets we provide and importing their own assets (such as image and audio files) for inclusion in these videos. You control the sharing and distribution settings for the videos created by you according to the control settings you set for yourself. If you have elected to make your animations public, then other users will be able to see that you posted animations and view your animations.  We cannot prevent such information from being used in a manner that might violate this Privacy Policy, the law or your personal privacy.  If you or other users authorized on your account download or export a video, the resulting video file does not reside on our Site or Services and is no longer governed by this Privacy Policy.
Vyond Community
Users can also post materials and other information through their use of the Vyond Community Site.  You will determine what materials and information you post, and because those postings will be viewable by other users of the Vyond Community Site, you should have no expectation of privacy with respect to such postings.
Third-Party Links
Our Site and Services may contain links to third-party websites. Any access to and use of such linked websites is not governed by this Privacy Policy but instead is governed by the privacy policies of those third-party websites. We are not responsible for the information practices of such third-party websites. ** **
Security
We have taken steps to help protect the information we collect from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. However, no data security measures can guarantee 100% security.  Users should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to their accounts by, among other things, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess and keeping their log-in and password private.  We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords or for any activity on an account because of unauthorized password activity.
In compliance with applicable law, we will notify governmental authorities of any data security breach within 72 hours of our becoming aware of the breach and, if it involves a high risk to your personal information, we will notify you as well.

Our Site and our Service are not directed to children under 18.  We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under 18 years of age.  If we become aware that we have unknowingly registered and collected personal information from a child under the age of 18, we will make reasonable efforts to delete such information from our records and that registration will be subject to immediate termination for violation of our Terms of Service.
California Residents Do Not Track
We do not track our customers over time and across third party websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore do not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals. However, some third-party Sites do keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you and may provide for you to initiate a DNT signal.
Third parties that may place content embedded on Vyond websites such as a social or community feature may set cookies on a user’s browser and/or obtain information about the fact that a web browser visited a specific Vyond website from a certain IP address. Third parties cannot collect any other personally identifiable information from Vyond websites unless you provide it to them directly.
