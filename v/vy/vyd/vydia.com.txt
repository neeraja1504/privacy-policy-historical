A – What are “cookies”?
Cookies are small text files that are sent to a user’s browser by the website visited or when an email is opened. They are used for numerous different purposes, including to remember an individual’s actions and preferences (for example, login data, language, font size, other display settings, etc.), so that the individual does not have to configure them again when visiting again the website, or when moving from page to page within a website. Some operations within a website may not be able to be performed without the use of cookies which, in certain cases, are technically necessary for operation of the website. They may also contain a unique ID code that allows tracking a user’s browsing activities within a website, for statistical or advertising purposes.
Cookies are often divided in two categories, “session cookies” which are automatically deleted when you close your browser, and “persistent cookies” which remain on your device until their pre-set expiration period expires.
When browsing a website, you may receive first party cookies, which are sent by the website or third party cookies, which are sent from websites or web servers other than the website being visited.

These cookies are essential for the proper operation of the functions offered by the website.
Some cookies, known as “profiling cookies” are used to create profiles of users, and to send advertising messages to users in line with the user’s preference that may be inferred from the user’s browsing the website.
