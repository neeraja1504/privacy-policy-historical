If you qualify to win a prize through playing a Velogames Fantasy Cycling game, you may be asked to provide additional information, such as address, date of birth and telephone number, in order for the prize to be fulfilled.
Use of Personal Information
Velogames uses personal information collected from users to improve the game experience.
Director Name
The name of each user is listed next to the team name on several pages on the website, including Team Roster Page, Main Leaderboard pages and Mini League pages. Users are allowed to enter a "fake" director name if they do not want their actual name to appear on the website.
Username
The username is a single-word indentifier, chosen by the user, that will be used for purposes of logging in to the site and to identify logged-in users by means of a Session cookie. This enables the relevant user-specific pages to be shown to the logged-in user, and prevents other visitors of the site accessing team management and account information pages that are specific to the logged-in user. For further details, please see the section on Cookies, below.
Email
Each user must sign up with a valid email address. The valid email address is used to ensure that each user only enters one team, for games where there is a limit of one team per user.
Email addresses are also used to communicate with each user by means of alert emails, which include New Game Announcements, Deadline Approaching emails and also emails automatically generated by the website to provide confirmation of Account Creation, Team Entry and Change of Account details.
Users may opt-out of receiving New Game and Deadline Approaching emails by clicking on the Unsubscribe link at the bottom of each email.
Nationality
The nationality of each team entered into the game is collected on the Team Entry page.
Team nationality is shown on the team roster page, and could also be used for the purpose of generating National Leaderboards.
Nationalities recorded are compiled for marketing purposes into a profile of user nationalities, so that a Geographic User Split can be generated for the purpose of showing to prospective advertisers.
Cookies
Session Cookies
Velogames uses cookies to record session information, enabling the website to identify and remember a logged-in user.
This allows the website to show the relevant user-specific pages to logged-in users, such as their individual team roster page. Session cookies are also used to enable authentication on team management pages, such as the Select Team page, Make Transfers page and Join Leagues page, to ensure that only logged-in users are able to make team management changes on their own team.
Session Cookies can be set to be stored between User Sessions. Users who click the "Remember Me" box upon log-in will have their session cookie stored for multiple visits to Velogames from the same computer. This means that users do not have to log in on each visit to the website.
A Session Cookie set up using the "Remember Me" feature is automatically closed when the user logs in to Velogames on another computer - users cannot be logged in to a single account on two different computers at the same time.
Users who share access with other individuals to a single computer are advised to uncheck the "Remember Me" feature, since they could remain logged in the the website while another user uses the same computer.

Google's use of the DoubleClick cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads to users based on their visit to Velogames and/or other sites on the Internet.
Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy.

Marketing Opt-Ins
Occasionally, Velogames will be asked by Game sponsors to gather personal information relating users who sign up to a game or league, for the purpose of providing future martketing-based initiatives. In these instances, Velogames will include an opt-in box on the team or league sign-up page, requiring the user to opt-in to the scheme.
