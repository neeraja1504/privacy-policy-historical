About VeloNation and the Information We Collect
Profile Information submitted by Members to VeloNation
VeloNation is an online social networking community that connects cyclists through networks of friends for communicating, sharing and meeting other cyclists. To accomplish this, each VeloNation Member creates his or her own user profile, which contains the personal information that the Member chooses to include. This personal information includes such things as:
·  The name of the member
·  Gender, age, martial status and other, similar personal information,
·  Occupation,
·  Location (e.g., city and state), and
·  Photos, videos or other shared content uploaded by the Member to his or her profile, to the extent that it includes personal information.
Other Information submitted by Members to VeloNation
VeloNation also collects Member-submitted account information such as name and email address to identify Members, send notifications related to the use of the VeloNation services and conduct market research and marketing for VeloNation's internal use only. You should also be aware that Members may reveal other personal information while communicating on other areas of the VeloNation website, e.g., while participating in discussions on VeloNation Forums and/or posting information on VeloNation Blogs, news stories, videos, and photos.

Finally, we also collect some information from Members, as well as from other visitors to the VeloNation website, that is not personally identifiable, such as browser type and IP address. This information is gathered from all Members and visitors to the website.
