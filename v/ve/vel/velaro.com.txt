Privacy Role Definitions
The Velaro Live Chat product is a  _ “Processor”  _of Velaro customer data.
Each Velaro Customer is a “Controller” of their visitors’ data
Why Does Velaro Process Data?
Velaro is a Processor of the visitor data of the Controller to enable chat features and provide context to chat engagements.
Consent
Velaro live chat is an application that is installed on Controller websites. It is the responsibility of the Controller to assert an acknowledgment of consent agreement from visitors to process live chat data.
The Controller will need to present and gain agreement from their customers to enable cookie opt-in permissions as required by GDPR rules.
The Controller may need to update their website cookie policy to specify the function of Velaro cookies on their website.
Access & Portability
The visitors of the Controller can access the data captured during their chat by having the chat transcript emailed to them.
The Controller can configure Velaro settings to have data records offloaded to a secure site.
Warnings
Velaro has a process in place that will inform customers if there has been a data breach.
Data is securely encrypted on rest and in-transit, and is housed in the Microsoft Azure cloud. Azure alert procedures are in place.
Security processes are in place to restrict access and protect credentials.
Erase Data
A visitor transcript can be deleted at any time in Velaro by a Controller user with the appropriate permissions.
Controller administrators can enable an Erase feature in Velaro to schedule the deletion of visitor transcript records by age.
Controller administrators can enable a Compliance Mode feature in Velaro to fully offload all private chat transcript visitor information. Compliance Mode also requires the configuration of a secure server hosted by the Controller to house visitor records. Compliance mode ensures EU GDPR and US HIPAA BAA compliance as no personal information is stored by the Processor.
Marketing
Velaro does not use the data of their customers or their customer’s visitors without their consent.
