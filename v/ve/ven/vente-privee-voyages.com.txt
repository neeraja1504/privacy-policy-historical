During an Order, our banking providers also collect and process Personal Data concerning your means of payment (credit card number, expiry date of the credit card, visual cryptogram, which is not kept, etc.). As for us, we process the partial number of your bank card consisting of the first six (6) and last four (4) numbers and the expiry date of your credit card as transmitted by your bank. This payment identifier therefore does not make it possible to perform a bank transaction and is kept for fifteen (15) months, unless you delete it from your Member account.
We also collect information about the transaction (transaction number, purchase details, etc.), or the payment of invoices issued from or via the Site (payment terms, discounts, receipts, balances and unpaid amounts, or relating to loans taken out, amount and duration, name of the lender, etc.).

In this case, the Member concerned will be notified by any means, as well as how to exercise the Specific Rights.
As soon as the Member's payment is received by the Vente-privee.com Recovery Service, his Personal Data will be deleted from the aforementioned file and his Member account reactivated. Until then, the Personal Data contained in the " suspension as a precautionary measure " file (in particular the IP addresses used by the Member) will be shared with the Vente-privee.com Group as needed, to prevent the creation of any new Account, up to three (3) years after the incident giving rise to the suspension, unless the incident at the origin of the report is closed, subject to an additional storage in the Intermediate Archives.

IV  -  Secure browsing on the Internet
** IV  ** -  ** 1. Integrity of your Data on the Internet **
We implement effective means to ensure that your Data is secure. This is why we use control measures that are technical, physical and procedural which are implemented at the time of collection, processing and transfer of your Data.
The security of the Site is the daily work of teams dedicated to this specific matter.
To provide our Members with the necessary security while maintaining the usual browsing comfort, several mechanisms have been implemented.
Connection to our Site is carried out via a secure connection using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) technology. Access can only be gained by entering your Member ID and password, which are personal to you.
** IV  ** -  ** 2. Malicious use **
Nevertheless, you must protect the password of your account and not communicate it to anyone.
To do so, your password must consist of at least 8 characters and a special character, not be composed of the surname, first name or an email address used for your registration. After four unsuccessful attempts, the account will be blocked.
You must also be careful and use good judgement when using one of our community spaces, including those managed by our Partners, such as the social networks: no employee of Vente-privee.com will ask you for your password.
We also recommend that you do not disclose information that can identify you or identify a third party. If you do, we cannot be held responsible on this account. In addition, Vente-privee.com asks you to contact us immediately if you discover an unauthorised or suspicious use of your Data in connection with Vente-privee.com by writing to us at the email address   spoof@vente-privee.com  .
Your password and the links to the Site sent in our emails are for your sole attention, and are confidential.
The emails received from Vente-privee.com, the connection links they contain and your passwords must never be transmitted to other people, to avoid any risk of identity theft.
Apart from Vente-privee.com to which you have voluntarily transmitted your Data and in particular your email address and account, given the nature of the Internet, other operators, who have no connection with Vente-privee.com, are able to capture this Data without your consent, in particular when you browse the Internet. Accordingly, we recommend that you install anti-virus and anti-spyware software and update them regularly.
Indeed, although the Vente-privee.com infrastructures are protected from malicious software called "malware" (viruses, trojans, worms, spyware, etc.), the security of your Terminal and your network remains your responsibility. We recommend that you have an up to date anti-virus on your Terminal, do not let anyone access your wired or wireless home network or WIFI and check that your communications with the Internet are legitimate. You can also install a firewall on your computer.
** IV  ** -  ** 3. Identity theft / Phishing **
Because Vente-privee.com does everything possible to offer you a safe browsing experience on the Site, you will never be asked for your username and password. Vente-privee.com will never send you an email to ask for Personal Data or financial information. You should only provide your account information after logging on to the Site directly through your browser.
If you receive an email from Vente-privee.com that you think is fraudulent, let us know by forwarding it to:   spoof@vente-privee.com  . We work with the competent authorities to arrest and prosecute fraudsters and identity thieves.
If you suspect that your Vente-privee.com account has been spoofed, contact our Member Relations Department as soon as possible, from Monday to Friday from 7am to 8pm and Saturday from 9am to 5pm:
- from France , on:
- from Belgium , on 078 600 087  (cost of a local call from a landline)
In case of fraud concerning your credit card, please contact your bank.
V  -  Security of online payments
The Site uses one of the most effective security systems at the present time. Vente-privee.com has not only adopted the SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption process but has also strengthened all scrambling and encryption processes for the best possible protection of all so-called "sensitive" Data related to means of payment.
For the security of transactions, Vente-privee.com uses the Sogenactif system, developed by Société Générale (https://www.societegenerale.com/sites/default/files/documents/charte-donnee-groupe-societe-generale.pdf), the Mercanet system developed by BNP-Paribas (https ://mabanque.bnpparibas/rsc/contrib/pdf/Charte-donnees-personnelles.pdf), and the be2bill system developed by Dalenys (https://www.dalenys.com/mentions-legales/).
When paying on the Site, your bank details are encrypted on your Terminal, then transmitted in unintelligible form to servers which are solely capable of decrypting them. The authorisations and data are then checked with your bank to prevent abuse and fraud.
This process is based on the HTTPS protocol (implementation of SSLv3 or TLSv1 on HTTP), currently one of the most robust.
During transfers via the Internet, it is therefore impossible to read them: no unencrypted information passes through the Internet or mobile telecommunication networks.
When paying, you have the possibility of saving the details of your credit card to facilitate your future purchases on our Site. We collect your express consent for this purpose, in accordance with the recommendations of the CNIL.
This information is collected, stored and secured only by our Partners subject to the "PCI-DSS" (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard).
The rules for using bank cards require banks domiciled in France to cover the risk of fraudulent use of your card.
We remind you that you must notify any fraudulent transaction to your bank or issuer of your card as soon as possible.
** Express payment **
Société Générale, BNP-Paribas and Dalenys have been chosen by Vente-privee.com, with which you perform your purchase on the Site so that, if you wish, your credit card Data can be stored in a secure manner and used for future payments on our Site.
Société Générale and BNP-Paribas collect the Data relating to your credit card (card number and expiry date) to facilitate your future payments on our Site. This Data is not intended to be used for commercial prospecting purposes. It may be communicated to us, as necessary, with regard to the purpose mentioned above and to the subcontractor(s) of Société Générale and/or BNP-Paribas established in the European Union.
The Data transfers made necessary take place in conditions and with safeguards to ensure the protection of your Personal Data.
You have the same Specific Rights as those mentioned in Article III above. These Specific Rights may be exercised by sending a letter to Vente-privee.com, which will pass your request on to the banking institutions concerned, responsible for the processing of your Data, to the following address: Vente-privee.com, Member Relations Service, 5 bis, rue Francis de Pressensé 93457 La Plaine Saint-Denis Cedex or by email to   modifications@vente-privee.com
