Cookies and other web site technologies
Some information is collected automatically every time you visit Venus. Venus and our third party marketing partner collect information about your computer and assign you "cookies" (small, unique identifier text files) when you visit Venus. You do not provide this information—it is collected automatically as a means of supporting your visit to our site. Cookies do not contain any personal information. This anonymous information may be used by our marketing partner to deliver advertisements for products and services tailored to your interests on this site or other sites that you visit.
Most browsers are automatically set to accept cookies but provide features that enable you to be notified when a cookie is to be placed on your browser, decline the cookie, or delete cookies that have been placed on your browser. Most mobile operating systems also provide you an option in the device settings to limit ad tracking associated with your device id. You may also check your web browser’s instructions, help files or privacy documentation for further information. You should be aware, however, that some functions of our website or application may not work or may work slowly if a cookie is refused. This Venus cookie may be used to provide enhanced online display advertising tailored to your interests. To opt out of this advertising provided directly by Venus, click here. When you access the My Account area of the Venus web site, Venus requires you to sign in using your e-mail address and password. Once you sign in we record the e-mail address in the cookie file on your computer. We may also record your password in this cookie file. Permanent cookie files remain on your computer's hard drive until you manually delete the file.
Use of Technology
These technologies may be used to help us see which of our interactive experiences online users like most for example, by keeping track of the number of times a video, widget or other media is accessed or embedded on social networking sites; and on which social networking sites it is embedded, based on inquiries that are sent to our Services. Cookies, clear gifs, and similar technologies also allow us to associate your online navigational information, or purchases and interactions (both online and offline), with any personal information you provide (such as name, address, phone number, survey responses, and email address). We'll associate this information to deliver products and services to you; to improve our business; to transact business; and to market our products and services on this and other online services and through a variety of media like email, mobile advertising, and direct mail. As an example, we may use cookies to keep track of what you put into your shopping bag. That can help us contact you if your online session is disrupted in mid-purchase, resulting in an abandoned cart. We can also use this technology to determine whether you'd be interested in participating in special events, given your preferences. The end result is a more personalized experience that's tailored to your needs and tastes.
Information Others Observe or Collect through Technology:
We evaluate and select third-party partners to help us provide certain features on our Service and analyze our visitors' preferences. These partners may use some or all the technologies described above.
How is technology used to serve our advertisements on other online services and what choices do you have?

To serve this advertising, these third-party companies place, use, or rely on the technologies described above, including cookies, clear gifs, device identifiers and similar technologies to obtain information about customer interactions with us through our Services and interactions with other online services. These companies use the information they collect to serve you ads that are targeted to your interests.

We don't endorse or generally have any affiliation with these third parties. And we don't control and aren't responsible for their practices. It is possible that the third party providing content through our Services may collect or observe information through its use of technology.
