This Privacy Policy explains how Vend Limited and its related companies (collectively, “Vend”, “us”, “we” or “our”) collect, use, disclose, transfer, protect, store and otherwise process your information. It also explains your rights and options around our use of your personal information and how you can exercise these choices.
Scope of privacy policy
Vend is committed to protecting the privacy of the individuals on Vend’s websites, mobile applications, products and services, (collectively, "Services") that include a link to this Privacy Policy. For the purposes of this Policy, “Subscriber”, as the term is used here, refers to an individual or an entity that registers to use our Services.
In this Privacy Policy, personal information means information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. An identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to his/her physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity. By registering for or using Services you acknowledge the collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information, as described in this Privacy Policy.
Subscriber Information , being personal information relating to our Subscribers and (where applicable) their businesses. We collect this information so that we can provide our Services to those Subscribers. For the purposes of GDPR in the European Union, we are the 'data controller' of this Subscriber Information and we collect and store it for the purposes of providing our Services to Subscribers and maintaining records and contact details relating to those Services and Subscribers. This policy sets out how Vend process your information as a Subscriber.
Customer Information , being personal information relating to individuals with whom our subscribers interact (such as customers of their stores). Subscribers to our Services are solely responsible for establishing policies for and ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, as well as all privacy policies, agreements or other obligations, relating to the collection of personal information in connection with the use of our Services by individuals with whom our Subscribers interact. We collect information under the direction of our Subscribers, and have no direct relationship with individuals whose personal information we process in connection with the use of our Services. If you are a Subscriber providing information (including personal information) about someone else, you must have the legal ability to do so and, if necessary, inform them about how their personal information will be used (as described in this Privacy Policy). If you are an individual who interacts with a Subscriber using our Services - for instance if you’re an employee or customer of a retail store – that Subscriber is the controller of your information and you should contact them directly (e.g. - the owner or manager of the retail store) – for assistance with any requests or questions relating to your personal information.

Preferences information such as notification and marketing preferences

We also store information you upload to or send through our Services, including:
Information about products and services the Subscriber sells (including inventory, pricing, sale, transaction, tax, and other data)

Other Submissions

What other information do we collect?

This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses as well as browser type, URLs of referring/exit pages, operating system, language and location preferences, time/date stamp, search history, device identification numbers and system configuration information. Occasionally, we connect personal information to information gathered in our log files as is necessary to improve our Services. If we do this, we would treat the combined information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Analytics Information
We collect analytics information when you use our Services to help us improve our products and services. We are always aiming to make Vend a better experience for retailers and customers alike, and your information really helps us to do this! This analytics information consists of the function and feature of the Vend Service being used, and the Subscriber's Vend subdomain name (or similar), the username and IP address of the individual who is using the function or feature (which will include any personal information incorporated into the username), and other information needed to detail the operation of the function and the parts of the Services that are being affected.
We use Google Analytics as one of our analytics providers. Refer to Google's Policies and Principleso find out more about the privacy policy of Google Analytics. To prevent analytics information from being sent to Google Analytics, use the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.
Analytics Information Derived from Operational Data
Analytics information also consists of data we collect as a result of running queries against Operational Data across our user base for the purposes of generating Usage Data. "Usage Data" is aggregated data about a category or group of features, services, or users that is not of itself personal information. It is also data about our Subscribers and their business.
We may incidentally come across sensitive or personal information when we compile Usage Data.
Cookies, Web Beacons and Other Tracking Technologie
Cookies, web beacons and other technologies are used by Vend and our third party partners (for example, our advertising and analytics partners) to collect information. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on your hard drive or in device memory for record keeping purposes. We use cookies to give you a better and more personalised use of the Services, to save you logging in every time and to count the number of visits. Vend and our third party partners also collect information using web beacons.

Information from third party services
We may also receive personal information from third parties such as social media, data enrichment or authentication services when, for example, you sign up to our Services, fill in forms on our Services or log onto our Services through such services.

Just be aware that such third party’s use of this information will be governed by the terms and privacy policies of the third party.

Children’s use of the services

Security
We have adopted technical, administrative and physical procedures to collect, manage, maintain and store information in a manner designed to help protect your information from loss, misuse, unauthorised access, and alteration. Unfortunately, no security system is impenetrable and due to the inherent nature of the Internet as an open global communications vehicle, we cannot guarantee that information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers.
Where data is transferred over the Internet as part of the Services, the data is encrypted using industry standard TLS (HTTPS).
For more information about our security practices, please visit www.vendhq.com/security.
Our global operations (including transfers of data from your home country to another)
To bring you Services, we operate globally. In order to do so, your personal information may be transferred to, and processed in countries other than the country you live in, outside of your home country, including to Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom and the United States. These countries may have laws different to what you’re used to. Rest assured, where we disclose personal data to a third party in another country, we put safeguards in place to ensure your personal data remains protected.
Specifically, Vend hosts data with Amazon Web Services in the United States. If you are a non-US resident, this means that your personal information will be transferred to the US. The servers on which personal information is stored are kept in a controlled environment.
European Economic Area (EEA) users: This means that your information may be transferred outside of the EEA. Where your personal information is transferred outside the EEA, it will only be transferred to countries that have been deemed to provide adequate protection for EEA information (like New Zealand), or to a third party where we have approved transfer mechanisms in place to protect your personal information – i.e., by entering into the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses, or by ensuring the entity is Privacy Shield certified (for transfers to US based third parties).
Australian users: The third parties we share data with do not control, and are not permitted to access or use your personal data, except for the limited purpose it was provided. This means that, for the purposes of Australian privacy legislation and Australian users, Vend does not disclose personal data to third parties located overseas
Information retention
Where we process your Subscriber Information, we retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (in connection with the purposes set out above. For Information about how long any of our Subscribers retain your personal information, please contact that Subscriber.
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
Updates to our privacy policy
Vend reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy from time to time, and if we do we will post any changes on this page. Vend will make every effort to communicate any significant changes to you directly. Your continued use of the Services will be deemed acceptance of any updated policy.
