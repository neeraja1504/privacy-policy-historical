We will use the Personal Information you provide us in these circumstances to operate the InterCall website, to the extent required for the delivery of the InterCall Services, to satisfy InterCall's legitimate business interests (such as customer analysis and internal marketing study and analysis), and to provide information you request from the InterCall website ("Primary Use").
Important Notes Regarding Virtual Events: For virtual events, depending upon the type of event, some of the following fields may be displayed throughout the event: first and last name, company, User ID, and User avatar/image. The Sponsor may enable attendees to search for and find other attendees based on a User's registration information. If you associate your actual name or other personally identifiable information with your User ID, the people to whom you have revealed such information will be able to personally identify your activities on the event. In addition, any information you choose to share on any publicly available portion of a virtual event may be collected and used by others without restriction. résumés that you have posted to or within a virtual event may be available to all Sponsors of any booth, even if you have not filed a job application with such Sponsor. You should consult the respective privacy policies of these Sponsors to determine how they will handle your information. InterCall's Privacy Policy does not apply to such Sponsors or their use of your information. InterCall does not control Sponsors' use of your information. If you would prefer that InterCall not disclose your personal information to any such Sponsor, please contact us at privacy@intercall.com. Please be reminded, however, that any information you publicly display or share or that is accessible through the event may already be in such Sponsor's possession, despite such opt-out choice.
Unless you instruct us not to do so, InterCall may also use the Personal Information you provide us to contact you regarding additional or new services and features offered by InterCall, special offers by InterCall, or important information regarding InterCall ("InterCall Secondary Use"). In addition, with your permission, we may provide your Personal Information to other companies who may contact you regarding products, services, and offers that may be of interest to you, but that are not directly related to InterCall or the InterCall website ("Third Party Secondary Use").
InterCall may provide your Personal Information to vendors that assist InterCall in processing such Information or in case you purchase services of Third Parties from InterCall ("Third Party Services"). InterCall requires such vendors to enter into agreements with InterCall prohibiting disclosure of the information to others and restricting its use to providing the contracted services of InterCall.

Also, we will take reasonable steps to give you the opportunity to correct inaccuracies in the Personal Information we retain concerning you and delete Personal Information concerning you upon your request, unless the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to your privacy or where the rights of persons other than you would be violated.

This Privacy Policy outlines our general policy and practices for implementing the Principles, including the types of Information we gather, how we process and use it and the notice and choice affected individuals have regarding our use of and their ability to correct that Information.
Transfers
Unless you have already consented to such disclosure, prior to disclosing Personal Information to a third party, InterCall shall notify you of such disclosure and allow you to opt out of such disclosure.
