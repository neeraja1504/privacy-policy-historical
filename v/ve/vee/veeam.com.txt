Before you access and use our websites or submit your personal information to us, you will be asked to provide your authorization and consent by agreeing to the terms and conditions of this Veeam Data Privacy Policy and consenting to the collection, your submission (if applicable), and processing of information about you as described herein, in compliance with relevant data protection laws.
The collection, use, processing, storage, transfer and disclosure of your Personal Information (as defined below) will be limited to the terms under which you provide Veeam your authorization. Veeam is committed to compliance with all relevant country-specific data privacy laws, including EU Standard Contractual Clauses, model contracts / transfer agreements, privacy statements and policies, and country-specific filings if applicable. This Data Privacy Policy covers www.veeam.com and all other Veeam websites.
Collection of Your Personal Information
Personal information (“Personal Information”) is data that can be used to identify, either directly or indirectly, an individual to whom the information applies. The information that we may collect from you includes your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, contact preferences, occupation, login information (account number, password), marketing preferences, social media account information, and as applicable, IP address.
Veeam will not collect any Personal Information about you unless you voluntarily choose to provide it to us or our partners (e.g. to obtain a newsletter subscription, white papers, participate in surveys, generate product downloads, register for marketing events, promotions or job applications), you provide your explicit consent, or unless it is permitted by applicable laws and regulations. You can always “opt out” at any time by visiting your subscription preferences page, click the "unsubscribe" link in any email or visit the Veeam unsubscribe page.
Use of Your Personal Information
When you do voluntarily provide us with Personal Information, we will use it to provide you information about our products, process your order, register you for an event, create an account, provide customer service, respond to a specific question, offer you the opportunity to participate in contests, register for courses, manage a job application, or provide access to additional information or offers. We also use the information we collect to improve the content of our website, to notify customers of updates to our website, products, and also to contact customers for marketing and sales purposes, including renewals, that are related to a customer’s specific needs and interests.
Disclosure to Third Parties, Service Providers, and Others
In order to support and enhance the customer relationship with you, Veeam may store, process, or share your Personal Information with our worldwide partners and affiliates (e.g. channel partners, credit card processors, data hosters and service providers) to perform a function, provide you with information that you may be interested in or complete a transaction related to your purchase or interest in purchasing Veeam solutions.
Veeam also leverages its worldwide partners and affiliates to provide valuable services on our behalf. To provide these services to you we need your explicit consent to share your Personal Information with them. Third parties with whom we share your Personal Information are all bound by all relevant and applicable data privacy laws, terms of confidentiality and Veeam’s Privacy Policy.
Veeam may also share non-personal summary information with our worldwide partners and affiliates. In the event Veeam shares any information with a worldwide partner or affiliate, Veeam also does so with your explicit consent and Veeam ensures that all worldwide partners or affiliates who do receive information protect the information with the same care and policies as Veeam does. For purposes of this Privacy Policy, non-personal information combined with personal information is treated as Personal Information.
There are times when Veeam may be required to disclose your Personal Information by law, legal process, litigation, and/or requests from public and governmental authorities. Veeam may also disclose your Personal Information for purposes of investigations of threats to national security, compliance with requests from law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, or when we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or protect our operations or users.
Veeam will collect, use or disclose Personal Information supplied by you, for the purposes disclosed to you, unless the disclosure is a use of the Personal Information for an additional purpose related to the original purpose, is necessary to prepare, negotiate and perform a contract with you, is required by law or competent governmental authority, is necessary to establish or preserve a legal claim or defense against a legal claim, or is necessary to prevent fraud or other illegal activities.
