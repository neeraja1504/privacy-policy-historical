Online Advertising
Google AdWords Remarketing We use Google AdWords remarketing to advertise across the internet. AdWords remarketing displays ads that are tailored to you when you visit our Site and other sites. This is done by placing a cookie on your machine that let’s websites know what other websites you’ve visited. This cookie is a persistent cookie—it does not expire when you close your browser and allows for tracking across multiple websites over time. You may opt out of Google’s use of cookies by visiting this website: www.google.com/settings/ads.
Behavioral Advertising We use third parties (such as network advertisers) to serve advertisements on our Sites. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to our Sites and other websites you have visited. This practice is called “behavioral advertising” or “interest based advertising.” Behavioral advertising allows us, and third parties, to target advertisements to you for products and services you might be interested in. Our Sites’ third party ad network providers, the advertisers, the sponsors, and/or traffic measurement services may set and access their own cookies and other technologies on your computer.
These third party cookies and other technologies are set to, among other things:
help deliver advertisements to you that you might be interested in,
prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times, and
help us and third parties understand the usefulness to you of the advertisements that have been delivered to you.
Any images (or any other parts of a web page) served by third parties in association with third party cookies may serve as web beacons which enable third parties to carry out the previously described activities.
Third party cookies and other third party technologies are covered by each third party’s specific privacy policy, not this Policy.
We use a variety of companies to serve advertisements on our Sites.
You may wish to visit www.networkadvertising.org/ to learn more about online advertising. The website provides information about the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”), its members, and your choices regarding having information used by NAI companies, including the “opt-out” procedures of NAI members which are located at: www.networkadvertising.org/choices/.
Google Analytics
We use a tool called “Google Analytics” to collect information about use of our Sites. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit the Sites, what pages they visit when they visit, and what other sites they used prior to coming to our Sites. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve our Sites. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit this site, rather than your name or other identifying information. We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information. Although Google Analytics places a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit this site, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to our Sites is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use (www.google.com/analytics/tos.html) and the Google Privacy Policy (www.google.com/privacypolicy.html). You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to this site by disabling cookies on your browser. For more information about how Google uses data when you use our Sites, you can visit: www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/.
How Does Veggie Grill Secure Personal Information?
Veggie Grill takes reasonable steps to maintain appropriate physical, technical and administrative security to help prevent loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure or modification of information in its control including Personal Information, Collected Data, and Anonymous Data. Although no transmission of data over the Internet or other public network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, Veggie Grill makes reasonable efforts to protect any information you share with us.
