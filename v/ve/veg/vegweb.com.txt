What information will you ask me for?
When you register for a VegWeb.com Membership, you will be asked for some general identifying information which will enable us to provide you with this individualized service, including a pseudonymous name (nickname) for your profile. We also gather contact information (like your email address). This information is used to provide the services that you have requested, or to contact you about the service on our site for which you have expressed interest. We may contact you from time to time with news.
Once you have registered, you will be asked for some personal but non-identifying information to complete your VegFriends profile (i.e. religion, hobbies, whether you have dependants, companion animals, etc.), should you opt to display a VegFriend's profile. This information is linked to your personally identifying information, for VegWeb.com's VegFriends Subscribers to see, if you do not opt to hide your email addresss or you fill out the Profile section titled "Contact Information Viewable by VegWeb.com's VegFriends Subscribers". Obviously, if you provide us with a photograph, some of your information may become personally identifiable information.
How will this information be used and who has access to it?
Your non-personally identifying information is used to personalize your experience, allow other members to find you through a search and to compose your personal profile - which is associated with a pseudonymous identity you have created. Other than your VegWeb.com's VegFriends mail box, your contact information is never available to other members or organizations, unless you do not opt to hide your email addresss or you fill out the Profile section titled "Contact Information Viewable by VegWeb.com's VegFriends Subscribers".
In the event that you decide to become a VegWeb.com's VegFriends Subscriber, you will be asked for your financial information (like credit card number) through PayPal's secured system. You financial information cannot be read by others when you initiate your order through a secured system. You will know you are in secure mode when the tiny padlock icon - located at the bottom of your browser - appears "locked".
The personally identifiable information we collect from you is used for internet review and to improve the content and functionality of our web server or customize the layout of our pages for each individual member. We will never release your personally identifiable information to an external organization without your prior consent except for the purposes of validating credit information and collecting debts. We may disclose your personally identifiable information if we reasonably believe we are required to do so by operation of law, which may include, but is not limited to a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on VegWeb, LLC
How long do you keep the information I've given you?
We keep the information you have given us for as long as you are a member on the site or for as long as we are required to do so by law, which ever is longer.
Can I change the information I have already given you?
You can always verify or request the removal of the personally identifiable information we have collected and change your registration information by logging in and selecting "My Account" from the top-right of any VegWeb page.
Do you monitor online behavior?
Our VegFriends members communicate with each other through chat and onsite mail. While we do not, as a rule, moderate or monitor members' private exchanges, we reserve the right to do so if we suspect users of being under 18 or of using our service for the purpose of solicitation or any other violation of our terms of use or Privacy Policy. Member submissions that appear on the public area of the site are moderated and, if necessary, we reserve the right to edit, delete, remove or not use any communication on a public area of the site.
Members may choose to participate in community polls. The results of these polls are tracked by gender only and do not reveal any personal identifiable information linked to the individual voters.
