9. How we hold and keep your Personal Information Secure
Access to your personal information held by Equifax for Consumer Risk & Identity, Commercial Risk & Information Services is available by subscription only and is tracked and recorded.  Access is subject to contractual terms and conditions.  Access to other personal information is subject to your consent, or is publicly available, or is subject to contractual terms and conditions.  These include compliance with the Privacy Act and other relevant legislation.
We may hold your personal information in paper or other physical form, but it is usually held in electronic form on our systems. To ensure your personal information is secure, we use industry standard security and encryption to protect the personal information we hold on you. Service providers may hold the information for us, such as our data centre providers which have been certified as ISO 27001 compliant. Where a service provider holds your information, we require those service providers to adhere to our approved standards of security and confidentiality to ensure the continuing protection of your personal information.
Only authorised employees are granted access to your personal information. We train the employees who handle your personal information to ensure that your personal information is handled appropriately. Our procedures ensure that your personal information is only made available to employees where necessary.  We audit and monitor our employees’ access to, and handling of, personal information.
10. Further information about your Privacy rights
For further information about the APPs of the Act please visit the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner website at www.oaic.gov.au.
This policy documents how we manage personal information and reflects our obligations under the APPs of the Act.  If you would like information about how we manage personal information as a credit reporting body go to our Credit Reporting Policy. This document does not create any additional rights under contract, statute or equity.
11. Do we collect any other data?
We may collect data about your browsing activity on our online network of internet sites, and from other sources, including information that you voluntarily provide to us online or offline, for example in response to surveys or competitions.
We will not combine this data with personal information about you for sharing with any third party, nor will we provide it to an advertiser or any other third party without your express consent, or as expressly stated in this policy.
For third party online behavioural advertising, we may disclose any data about your activities which is not personal information and does not allow you to be reasonably identifiable to a third party - for example, data associated with a cookie, pixel tag or other tracking code – and permit them to use this data for the purpose of associating that tracking code with your use of our websites, and of third party websites where we or our advertising partners have an arrangement in place to serve ads to you on those third party websites.
We may also collect and use, and permit third parties to collect and use, data from third parties about your online or offline activities, as linked by that third party to that tracking code, to facilitate display of advertisements or content to you that are selected using inferences as to your preferences or interests.  For example, we may collect information related to demographic, behavioural and usage patterns, referred to as “preference data”.  By targeting ads and content to unidentified individuals (such as you) only if you are within a particular interest or preference segment, targeted advertising and targeted content is intended to be more relevant or useful to you.
You may elect to opt-out of third party online behavioural advertising by clicking here to set an opt-out cookie on your browser.
However, opting-out means that the display advertising you see may not be tailored to your interests or preferences and may therefore be less relevant or useful to you.
If you would like to make a complaint in connection with third party online behavioural advertising, you can do so by emailing DDM.ComplaintsAU@equifax.com. For further information on making a complaint please refer to section 6 above.
For further information about how we use cookies, please see our Cookies Policy at www.equifax.com.au/cookies.  You can also manage cookies on your mobile device or in your web browser privacy settings.  See your device or browser FAQs, or Your Online Choices, for more information.
12. Big Data and Machine Learning Activities
For some of our business and analytical activities, Equifax may use big data or machine learning capabilities to gather, acquire or obtain information from various sources by lawful and fair means.  In very rare and limited circumstances these activities may lead to the creation of personal information. For example, when we bring together a large variety of non-identifying information for analysis, an individual may be identified or reasonably identifiable during the analytical process.  Similarly, the creation of insights about an identified individual using analytics may lead to the collection of new categories of personal information about that individual.
Generally our analytical activities use de-identified and/or aggregated data, but we take reasonable steps to ensure that, to the extent any data is personal information, all relevant privacy laws apply to its handling.
