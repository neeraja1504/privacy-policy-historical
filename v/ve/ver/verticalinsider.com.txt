Collected Information
Vertical Insider may collect personal information and data including, but not limited to, application and Website usage data, file transfer and viewing data, email and personal contact information, and other identifiable information provided to us by our Users. Vertical Insider may use technological means for tagging and tracking data including, but not limited to, harmless cookies, clear .GIFs, and other technologies to track and correlate data.
Specifically, but not limited to, the following information is collected:
User Provided Data: Users may provide personally identifiable information (such as a name, credit card data, address, telephone, and an email address) as well as sensitive information (such as Tax ID or Social Security Number) to Vertical Insider when choosing to participate in the services and activities available on the Website (collectively, the “Services”).
Cookies: Cookies, a harmless small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters, are deployed to your computer so as to uniquely identify your presence and use. Vertical Insider may use session cookies and persistent cookies for the purpose of tracking various important data. Use of these cookies can also help to speed your access to the Website as they serve as ‘reminders’ as to who you are to our programming. While we recommend that you allow these cookies to perform their tasks, you may adjust your computer’s settings to restrict or refuse them. However, some features or sections of the Website may not function properly, or not all, if the ability to accept cookies is disabled. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. For more information, please view our Cookie Policy here.
Clear .GIFs: Vertical Insider may choose to utilize “clear .GIFs” to track the online usage patterns of our Users in a non-personally identifiable manner. Additionally, Vertical Insider may also use clear .GIFs in HTML-based emails dispatched to Users so as to track which emails are being opened by the recipients. This act helps Vertical Insider to determine active and inactive email addresses.
Log File Data: When Users log-in to their Vertical Insider account, our servers will automatically record and archive certain information that web-browsers send whenever visiting a website. These server logs may include information vital to validating the User’s authorization to access the account.

Vertical Insider may collect information from other sources to help us correct or supplement our records, improve the quality or personalization of our service to you, and prevent or detect fraud. We work closely with third parties (for example, business partners, service providers, sub-contractors, advertising networks, analytics providers, search information providers, fraud protection services) and may receive information about you from them. Further, and in order to provide the services and improve Vertical Insider’s websites, we may engage the services of third-party vendors. In the process of supplying services to Vertical Insider, these third-party vendors may need to collect Personal Information about you.

Disclosure of Information
Vertical Insider will not rent or sell your Personal Information to others but may disclose personal information with third-party vendors and service providers that work with Vertical Insider. We will only share personal information to these vendors and service providers to help us provide a product or service to you. Examples of third parties we work with are call center operators, shippers, servicers, information processors, financial institutions, data appending and surge scoring companies. These third parties only have access to personal information necessary for them to complete their service.
Vertical Insider provides personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information on Users to subsidiaries, affiliated companies, and other businesses or persons for the purpose of processing such information on behalf of Vertical Insider. Vertical Insider uses third parties such as a credit card processing company to bill Users for transactions, and a credit scoring company to determine business credit scores (when applicable, for extending credit terms to Users upon request). At all times, these parties are required to agree to process such information in compliance with this Privacy Policy, and we deploy reasonable efforts to limit their use of such information.
Vertical Insider reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable and/or non-personally identifiable information that is believed, in good faith, to be appropriate or necessary for the purpose of enforcing the Vertical Insider Terms of Service, or other governing Vertical Insider policies. Other causes of release of data may be due to, but not limited to: (i) taking precautions against liability issues; (ii) to assist government enforcement agencies; (iii) to investigate and defend Vertical Insider against third party claims or allegations; (iv) to protect the security or integrity of the Website and/or Services; and/or (v) to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Vertical Insider, Users of the Website, or others.
Vertical Insider does not share personally identifiable information with other non-affiliated third party companies for their commercial use or marketing use without your consent, except as part of Services.
Vertical Insider does share non-personally identifiable information, such as anonymous User data and traffic data, with interested third parties to assist them in understanding the usage patterns and trends analysis for certain content, advertisements, promotions, services, and/or functionality of the Website.
Vertical Insider may release any information available if required to do so by law, or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with law or the powers of government enforcement agencies. Other causes for release of information could be for needs to comply with copyright laws or to respond to a court order, subpoena, and/or search warrant.  We also may be required to disclose an individual’s personal information in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
Vertical Insider’s accountability for data it receives pursuant to the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield and subsequent transfer of that data to third parties is detailed in the Privacy Shield Principles.  Vertical Insider may be liable pursuant to the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield if said third party agents that Vertical Insider retains processes personal data in a manner inconsistent with pursuant to the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield principles, unless Vertical Insider can demonstrate that it is not responsible for the act or omission giving rise to the damage.  In cases of onward transfer to third parties of data of EU and Swiss individuals received, pursuant to the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield, Vertical Insider is potentially liable.
