Privacy | Verbling
Verbling.com is owned and operated by Verbling, Inc. ("Verbling," "we," or "us"). We provide this Privacy Policy to explain our practices regarding the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of information that apply to our Service, as well as your choices regarding the collection and use of information. Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our Terms of Use http://www.verbling.com/terms. By using our Service, you consent to the data practices prescribed in this statement.
What Information Is Collected?
Personally Identifiable Information: We collect Personally Identifiable Information (as defined below) only when you provide such information directly to us in connection with the Service. We ask for Personally Identifiable Information when you register for a User account with the Service, or if you correspond with us (in which case we will also retain our responses). We may also retain any messages you send through the Service, and may collect information you provide in User Content you post to the Service. We may receive Personally Identifiable Information about you from third parties. For example, if you access our websites or Service through a third-party connection or log-in, for example, through Facebook Connect, etc., that third party may pass certain information about your use of its service to Verbling. If you reside or are located in the EEA, it can also include your IP address or device identifier. This information could include any information that you have permitted the third party to share with us, and any information you have made public in connection with that service. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to our websites or Service. "Personally Identifiable Information" means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, home or other physical address, an email address, phone number or other contact information. By using paid aspects of the Service, you may be required to share billing and payment information with our third-party payment processor, and you expressly agree to the use of your billing and payment information by any such third-party payment processor.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information: We also collect and use information about your interactions with the Service in a manner and format that does not identify you as an individual ("Non-Personally Identifiable Information"). We may collect, use, and disclose the following types of Non-Personally Identifiable Information:
Analytics information: We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, including the web pages you visit, your browser add-ons, your browser's width and height, and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We may collect and use this analytics information together with your Personally Identifiable Information to build a broader profile of our individual Users so that we can serve you better.
Cookies information: When you visit the Service, we may send one or more cookies -- a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters -- to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets Verbling help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site. A cookie may also convey information to us about how you use the Service (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on the Service), and allow us or our business partners to track your usage of the Service over time. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser's directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.
Log file information: Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page. When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information. These server logs may include anonymous information such as your web request, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.
Clear gifs/web beacons information: When you use the Service, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to anonymously track the online usage patterns of our Users anonymously. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our Users to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.
How Is Such Information Used?
Personally Identifiable Information: We may use the Personally Identifiable Information we collect or receive to communicate directly with you. We will occasionally email you updates about technology, announce new features, remind you of events, or inform you about other important news. You always have the option to unsubscribe to these messages. We also use your Personally Identifiable Information to send you Service-related emails (e.g., account verification, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). You may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information: We use or may use cookies, log file, and clear gifs information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) to provide and monitor the effectiveness of our Service; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns; (e) diagnose or fix technology problems; (f) help you efficiently access your information after you sign in; and (h) to provide advertising to your browser or device.
Is The Information Shared or Disclosed?
Personally Identifiable Information: We will not rent or sell your Personally Identifiable Information to third parties outside Verbling and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates without your consent, except as noted below:
Who we may share your Personally Identifiable Information with: We may share your Personally Identifiable Information with third-party business partners for the purpose of providing the Service to you (e.g., email providers, server providers, etc.). Those business partners will be given limited access to the Personally Identifiable Information that is reasonably necessary to deliver the Service, and we will require that such third parties comply with this Privacy Policy.
Who you may choose to share your Personally Identifiable Information with: Any Personal Identifiable Information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service, such as User Content, becomes available to the public. If you remove information that you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Service, or if other Users have copied or saved that information. We may use a third-party service provider to manage payment processing. By using paid aspects of the Service, you agree to share your billing and other payment information with any such third-party payment processor for the purpose of processing your payments.
What happens to your Personally Identifiable Information in the event of a change of control: We may buy or sell/divest the company, or any combination of its products, services, assets and/or businesses. Personally Identifiable Information such as customer names and email addresses, User Content, and other User information (and Non-Personally Identifiable Information) related to the Service will likely be among the items transferred in these types of transactions. We may also transfer or assign such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, acquisitions, bankruptcies, dissolutions or similar transactions or proceedings.
Instances where we are required to share your Personally Identifiable Information: We will disclose Personally Identifiable Information where required to do so by law or subpoena or if we reasonably believe that such action is necessary to (a) comply with the law and the reasonable requests of law enforcement; (b) to enforce our Terms of Use http://www.verbling.com/terms, or to protect the security or integrity of our Service; and/or (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Verbling, our Users or others.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information: We may share Non-Personally Identifiable Information, including information obtained through tools such as cookies, log files, and clear gifs (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.): (i) in any manner permitted for Personally Identifiable Information; and (ii) with our third-party business partners.
