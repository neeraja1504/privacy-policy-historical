Third Party Advertising
Data Collected in Connection with Ad Serving and Targeting. Our goal at Verint is to provide you with ads that are relevant to you. We use the services of reputable third parties to provide us with data collection, reporting, ad response measurement, and site analytics, as well as to assist with the delivery of relevant marketing messages and advertisements. These third parties may view, edit or set their own cookies. We, our third-party service providers, advertisers, advertising networks and platforms, agencies and/or partners may also place web beacons for these third parties. The use of these technologies by these third parties is subject to their own privacy policies and is not covered by this privacy statement.
Often our ads are based on the content of pages you are viewing, but we also provide ads tailored to your interests. Our hope is that by presenting ads tailored to your interests, we will enhance your experience across Verint’s websites.
For example, if you often visit content on the Verint network about Workforce Optimization (WFO), we or our service providers may use “web beacons” to infer your possible interest in WFO and may deliver an ad to you related to that interest when you are on the Site or on a third-party site. It’s important to understand that these technologies use anonymous identifiers within the “cookies” stored in your browser. We offer you choices with regard to interest-based ads. To learn more about interest-based ads and the choices available to you, please visit our AdChoices page.
