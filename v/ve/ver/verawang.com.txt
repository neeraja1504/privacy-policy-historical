Vera Wang Bridal House Ltd. and V.E.W., LTD.

All “personal information” that you give to us will be protected and kept confidential among VEW and its affiliated companies in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Privacy Policy. When we use the term “personal information” we mean any information that can be used to identify or contact a specific individual, such as a name, address, telephone number or e-mail address. With your permission, we may collect certain types of personal information in order to communicate with you regarding VEW-related products, services, promotional events or contests. This policy applies only to information collected by VEW via this Site and does not extend to any other website, whether or not it is affiliated or linked to this Site or to VEW. VEW does not intend to collect any personal information from children under the age of 13 years old. If we learn that a child under the age of 13 has provided personally identifiable information to the Site, we will promptly remove such information from the Site’s files. If our practice changes, we will let you know by posting changes over the Site. Before any changes are made in how your personal information is used, we will give you an opportunity to opt-out.
2. Personal information
Identifiable personal information is collected when users voluntarily register with the Site or contact VEW via the Site in order to receive newsletters, new product launch information, special events information or to answer surveys, enter contests and receive notices of other promotional opportunities.

Subject to the following paragraph, VEW will neither disclose nor sell any information about you to a party unaffiliated or unrelated to VEW except (i) to comply with applicable laws, regulations, subpoenas or court orders or otherwise respond to government inquiries, (ii) protect the rights or property of VEW or its affiliated or related entities or (iii) if VEW reasonably believes that you have used information from the Site in order to commit unlawful acts or acts that may endanger the health and/or safety of the public. VEW may appoint third party service providers to administer and/or operate certain functions or services relating to this Site or VEW’s operations and businesses, the proper performance of which may require a transfer of the information submitted by you. Any such transfer shall be under strict confidentiality and security obligations and for the sole purpose of the performance of those obligations. If you sign up to receive information from VEW but later decide that you no longer want to receive such, you may contact VEW at any time to cancel any option.

By submitting any Unsolicited Materials, you agree that VEW shall have the sole discretion as to how to utilize such Unsolicited Materials and you automatically provide to VEW a perpetual, royalty free license to use and exploit the Unsolicited Materials in any manner in its sole discretion.
