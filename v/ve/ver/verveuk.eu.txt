Individuals’ rights
The GDPR accords individuals clearly specified rights over the data they provide and their expectations of organisations using their personal information.
The right to be informed
Organisations must be fully transparent in the ways in which they are using personal data

This definition provides for a wide range of personal identifiers to constitute personal data, including name, identification number, location data or online identifier, reflecting changes in technology and the way organisations collect information about people’
The right of access
Individuals have the right to know the information organisations hold about them and how it is processed. Exercising this right is referred to as a ‘Subject Access Request’

Our Lawful Basis for processing your data
We will only process your personal data if there is a clear necessity to do this in relation to the services we are providing and in accordance with your individual rights.
In delivery of business services, our lawful basis for processing personal data is that we have a contractual obligation to clients who are in agreement (or negotiation) with the terms and conditions of these services.
We also exercise our legitimate interests to promote relevant commercial services we provide to existing clients in respect of related products, updates and services. We deliver this through email communications and opportunities to be excluded from promotions are available at all times.
Where users opt-in to our mailing list, they will receive emails that may include industry news, service or product updates and relevant marketing promotions based on the lawful basis of consent. If at any time users would like to unsubscribe from receiving emails, we include clear instructions at the bottom of each email or users may contact us directly.
