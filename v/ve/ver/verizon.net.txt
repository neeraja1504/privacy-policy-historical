Privacy Policies | Verizon
At Verizon, we are committed to maintaining strong and meaningful privacy protections for customers. Our privacy policy is designed to inform you about the information we collect, how we use it, and your options about certain uses of information.
Verizon's privacy policy applies to website visitors, app users, applicants and customers in the United States.  It applies across the Verizon family of companies and the products and services we provide, except it does not apply to our Oath or Visible affiliates which have separate privacy policies. In addition, some Verizon services and apps, such as hum, Message+ and AppFlash have additional privacy practices that are presented separately. If there is a conflict between this privacy policy and the service-specific policies, the service-specific policy governs when you are using that service.
A separate policy governs the collection of personal data from individuals located outside of the United States by the Verizon family of companies. Also, contracts between Verizon and its business customers (both U.S. and international) may contain additional privacy-related terms and conditions that are presented in other ways. The Verizon-owned Oath company has its own privacy policy.
Below, we've summarized key elements from our full privacy policy for your convenience.
Information we collect and how it is used
We collect and use information when you interact with us, when you use our products and services, and when you visit our websites. This information is used to deliver, provide and repair products or services; establish and maintain customer accounts and billing records; contact you about our products and services and direct offers or promotions to you; monitor website statistics; and manage and protect our networks. Information may also be aggregated or de-identified for business and marketing uses by us or by third parties.
We may also obtain consumer information from outside companies who provide such data. We use this data and combine it with other information we have to help us analyze and model customer information, predict customer preferences and direct marketing offers. Learn more.
Information provided to or used by third-party advertisers
Verizon and third-party advertisers seek to provide advertising that is more relevant to your interests on  the websites, apps, services and devices you use. Advertising technology companies present on our sites may place cookies on your browser when you visit our sites and others, use device identifiers or use similar technologies to collect information about your activities on our websites or apps and may combine this information with similar information they obtain from other websites and apps.
We also may help third-party advertisers target their ads using certain information about customers, without sharing information that identifies you individually. You have choices and may limit the use of your information. Learn more.
Information sharing
Verizon shares information within our family of companies. You can limit our sharing of certain types of customer information, specifically, Customer Proprietary Network Information and certain credit information, for marketing services different from the ones you have.
We may also share information from Oath as described in the full privacy policy or in a separate service-specific policy. Oath will honor the choices Verizon customers have made about the uses of their information when they receive and use this data.
Except as explained in our Privacy Policy, in privacy policies for specific services, or in agreements with our customers, Verizon does not sell, license or share information that individually identifies our customers with others outside of Verizon who are not doing work on Verizon‘s behalf without your consent. We may share information with our vendors and partners for business purposes and when necessary for them to perform work on our behalf. Verizon may also share certain non-personal identifiable information with outside companies, for example, to assist with the delivery of advertising campaigns, provide aggregate business and marketing insights, or share de-identified information. Learn more.

Changes to the Privacy Policy
If Verizon elects to use or disclose information that identifies you as an individual in a manner that is materially different from that stated in our policy at the time we collected that information from you, we will give you a choice regarding such use or disclosure by appropriate means, which may include use of an opt-out mechanism.
