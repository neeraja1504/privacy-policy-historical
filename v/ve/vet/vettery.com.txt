We take privacy issues very seriously at Vettery, Inc. (“Vettery,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) and we are fully committed to ensuring security of information. This Privacy Policy explains how your personal information is collected, used and disclosed by Vettery. This Privacy Policy applies to our website, www.vettery.com (our “Site”) and the services and software provided on or in connection with the Site (collectively, the “Service”). Please read this Privacy Policy carefully as it contains important information regarding data collection and use.
Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning set forth in the Terms & Conditions.
" Personal Information " means any data collected from you that may allow yourself to be identified. This may include, without limitation, your name, phone number, e-mail address, physical address and any other identifying information.
" Non-Personal Information " shall refer to any information that is not directly linked to your Personal Information and that, standing alone, does not allow for the identification of your individual person.
" Information " shall refer to "Personal Information" and "Non-Personal Information," collectively.
Information you provide to us directly. When you register with Vettery or otherwise communicate with us, we may collect Personal Information from you such as your first and last name, location, phone number, gender, e-mail and mailing addresses, professional title, company name, employment history, education history, personal summary, and password.

All Content and Information that you decide to make publicly available will be visible to other users of the Service.
Information we receive from third party sites you connect to our Service. We may also receive Personal Information about you from third parties and combine that with information we collect through our Service. For example, we may obtain information when you login or register with us through a third party social network or authentication service, such as Facebook, LinkedIn, GitHub or Google. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain Personal Information with us, which could include your name, email address, address book and contacts, or other information. Similarly, when you interact with us through a social media site or third party service, such as when you like, follow or share Vettery content on any third party social network, we may receive certain Information from the social network including your profile information, picture, user ID associated with your social media account, and any other information you permit the social network to share with third parties. The data we receive from these third party sites is dependent upon that third party’s policies and your privacy settings on that third party site. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to our Site or Service.
Location Information. Our servers will also collect your browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (“IP”), domain name, and/or a date/time stamp for your visit. We may approximate your location by your IP address. We also use the Google Maps API to gather information about your location. Google uses various technologies to determine your location, including IP address, GPs and other sensors that may, for example, provide Google with information on nearby devices, WiFi access points and cell towers (see Google Maps privacy policy to learn more). We maintain location information only so long as you maintain an account with us and then delete location data tied to your personal information. We may maintain de-identified location data for a longer period of time in order to analyze aggregate trends and metrics.
Information we receive from third parties. From time to time, we may receive Information about you from third parties and other users. For example, if a user decides to refer you to our Service, we collect your name and e-mail address from that user in order to follow up with you.
