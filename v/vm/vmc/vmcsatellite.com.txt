Sharing of Your Information
Trusted Third Parties
Please be assured that any third parties who have access to the information you provide, including our marketing partners, agents, contractors and business affiliates, have agreed to protect it in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. To fulfill your requests for products and services, we may need to share some of your personally identifiable information with the service provider from which you have requested service. More specifically, when you place an order, we will share contact and ID verification information required by the service provider. The service provider may use this information for credit approval, service activation, and from time to time, its own marketing purposes in accordance with its privacy policy. You should consult the service providers' privacy policy, as this Privacy Policy does not cover their use of your information. We may need to share your personally identifiable information with other third party service providers that assist us with online chat services, credit card processing, fraud screening and shipping in connection with your order and/or use of our site.  We also work closely with and may share your contact information with trusted third party business affiliates to provide you with information on products and services that may be of interest to you.
Co-branded Web Sites and Offers
In addition, you can access Simplexity through many third party co-branded Web sites and partner marketing efforts. For example, if you see a logo on the page that says "Powered by Simplexity," you are on a co-branded page. Whenever you provide contact information on a co-branded page, that data may be shared with the third party site or partner through which you access Simplexity. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of such third parties, as their privacy policy also governs their use of your information.
Simplexity sometimes may offer content (e.g., promotions, affiliations, sponsorships) that is sponsored by or co-branded with identified third parties. By virtue of these relationships, the third parties may obtain personally identifiable and other information that users voluntarily submit or authorize Simplexity to provide to accept the offer. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of such third parties, as their privacy policy also governs the maintenance and use of your information.
Links
This site may contain links to other Web sites whose information practices may be different from ours. Our Privacy Policy does not cover these third party Web sites’ uses of your information. Visitors should consult the sites' privacy notice as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.
Legal Process/Disclaimer
We may disclose personally identifiable information in response to or in connection with judicial or regulatory proceedings or when we believe in good faith that the law requires it, for example, in response to a court order, subpoena or a law enforcement agency's request.
Security
We have put in place multiple levels of physical and electronic security to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access to our systems, maintain data security and securely use the information we collect. These measures include secure Web pages, VeriSign SSL certificate ensuring the privacy and security of order information, and HackerSafe certification, representing the highest security scanning standards of the U.S. government and all major credit card providers. All information submitted is protected by our secure server, which automatically encrypts your personally identifiable information so that it cannot be read while traveling over the Internet.
