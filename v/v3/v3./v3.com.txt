Privacy and Security Statement
We have prepared this Privacy and Security Statement to let you know about the manner in which we collect, use, disclose and otherwise manage the personal information you entrust to us. When you provide personal information, you are consenting to the manner in which MyPhotoAlbum.com Inc. will collect, use, disclose and otherwise manage your personal information, as set out below.
Collection and Use of Personal Information
We may collect personal information that you provide us when you register, cancel or request certain information about our products and services; contact customer service; or provide us with comments or suggestions. Upon registration, you are asked for personal information such as your name, e-mail address and age. Your registration information may be used to make your experience more personalized. We use this information for verification of identity in event of a lost password and to contact you about our product and service announcements, such as changes in terms and conditions. We also use this information to prevent the abuse of children and comply with Internet registration laws.
When you ask a support question, participate in a survey or enter a contest or sweepstakes, we may collect your name, address, phone number and e-mail address. We use this information to administer your request or allow you to participate in a contest. We may also use your personal information to assess and improve the products and services we offer. We will inform you of products and services, sales and special offers that might benefit you. When you register online for our service you agree to allow us to contact you via e-mails about our products, services, sales and special offers.
We may also send you email with information about our product and services. If you would like to stop receiving such promotional information please click on the Unsubscribe link at the bottom of the latest email received. In accordance with the CAN-SPAM law compliance, your opt-out will be honored within 10 business days. Unsubscribing does not apply to communications that are directly related to your registration with MyPhotoAlbum, or the fulfillment of a specific transaction you have requested. Please note that we reserve the right, at a future date, to deny services to any customer who has unsubscribed from a MyPhotoAlbum email.
We use your feedback, suggestions, survey information and comments solely to monitor and/or improve the use and features of our product and service offerings.
Children: Perhaps more important than MyPhotoAlbum's concern for your privacy is our concern for the privacy of children. Due to this, MyPhotoAlbum:
Will never encourage children to use our Sites; and
Do not allow registration for any of our service to anyone under the age of 13; and
Attempt to monitor content of our member albums that would violate our Terms; and
Encourage visitors to report content violations; and
Never market our products or services to children
To serve you better, we may combine the personal information that you give us on our Sites with publicly available information and information we receive from or cross-reference with our marketing partners and others. We use that combined information to enhance and personalize your experience with us, to communicate with you about our products and events that may be of interest to you, and for other promotional purposes.
Companies that work with or on behalf of MyPhotoAlbum: Some MyPhotoAlbum's operations, such as site advertising or email discount offerings, may be managed by third-party affiliated companies. These companies may have access to your personal information on a confidential basis only to the extent necessary to perform their functions as it relates to providing you with a specific service. At no point will these companies have the right to store your personal identifiable information without your consent.
Sale of Business: MyPhotoAlbum reserves the right to transfer any information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets to a third party acquirer.
Legal: Please note that MyPhotoAlbum must provide your personal information in response to a search warrant or other legally valid inquiry or order, or to an investigative body in the case of a breach of an agreement or contravention of law, or as otherwise required by law. We may also disclose personal information to assist us in collecting a debt owed by you.
