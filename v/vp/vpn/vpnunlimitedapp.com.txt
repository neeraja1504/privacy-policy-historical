2. WHAT PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT AND HOW WE COLLECT IT
IMPORTANT: YOUR FAILURE TO PROVIDE CERTAIN PERSONAL DATA MAY MAKE OUR SERVICES OPERATE NOT AS INTENDED OR NOT OPERATE AT ALL FOR YOU.

In Section 2(A-C) of this Privacy Policy, we provide categories of personal data that KeepSolid collects and how KeepSolid collects such personal data when you use the Services.
In Section 2(D) of this Privacy Policy, we provide a description of KeepSolid’s “no logging” policy that applies when you use the VPN Services.

The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) is a United States federal law enacted to give parents increased control over what information is collected from their children online and how such information is used. The law applies to websites and services directed to, and which knowingly collect information from, children under the age of 13. The Services are not directed to children under the age of 13, nor do we knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not provide personal information of any kind whatsoever to KeepSolid. If a child provides us with personal information, a parent or legal guardian of that child may contact us to obtain that information and/or delete it from our records by sending an email to [email protected].
