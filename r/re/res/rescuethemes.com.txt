What personal data we collect and why we collect it
Comments
When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitors IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.
An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here: https://automattic.com/privacy/. After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.
Where we send your data
Visitor comments may be checked through an automated spam detection service.
Like most website operators, Rescue Themes collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Rescue Themes’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Rescue Themes’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Rescue Themes may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
Rescue Themes also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on rescuethemes.com blogs/sites. Rescue Themes only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog/site where the comment was left.
We use Mailchimp for our email marketing and automation.
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to Rescue Themes’s websites choose to interact with Rescue Themes in ways that require Rescue Themes to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Rescue Themes gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up at rescuethemes.comto provide a username, email address, and other personal information. Those who engage in transactions with Rescue Themes are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Rescue Themes collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Rescue Themes . Rescue Themes does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
Aggregated Statistics
Rescue Themes may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. Rescue Themes may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Rescue Themes does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
Rescue Themes discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Rescue Themes’s behalf or to provide services available at Rescue Themes’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Rescue Themes’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Rescue Themes will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Rescue Themes discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Rescue Themes believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Rescue Themes, third parties or the public at large.

If you send us a request (for example via email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Rescue Themes takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
