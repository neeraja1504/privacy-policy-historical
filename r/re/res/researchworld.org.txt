ESOMAR - Privacy Policy
This is the Privacy Policy of ESOMAR B.V. and The Society of ESOMAR (“ESOMAR”).
ESOMAR, as Controller, complies with the Personal Data Protection Act of the Netherlands, which is based on the EU Data Protection directive.
What is Personal Data?
Personal data is the information that identifies you, such as your name, address, email or postal address.
What is it used for?
ESOMAR collects and processes personal data of members and customers. ESOMAR is convinced that a privacy policy is of utmost importance.
ESOMAR respects the personal data of members and customers and does not sell, rent, loan, trade or otherwise transfer any personal data to any third party unless this is necessary to deliver ESOMAR’s products and services.
ESOMAR does not request personal data from you, other than to process a transaction or application for ESOMAR membership and/or company listing in the ESOMAR Directory, a registration for an ESOMAR event, or an order for an ESOMAR publication, such as the online Directory of members* or for analytical research.
ESOMAR will also use your personal data to inform you about activities, products and services of ESOMAR and relevant third parties, unless you have notified ESOMAR that you do not to wish to receive such information.
ESOMAR will only share your personal information with a third party if you expressly ask to receive information from them. Please note that to stop receiving information from a third party, you will need to contact them directly.
*Only Members are entitled to access the Directory of Members.
The use of e-mail
ESOMAR will only use the e-mail address of member and customers, outside the scope of membership or a transaction, for the purpose where a member and/or customer has given opt-in. ESOMAR will always provide you in every e-mail, where relevant, with an unsubscribe link.

The Directory of ESOMAR Members
The Directory of ESOMAR Members may not be used for mailings, electronic or otherwise for direct marketing purposes.

ESOMAR recognises the importance of data privacy regulations and reminds members that they are responsible for any misuse of the Directory within their organisation or by third parties contracted to provide their organisation with services.
Members should not send unsolicited email to other members unless it is for a specific purpose relating to that member eg to ask for a bid for a project.
ESOMAR reserves the right to withdraw membership services from those who misuse the Directory. ESOMAR reserves also the right of seed-addresses to monitor the use of the Directory in accordance with this policy.
