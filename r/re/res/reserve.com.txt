Usage Information
We may also use a variety of technologies to passively collect other information as you use or interact with the Services ("Usage Information"). For example, Usage Information may include the browser that you are using, the URL that referred you to our website(s), all of the areas within our website(s) that you visit, access times, precise location data, and your IP address or other unique identifier ("Device Identifier") for your computer, mobile phone or other device used to access the Services (each, a "Device"). Usage Information may be non-identifying or may be associated with you. Whenever we associate Usage Information or a Device Identifier with you, we will treat it as Personal Information.
We may also have features that allow you to share Usage Information with other people (such as your family, friends or colleagues) if you choose. For example, when you choose to split the bill for a meal with other users, all users splitting the bill may be able to see the information associated with the reservation for that meal, as well as certain information about other users (such as the other users' names and profile photo) who have agreed to split the bill for that meal.
A few methods that may be used to collect Usage Information include, without limitation, the following (and may include technologies and methods developed hereafter):
Cookies. When you visit our Site we may send one or more cookies to your Device. A cookie is a data file that is used for various purposes, including, among other things, to identify your browser, remember you and your preferences, and track your visits to our Site. A cookie does not collect Personal Information about you. Cookies can be disabled or controlled by setting a preference within your web browser or on your Device. However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.
Web Beacons. We may employ small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as "1x1 GIFs" or "clear GIFs") in our Site and email messages, which are used to anonymously track the online usage patterns of our users and to track which emails are opened by recipients.
The only way to completely "opt out" of the collection of any information through cookies or other tracking technology is to actively manage the settings on your browser or mobile device. Please refer to your browser's or mobile device's technical information for instructions on how to delete and disable cookies, and other tracking/recording tools.

For example, he or she may be able accept or decline your request to split the bill and, after accepting, may also chose to leave the bill if he or she no longer wants to split the bill. By way of further example, the people you invite to split a bill may choose to not respond to your invitation. You may receive text messages, push notifications and/or in-app notifications concerning the status of the bill splitting invitations you've sent and may be able to see the status of such invitations in the app.

Storage and Security of Your Information
Your information collected through the Services may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Reserve or its subsidiaries, affiliates or service providers maintain facilities. Reserve may transfer information that we collect about you, including Personal Information, to affiliated entities, or to other third parties across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that we may transfer information, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction, and you consent to the transfer of information to the U.S. or any other country in which Reserve or its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates or service providers maintain facilities and the use and disclosure of information about you as described in this Privacy Policy.
The information we collect is securely stored within our databases, and we use standard, industry-wide, commercially reasonable security practices such as encryption, firewalls and SSL (Secure Socket Layers) for protecting your information, such as any portions of your credit card number which we retain (we do not ourselves retain your full credit card information) and reservation information. To be clear, Reserve does not itself store your full credit or debit card information and we do not have direct control over or responsibility for your debit or credit card information. Our contracts with our third party payment processors that receive your credit or debit card information require them to keep it secure.
Nevertheless, as effective as encryption technology is, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our databases or our third party payment processors' databases, nor can we guarantee that information you supply won't be intercepted while being transmitted to us and/or to our third party payment processors over the Internet or via wireless communication, and any information you transmit to Reserve is done at your own risk. We assume no liability or responsibility for disclosure of your information due to errors in transmission, unauthorized third party access, or other causes beyond our control.
You also play an important part in keeping your Personal Information secure. You are responsible for selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your Devices and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account. We also recommend that you not disclose your password to anyone.

You may also remove or update your photo at anytime by signing into your account. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you with the Services, you can also contact us at support@reserve.com.
As noted above, you may opt-out of receiving SMS text messages at any time by emailing us at support@reserve.com or by texting STOP in response to the text messages you receive. However, by opting-out of receiving SMS text messages, we may have to temporarily suspend your account, during which time you will no longer be able to use the Services.
We will retain your information for as long as your account with Reserve is active and as is needed to provide you the Services. Even after your account is terminated, we may retain your information (including, but not limited to, Personal Information and Usage Information) as needed to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations, resolve disputes, conclude any activities related to cancellation of an account (such as addressing chargebacks from your credit card companies), investigate or prevent fraud and other inappropriate activity, to enforce our agreements, and for other business reasons. After a period of time, your data may be anonymized and aggregated, and then may be held by us as long as necessary for us to provide our Services effectively.
Your Choices About Your Information
You may, of course, decline to provide us with some or all of your Personal Information, but keep in mind that without certain Personal Information we may not be able to provide you with the Services or certain features of the Services.
Children's Privacy
Our Services are not directed to children under 13 years old. Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, Reserve does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register for the Services. If you are under 13, please do not send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 13 is allowed to provide any personal information to or on Reserve. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at support@reserve.com.
Changes to Our Privacy Policy
We're constantly trying to improve our Services, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time and reserve the right to do so. If we change this Privacy Policy, we will post those changes so as to keep you informed as to what information we collect and how we are using and disclosing that information. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when posted on this page, as indicated by the Last Updated date at the top of this page. By continuing to access or use the Services after a change in this Privacy Policy has been posted, you are agreeing to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.
If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or any of our privacy-related practices, please contact us at support@reserve.com.
