Collection of Information ResortPass collects information from users at different points on the website. Some of the information is collected when you provide us with information and other information is collected through your use of the website.
We collect information that you give to us. At the time you register, create an account or fill in forms on our website, or you send us a communication, we collect and store such information as you may provide. We may collect specific information such as your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, a unique login name, password, and password validation. We may also collect information when you complete a survey, enter a contest or promotion we sponsor, or when you report a problem with our website. To enable payment for goods or services purchased through ResortPass, such as Day Passes, we collect and store billing, credit card or other payment information.
If you provide feedback to us, we may use and disclose such feedback for any purpose, provided we do not associate such feedback with your personal information. We will collect any information contained in such feedback and will treat the personal information in it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. You agree that any such comments and any e-mail we receive becomes our property. We may use feedback for marketing purposes or to add to or modify our services without paying any royalties or other compensation to you.
We may automatically collect certain information when you use this website, such as your location, a device identifier, IP address, operating system, the browser, web pages viewed, etc. We use the personally identifiable information mentioned above to develop, deliver, protect, and improve our products, services, content, and customer communications.
As most websites do, we use “cookies” to collect information about your use of the website. Cookies are small files stored by your browser on your hard drive. We use the information that we collect in this way to better understand our users’ interaction with our website or services and to optimize the user experience.

Certain information you post or provide through ResortPass for public posting, such as your name, profile, comments and reviews, may be shared with other users and posted on publicly available portions of ResortPass, including without limitation, social media applications and other public fora in which you choose to participate. Please keep in mind that if you choose to disclose personal information when posting comments or other information or content through ResortPass, this information may become publicly available and may be collected and used by others, including people outside the ResortPass community. It is up to you to make sure you are comfortable with the information you choose to provide us and the information you choose to publish. We will not have any obligations with respect to any information that you post to parts of ResortPass available to others, and recommend that you use caution when giving out personal information to others through social media networks or otherwise.

We may provide your personal information to third-party service providers or affiliates who work on behalf of or with us to provide some of the services and features of ResortPass and to help us communicate with you. Examples of such services include sending e-mails, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing payments (including credit card payments) and providing customer service.
