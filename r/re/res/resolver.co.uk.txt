Privacy policy | Resolver
Effective as of 10th October 2018, Resolving Limited (“Resolver”) and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Resolver Group” or “we” or “us” or “our”) have updated our Privacy Policy.
Please read this document carefully before using resolver.co.uk, the Resolver app, or the Resolver email service.
1. Introduction
We are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy.
This policy (together with our terms of use and any other documents referred to on it) sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed.
For the purpose of the Data Protection Act 2018 and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the data controller is Resolving Limited, 56 Ayres Street, London, SE1 1EU.
Our nominated representative for the purpose of the Act is James Walker.
2. Information we collect from you
We may collect and process the following data about you:
The information you give us. When you register to use Resolver or submit a complaint using our service, you give us personal information and information about your case. You can do this via our website www.resolver.co.uk, on the Resolver apps, or by corresponding with us by phone, email or otherwise. This includes information you provide when you register to use our site, our apps, other social media functions on our site, create a case, and when you get in touch with our customer service team, for example via the Help Centre.
The information you give us may include your name, address, e-mail address phone number, and information you provide as part of your case.
Information we collect about you. Each time you visit our site or use our apps we may automatically collect the following information:
technical information, including the internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet, your login information, browser type and version, time zone setting, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform;
information about your visit, including the full Uniform Resource Locators (URL) clickstream to, through and from our site (including date and time); products you viewed or searched for; page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), methods used to browse away from the page, and any phone number used to call our customer service number.
Information we receive from other sources. We work with third parties (including sub-contractors in technical, payment and delivery services, and advertising networks) and may receive information about you from them.
3. Lawful basis for Processing
We only process your data when we have a lawful reason for doing so. The lawful reason we use to process your personal data may differ for each processing activity.
The personal information that we collect so that we can provide you with the services, products or information you have requested, is processed under Legitimate Interest. This means that it is in the interests of both the data subject (yourself) and Resolver to process the data, i.e. so that your case can be raised and resolved. We have conducted a balancing test to ensure that Resolver’s interests do not outweigh those of the data subject.
All direct marketing communications will require your consent.
4. How long we keep your data for
We keep your personal information in line with our data retention policy, and will only retain it for as long as is necessary for the purpose(s) for which we originally collected it.
In certain circumstances we have a statutory obligation to keep your personal information for a set period of time for example financial information (normally 6-7 years) for financial auditing purposes. If you require more information about our data retention policy then please contact us via the Help Centre.
5. Chat Bot Users
Whilst you are using the chat bot we are able to see the information that you have made public on Facebook. Therefore we may be able to see your name, age range and location. However we do not store or further process this personal data.
If at the end of your chat bot session you wish to raise a complaint about a company, then we will direct you to our main website where we will ask you to register, if you’ve not done so before, and from that point the remainder of this Privacy Policy applies in relation to the collection and processing of your personal data in relation to raising and processing a complaint.
