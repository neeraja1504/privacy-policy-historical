Consent for Collection, Use and Disclosure
---|---
Your use of the Underfox site(s) and/or your registration for Underfox products and services constitute your consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy.  If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use any Underfox site(s).
Underfox Corporation may occasionally update this Privacy Policy.  When it does, Underfox will also revise the “last update” date at the top of this Privacy Policy.  In addition, Underfox will seek a customer’s prior consent, by email, for any new uses or proposed disclosures of information collected from the customer prior to the change. **  **Underfox may or may not notify customers by email of changes to this policy that will affect information collected from them in the future.  In certain circumstances, however, Underfox will not inform and obtain the consent of the customer, such as in connection with an investigation of a breach of an agreement, contravention of laws, an emergency where the life, health or security of an individual is threatened, the collection of a debt or in compliance with the request of a law enforcement agency or a court order.
A customer may withdraw his or her consent for collection, use and disclosure at any time by sending an email to postmaster@underfox.com.  Please note that, if you do, Underfox may suspend its provision of products and services to you.  When you unsubscribe, if you fall within the guarantee period for any Underfox product and you request a refund, the guarantee will be honored.
Underfox collects, at the time of your registration and your sign-on to its web site, certain “personal information” (information that personally identifies you) including but not limited to your name, email address, home or work address, telephone number, and information about your computer hardware and software ( e.g. , IP address, operating system, browser type, domain name, URL, access times, and referring web site addresses).
Underfox has implemented this Privacy Policy to protect personal information received from its customers, and to respond to any inquiries.  The Privacy Policy also provides that Underfox will use appropriate contractual means to establish a comparable level of protection for personal information which is sent for processing by third parties on Underfox’s behalf.
Underfox has designated responsibility for your personal information to its Privacy Dept, which ensures compliance with the principles in this Privacy Policy.
If any affiliate, reseller or any persons or entities send visitors to any or our websites using unsolicited (spam) email, their IP will be banned permanently and seize all business relationships with the party. In addition, any commissions generated using such methods will be forfeited.
