The types of Personal Information collected may include your name, email address, phone numbers, Twitter and/or Facebook user names, usage information regarding your use of our Service, and browser information. We automatically receive your location when you use the Service. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as allowing you to set up a user account and profile that can be used to interact with other users through the Service, improving the content of the Service, customizing the advertising and content you see, and communicating with you about specials and new features. We may also draw upon this Personal Information in order to adapt the Services of our community to your needs, to research the effectiveness of our network and Services, and to develop new tools for the community.
Information Collected Automatically:  When you use the Service, RESAAS automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser or mobile platform, including your location, IP address, cookie information, and the page you requested. We treat this data as non-Personal Information, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law. RESAAS only uses this data in aggregate form. We may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use our site, so that our partners may also understand how often people use their services and our Service.
Web Beacons:   Web pages on our Site, including third-party advertisements and offers, may contain non-visible electronic images (called “web beacons,” “single-pixel GIFs” or “1×1 GIFs”) that allow the Site to access cookies or to count users who have visited particular pages on the Site. We may also send you HTML-formatted email messages (messages that include graphics) that contain web beacons, which allow us to determine which email messages were opened and whether a message was acted upon, as well as access cookies and count users.
Accessing the Site From Online Banner Ads:   If you come to the Site from an online banner ad on another site, an anonymous identification number may be passed to the Site.  This information cannot be used to gather any personally identifiable information about you. It will only allow us to track the overall effectiveness of our online advertising campaigns.
**Purchases:  ** When you purchase products or services from our Site, you may be entering information into a website controlled and operated by a service provider on our behalf. You will be interacting directly with the service provider.  The service provider may collect and use information about you in a way that is different from this Privacy Policy.  We encourage you to read the service provider’s privacy statement.  The service provider may provide us with information about you, in which case our use of such information will be subject to this Privacy Policy.
How Do You Share My Personal Information?
We do not sell or provide the personally identifying information that we obtain about you through this Site to third parties unless you request or permit us to do so or the disclosure is permitted or required by law.  Some of the circumstances under which we may provide information about you are described below.
Your Profile:   As you know, certain information in your profile is intended to be public. When you enter information in your profile, we will indicate what will or will not be made public. This information is viewable by the public and by other users.
User Generated Content (UGC):  If you upload videos and other content to the Site, you may be revealing otherwise private information about yourself or other people. Any videos and other content that you submit to us may be redistributed through the internet and other media channels, and may be viewed by other users or the public.

Indirectly:  We may permit third parties to mail or email advertisements or offers to you in a fashion that prevents them from learning personally identifying information about you.  If you respond to an advertisement or offer from a third party, that party may collect and use information about you in a way that is different from this Policy; we encourage you to read the privacy statement of any such third party.
Public Forums:   Certain portions of the Site (e.g., chat rooms, forums and message boards) may be available to the public or other Site users. If you provide information at such locations, your disclosures will not be private.
