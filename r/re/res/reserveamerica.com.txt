Privacy Policy | Aspira
Overview
RA Outdoors, LLC, doing business as Aspira, and its affiliated companies and subsidiaries (collectively, “Aspira”, “us”, “we”, or “our”) value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. Aspira is a leading provider of software and services for outdoors related activities. In this Privacy Policy (“Policy”), we describe the information that we collect from visitors to and users of our websites (“Sites”), our blogs, our mobile applications (“Applications”), and our online products and services (collectively, “Services”). By visiting our Sites or using any of our Services, you agree that your personal information will be handled as described in this Policy, which is incorporated by reference into our Terms of Use.
If you have questions or complaints regarding our privacy policy or practices, please contact us at privacy@aspiraconnect.com.
What information do we collect about you and why?
The information we collect from you allows you to log into our Sites and use our Services and Applications. We also collect information from businesses, organizations, and individuals who request information from us.
Individuals may provide us information directly or indirectly by using our Services (these individuals are referred to as “Consumers”). For example, you may enter your information in order to reserve a campsite or purchase a campsite permit or a hunting or fishing license. Relatedly, organizations and entities that use our Services to provide a service to Consumers (our “Clients”) (including agents of our Clients) may provide us with personal information about individuals who have reserved a campsite or purchased a hunting or fishing license or who the Client wants us to contact or otherwise provide Services to on behalf of the Client.
Information We Collect Directly From You.
Account Information for our Sites.  You may browse our Sites without creating an online account or providing us with your information, but to use certain features, you may need to create an account or otherwise provide us with information. When you create an account with us or register for an activity, we may ask you to provide the following:
Your first and last name;
Your email address and your desired password;
Your display name (this is the name other people will see when you post items to one of our Sites or engage in other similar activities on our site);
Your date of birth;
Your subscription preferences (whether and what types of information you would like us to send you);
Information about your activities and interests;
Other profile data, such as contact information, occupation, gender and photo; and
Payment information, such as credit card or financial account numbers (if applicable).
Log in Information for our Sites.  Once you have signed up for a particular Site, on subsequent visits to the same Site, you may simply need to enter your user ID or email address (as applicable) and password to gain access to that Site.
Log in and Location Information for our Applications.  When you first visit any of our Applications, you may have the option of creating a user ID and password for subsequent visits. When you log into certain of our Applications, we will request your permission to obtain your current location (so-called “geolocation” information) so that we can provide location-related services, for example, so that we can help you to find a campground, locations to purchase equipment, and other valuable information. In the “settings” function on your phone, you will have the ability to manually permit or preclude us from recording your geolocation information for certain Applications or features of Applications.
Contests, Surveys and Questionnaires.  When you sign up for sweepstakes or contests, or complete questionnaires or surveys, we collect information that you submit to us. We use this information to administer the sweepstakes, contest or survey, to analyze the results, for research purposes, to send you other information or offers we think may be of interest to you, to comply with legal requirements, and for other purposes as discussed in this Policy.
Licenses, Reservations, Permits, and Fines.  When you purchase hunting or fishing licenses, camping permits, or submit payment for fines, we may require additional information about you in order to complete your request. For example, we may need your driver’s license number, social security number, or visa or passport number in order to verify your identity and process your request. In addition, we might collect public agency reservation information (e.g., information about your planned visit to a specific government agency-operated or government agency-administered campground or park, such as dates of stay or number of occupants, other than personal information). Any such personal information is used only as necessary in order to help complete your transaction.
User Profiles, Comments and Posts.  Some of our Sites and Applications may allow users to create or post content, such as comments, profiles, blogs, and messages. If you provide content to our Sites, we may collect and use that information as described in this Policy. Please note that such information may be viewed, collected or used by other registered users and public visitors to our Sites. Once posted, we cannot prevent such information from being used in a manner that may violate this Policy, the law or your personal privacy. Your profile, however, may offer privacy settings within your account to help you manage how your content is displayed.
Job Site References.  As part of applying for employment with us, we may ask you for information such as details regarding your education, employment history, qualifications, and the contact information of a former colleague’s name. This information is used for job reference purposes only and is not used for any other purpose.
Information We Collect from Facebook.  We may provide you with the opportunity to connect via Facebook, through our Sites or Applications. If you log into Facebook through our Sites or Applications, we will request permission to access your basic information, which includes your name, profile picture, gender, networks, Facebook user ID, list of friends and any other information that you have made public on Facebook. For information about how Facebook may disclose your information, including any information you make public, please consult the Facebook Data Use Policy. We have no control over how Facebook uses or discloses the personal information you provide to it. We store the information that we receive from Facebook along with other information that we collect from you or receive about you.
Information We Collect About You From Third Parties.  We also may collect information, including personally identifiable information, about you from our affiliates and non-affiliated third parties.
Information We Collect Automatically.  We may use cookies, web beacons, tags, scripts, and other automated devices to collect information, including personally identifiable information, about you when you visit our Sites and receive emails from us. Specifically, we may collect the following information about your use of our Sites via these technologies: your browser type and operating system; web pages you view; links you click; your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address; your approximate geographic location; your interaction with the Sites; length of time you are logged in to our Sites; and websites visited before or after our Sites. In some of our email messages, we use a “click-through URL” linked to content on a Site. When Consumers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the destination page on one of our Sites. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our Consumer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic links in the email messages. We also collect non-personal data (including, without limitation, of the type set forth above) from third parties. The information we collect from third parties may be combined with the information we collect. This information also may be associated with your username and combined with other information, including personally identifiable information that we collect about you. For more detailed information on our use of cookies and other tracking technologies, please see our Cookie Policy.
How do we use your information?
We may use the information that we gather about you for the following purposes:
To provide our Services to you, to communicate with you about your use of our Services and for other customer service purposes;
To provide information that you have requested to receive from us in response to your opt-in requests;
To provide our Services at the request of our Clients;
To administer activities on behalf of our Clients;
To improve our Sites and Services by providing personalized experiences, location customization, personalized help, and instructions;
For marketing and advertising purposes; for example, we may use your information to display targeted advertisements to you on our Sites and to assist us in advertising our Services on third party websites;
To send you email, follow-up questions about your activity, news and newsletters, promotions, and/or invitations to visit the Site; and
To better understand how users access and use our Sites and Services, both on an aggregated and individualized basis, and for other research purposes.
Clients should note that we may use information we receive or collect regarding Consumers in accordance with the terms of this Policy, including in the manner set forth above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in certain contexts, we collect information on behalf of our Clients subject to contractual requirements that limit our ability to use and transfer your information in ways that are more narrow than those in this Policy (e.g., the information be only used as necessary to provide Services to the Client and/or for other specified purposes). In those limited circumstances, your information is subject to those contractual requirements and not to this Policy, subject to enforcement by the applicable Client. If your information is collected on behalf of a third party, it will be evident at the time that you provide such information. This Policy does not cover our Clients’ use of your information outside of our Services. You should contact that party directly to determine if your information is subject to such limitations on uses and to ascertain how the third party will make use of your information.
When and how do we share your information?
Third Parties.  We may share your information, including personally identifiable information, with non-affiliated and affiliated third parties.
Affiliates.  We may disclose the information we collect from you to our affiliates or subsidiaries; however, if we do so, their use and disclosure of your information will be subject to this Policy.
Clients or Partners.  If you are using our Services to register for an activity or to purchase a third party product or service, we share the personal information that you provide with the applicable third parties in order to fulfill your request. You may receive communications, correspondence, emails, or direct mail from these entities; each such party operates independently from us and is not subject to this Policy but is subject to its own privacy policy. In some instances, we allow Clients to use our email system to contact Consumers, so you may receive emails from our system that originate with such Clients. Please refer to that party’s privacy policy if you have any questions about its use of your information.
Service Providers.  We may disclose the information we collect from you to third party vendors, service providers, contractors, or agents who perform functions on our behalf. For example, these providers may help us administer our Sites and Applications, manage and administer activities, or process credit card payments. These third parties have agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of or information and may be located in a location different than where we operate. Where required by law, these companies agree to only use such information for the purposes for which they have been engaged by us unless you expressly permit them to use your information for other purposes.
Other Non-Affiliated Third Parties.  We may disclose the information that we collect about you to non-affiliated third parties (with your consent, if consent is required by law), such as promotional partners and others with whom we have marketing or other relationships. Those third parties may use your information for marketing purposes, such as to market products and services that they believe would be of interest to you. We also may combine the information that we collect about you with other information that we obtain from third parties. This information may help us to determine what advertisements to direct to you, to place on our Sites, and where to advertise our Services. As discussed in the advertising section below, you have the ability to opt-out of certain uses of your information.

Those third parties may use your personal information in accordance with their own privacy policies. You will need to contact those third parties to instruct them directly regarding your preferences for the use of your personal information by them.

Strategic Partners.  We have integration relationships with third-party companies and individuals ("Partners"). These relationships extend the functionality of the Services and the Partner’s application or service ("Integrated Service") by allowing the Services and the Integrated Service to exchange Consumer data and to establish linked business processes between the two. Consumers who pay us for use of the Services and use this Integrated Service are considered customers of both Aspira and the Partner. We may share with Partners, and Partners may share with us, Consumer contact, account, financial and billing information, and business data with respect to their integrated business relationship with the Consumer. The sharing of this information allows us and the Partner to establish the identity of the shared customer and determine referral fees owed. This sharing also allows the Partner to provide consolidated billing services to the shared Consumer and allows for the enhanced functionality of the Integrated Service. Information shared for these purposes is governed by this Policy.
Affiliate and Referral Partners.  We have referral relationships with third-party companies and individuals ("Referral Partners") who refer their customers to us. We may share with Referral Partners, and Referral Partners may share with us, certain information with respect to a Consumer that is referred by us or a Referral Partner to allow us and the Referral Partner to establish the identity of the shared Consumer and determine referral fees owed.
Government Clients.  By making reservations on the Sites for campgrounds, purchasing permits, purchasing hunting or fishing licenses, or using other services provided by government entities, you consent to us sharing your personal information and public agency reservation information with the government agencies and other third parties associated with the registration, purchase, or reservation you are making or service you are using ("Government Agency Partners").

Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.
Third Party Links.  At times, our Sites and Applications may contain links to other third party websites. Any access to and use of such linked websites is not governed by this Policy, but, instead, is governed by the privacy policies of those third party websites, and we are not responsible for the information practices of such third party websites.
How secure is information about me?
We have implemented commercially reasonable precautions, including, where appropriate, password protection, encryption, and secure socket layering to protect our Sites and the information we collect from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Please be aware that despite our efforts, no data security measures can guarantee 100% security all of the time. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any of your personal information via our Sites.
You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, computer, and web-enabled devices, among other things, by signing off after using a shared computer, inserting a password on your web-enabled device, choosing a password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, keeping your password private, and periodically changing your password. You should never share your log-in information with others. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen or compromised passwords, or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity.
Can I access and modify my personal information?
Upon request, we will provide you with information about whether we hold, or process on behalf of a third party, any of your personal information.  To request this information please e-mail us at privacy@aspiraconnect.com.
If your personal information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, delete/remove, or ask to have it removed from a public forum or testimonial by making the change within your account settings or by contacting us via one of the methods listed in this Policy. We will respond to your request to access within 30 days. Please note that copies of information that you have updated, modified, or deleted may continue to reside in our systems for a period of time. In the event we are unable to complete your access request, we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why. We may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, are extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required by local law.
If your information has been shared with a third party, as described above, or collected on behalf of a Client, then that third party has received their own copy of your data. If you have been contacted by one of these third parties, or one of our Clients, and wish to correct or request they delete your information, please contact them directly.
What choices do I have regarding my information?
We may send you emails from time-to-time, for example, to ask you about an activity in which you participated. When you use our Services, you may have the option of signing up for news and offers from us or other third parties, which may include, information about activities, our newsletter or other items that we (or third parties) believe may be of interest to you.

In addition, you may still receive emails sent by our Clients through means other than our system. Further, if you opt-out of receiving information related to a particular activity, you will still receive communications from us and communications related to other activities. So you may have to unsubscribe from multiple emails before you stop receiving all communications related to activities for which you registered through our Services.

We do not recommend that you do this unless you plan to no longer use the Services. Even after you opt-out of all communications, we will retain your information in accordance with this Policy, however, we will no longer use it to contact you. However, our Clients who have received your information in accordance with this Policy may still use that information to contact you in accordance with their own privacy policies, but they may not use our system to do so.
If you would like to delete your account with us, you may do so by emailing us at info@aspiraconnect.com and specifying which account(s) to delete.
