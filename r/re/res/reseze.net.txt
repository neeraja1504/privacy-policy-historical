We guarantee that every transaction you make at ResEze.com will be 100% safe. This means you pay nothing if unauthorized charges are made to your card as a result of making a reservation on ResEze.com. See guarantee details below.
Why is ResEze.com so safe?
ResEze.com is powered by the ResEze booking engine. ResEze's secure server software (SSL) is the industry standard and among the best software available today for secure e-commerce transactions. It encrypts all of your personal information, including credit card number, name, and address, so that it cannot be read as the information travels over the Internet. In addition, ResEze.com only passes your information to our own secure servers, so that your personal information is safe throughout your visit to ResEze.com.
You can take comfort in knowing that hundreds of thousands of customers have already safely booked their rooms on the ResEze.com system without credit card fraud or any other security problems.

If your bank does hold you liable for any of this $50.00, ResEze.com will cover the entire liability for you, up to the full $50.00. ResEze.com will cover this liability only if the unauthorized use of your credit card resulted through no fault of your own from a booking made on ResEze.com while using our secure server.
