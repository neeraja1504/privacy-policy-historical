to enable us to perform our obligations under any contract with you;
processing for legitimate interests provided these are not overridden by your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms (this includes our own legitimate interests and those of other entities in the Rebrandly), in particular this is relevant when we use and process your personal data in order to respond to your enquiries and to address our good governance obligations; and
we may also disclose your personal information to governmental and regulatory bodies and other third parties where required to do so by applicable law, such as to comply with a court order or a request from a regulator or similar legal process or where otherwise necessary to comply with a legal obligation or for the administration of justice.

These other countries may either have different data protection laws than your country of residence or they may not have data protection laws. Steps will however be taken to put in place safeguards (including around security) to protect your personal data when it is in other countries.  For example, in respect of Europe, this includes use of European Model Clause contracts.  You can find out what these are online at the following address: http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/transfer/index_en.htm.

In addition, we take reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information is adequately protected in accordance with the Acts and the GDPR.
Period for which the personal data will be stored, or if that is not possible, the criteria used to determine that period
Your personal data will not be kept for longer than is necessary to fulfil the specific purposes outlined in this Privacy Statement and Cookies Policy and to allow us to comply with our legal requirements, including, without limitation, any tax and commercial obligations.

Retention in case of queries
We may retain your personal data for a reasonable period after you have enquired about Services, in case of follow up queries from you.
* **Retention in case of claims**
We may retain your personal data for the period in which you might legally bring claims against us (this means we will retain it for at least 7 years) if and to the extent this is relevant.
* **Retention in accordance with legal and regulatory requirements**
We will consider whether we need to retain your personal data after the period of retention in the case of queries or claims (above) because of a legal or regulatory requirement.

* **Retention permitted under applicable law**
We will continue to retain personal data where necessary to provide our services to you and the retention of such personal data is necessary for the purposes of pursuing our legitimate interests or where it is necessary for public interest purposes.
Please note that, although reasonable efforts will be taken, it may not always be possible to completely remove or delete all of your personal information from our databases because of back-ups and other technical reasons.  Where this is the case, we will take steps to ensure that your personal data is suppressed in order to render it unusable.
