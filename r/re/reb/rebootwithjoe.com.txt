Non-Personal Information about your use of the Reboot web site and your use of other web sites is collected through the use of Cookies and Web Beacons. “Cookies” are small data files that are stored on the hard drive of the computer you use to view a web site. Every computer that accesses the Reboot web site is assigned a unique cookie by Reboot. “Web Beacons” are graphic image files imbedded in a web page typically used to monitor activity on a web page and send back to its home server (which can belong to the host site, a network advertiser or some other third party) information from your browser, such as the IP address, the URL of the page on which the Web Beacon is located, the type browser that is accessing the site and the ID number of any Cookies on your computer previously placed by that server.
In addition, third parties under contract with Reboot may use Cookies or Web Beacons to collect Non-Personal Information about your usage of the Reboot web site. These third party advertising service providers may use this information, on our behalf, to help Reboot deliver advertising on the Reboot web site as well as on other sites on the Internet based on your browsing activity on our sites. Reboot may further tailor the advertising on these third party sites based on additional Non-Personal Information to the extent known by Reboot or these third parties.
Social Networking Sites
If you choose to use any Social Networking Sites, we may receive Personal Information from such Social Networking Sites, including, but not limited to:
Name
Nickname or Username
Email Address
Photo or Graphic Avatar
Unique Third Party Website Identifier (e.g., Facebook User ID)
Biographical or Demographic Information (e.g. professional title, gender, college attended, etc.)
Likes and Interests
Contacts / Friends / Associations
Any Information that Is Publicly Available on Third Party Websites
Reboot offers the ability to use certain Social Networking Sites to facilitate your registration on Reboot. We may also use information about your profile and connections on Social Networking Sites to allow you to share or connect with your friends and contacts on Reboot or to personalize your experience.
Your decision to use, or share with, a Social Networking Site when accessing or using the Reboot web site is completely voluntary. Reboot is not responsible for compliance with the policies or practices of any Social Networking Site. You should ensure that you are comfortable with the information such Social Networking Sites may make available to Reboot by reviewing those Social Networking Sites’ privacy policies and service terms, and by modifying your privacy settings and preferences on those web sites accordingly.
Any information we receive from Social Networking Sites will be governed by this Privacy Policy.
Reboot Apps
When you download and install a Reboot App onto your mobile device we assign a random number to your App installation. This number cannot be used to identify you personally, and we cannot identify you personally unless you choose to become a registered user of a Reboot App. We use this random number in a manner similar to our use of Cookies as described above. Unlike Cookies, the random number is assigned to your installation of an App itself and not a browser, because Apps do not work through your browser. If you do not want us to use the random number for the purposes for which we use Cookies, please do not use any Reboot Apps and please use your mobile device browser to access the Reboot web site or our mobile optimized sites. We do not obtain any information about your mobile device other than the brand, make and model and type of operating software your device uses.
Analytics Services
Reboot uses third party analytics providers and products to obtain, compile and analyze information (that may include Personal Information) about how users are using and interacting with the Reboot web site. Reboot may provide information (including Personal Information) to these analytics providers for the purpose of obtaining statistics and other information about how users are using and interacting with the Reboot web site. These analytics providers may use tracking techniques other than Cookies to recognize your computer or device and/or to collect or compile this information. These techniques may be used directly on the Reboot web site. Reboot has no responsibility for the technologies, tools or practices of the third parties that provide analytics products and services to Reboot. Please be aware that your web browser may not permit you to block the use of these techniques, and that browser settings that block conventional Cookies may have no effect on such techniques.
Non-Personal Information Collected by Third Parties Not Acting on Reboot’s Behalf
We work with third parties to display advertising that reflects the interests and preferences of our users. Sponsors or advertisers on the Reboot web site may use their own Cookies, Web Beacons or other online tracking technologies in the banner advertisements served on the Reboot web site and in emails, special promotions, Daily Posts or Newsletters we send you. Their advertisements may be displayed on the Reboot web site or on other sites that you visit after you visit the Reboot web site. Some advertisers use companies other than Reboot to serve their ads and to monitor users’ responses to ads, and these companies (“Ad Servers”) may also collect Non-Personal Information through the use of Cookies or Web Beacons on the Reboot web site.
We do not control how third parties use Cookies or Web Beacons or how they manage the Non-Personal Information they gather through the use of these technologies on the Reboot web site. However, we do require sponsors, advertisers and Ad Servers who collect Cookie or Web Beacon information through the Reboot web site to agree that they will not collect any Personal Information from the Reboot web site without your consent. They have promised us they will not link any Non-Personal Information collected by them on the Reboot web site to Personal Information they or others collect in other ways or from other sites.
Personal Health Information
In connection with certain services offered by Reboot, we may request information regarding your health history. To the extent we collect any personal health information, we will comply with all applicable laws and regulations relating to the privacy and security requirements for such information. While we will work to maintain the privacy of all health information that you may provide to us, Reboot is currently not subject to the privacy and security requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) or any other laws applicable to medical professionals and health care providers (or other “covered entities”).

Remarketing on Third Party Web Sites
Reboot employs interest-based advertising, including retargeting or remarketing technology provided by third parties (“Third Party Providers”), to advertise Reboot goods and services across the Internet. Such Third Party Providers include:
Criteo SA,
Facebook, Inc.,
Google Adwords, a service of Google Inc.,
Instagram LLC, and
Twitter Inc.
This is how such technology works: such Third Party Providers use Cookies to track which parts of the Reboot web site you have viewed. Then, using the Non-Personal Information obtained through those Cookies, third party vendors (e.g., Google) display Reboot ads specifically tailored to you on third party web sites that you visit. This way, we are able to advertise Reboot goods and services in a way that best suits your specific needs.
If you do not wish such Third Party Providers to collect any such information from you, you can use each Third Party Provider’s opt-out function set forth below:

Research and Measurement Activities
Information that Reboot collects about you may be combined by Reboot with other information available to Reboot through third parties for research and measurement purposes, including measuring the effectiveness of content, advertising or programs.
