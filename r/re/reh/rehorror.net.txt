Webmaster/Owner I got into Horror due to Resident Evil and had a fansite called "Resident Evil Horror" for almost 10 years. In late 2009, i decided to open the gates for other horror aswell. Here we are in 2011, Rely on Horror, trying hard to offer the best content in horror entertainment with a strong focus on games. I hope you enjoy your stay! ~ Dominik Mayr
