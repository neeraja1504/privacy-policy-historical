Z-Ben Advisors is committed to protecting the privacy of the users (“you”, “your”) of this site (“Web Site”). We collect personally identifiable information about you only with your permission.
Collection of personal information: In some cases, such as to participate in surveys, apply for employment or to contact us through our Web Site, we ask you for personal information. The information collected is related to the purpose, and includes your name, contact information, and (if applying for employment), relevant information about your occupations.
Security: We will use appropriate, commercially reasonable safeguards to maintain the confidentiality of your personal information. We will take appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information against (a) accidental or unlawful destruction, (b) accidental loss and (c) unauthorized alteration, disclosure or access. Any data we collect may be transferred internationally throughout Z-Ben Advisors for the purposes for which it was collected.
Customization: Some areas of the Web Site can be customized according to user preferences. We use individual preferences to deliver custom content online and analyze aggregate preferences in order to improve site quality.
Publication orders: If a user orders a publication, their personal information will be used to fulfill the order, and may be shared with third parties involved in fulfilling the order (a printer, for instance).
E-mail: If you send an e-mail message to us, we will use your e-mail address and other information you provide to respond to your request.

We do use persistent cookies to identify users who take advantage of the customization features of the site and to save this identification between site visits.
Third parties: We do not sell or share personal information with third parties for their own separate use. Rather, data may be shared with third parties retained by Z-Ben Advisors for purposes of fulfilling their obligations to Z-Ben Advisors only.
