Privacy Policy
Last Updated October 19, 2018
The University of Redlands (“University”) is committed to ensuring the privacy of confidential information, accuracy of personal data, and compliance with international, federal, and state laws and regulations concerning the use of personal information. Other than as required or permitted by law, Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) is not shared. In particular, and regardless of how the information was collected, the University does not sell PII and it does not re-distribute PII for any non-University purpose.
Information Collected
The University collects and processes PII from individuals only as necessary in the exercise of the University's legitimate mission, interests, functions, and responsibilities as a private, non-profit institution of higher education. The majority of PII comes from students (and members of their families), employees, alumni, friends, and people who apply to be students or employees.
Use of Collected Information
PII collected from students or student applicants is used to register or enroll persons in the University, provide and administer housing to students, manage student accounts, provide academic advising, develop and deliver education programs, track academic progress, analyze and improve education programs, recruitment, retention, regulatory reporting, auditing, maintenance of accreditation, and other related University processes and functions. The University also uses PII to conduct general demographic and statistical research to improve University programs, to identify appropriate support services or activities, provide reasonable accommodations, enforce University policies, or comply with applicable laws. The University collects and processes PII from individuals who are employees or applicants for employment for the purpose of administering various employment benefits and functions.  The University also collects and processes PII from alumni, donors, parents, and friends of the University to advance the University’s mission.  PII may be shared by the University with third parties who have entered into contracts to perform functions on behalf of the University, but only when the third parties agree to protect PII and prevent unauthorized disclosure.
Distribution of Collected Information
The University will not disclose PII, without consent, except for certain explicit circumstances in which disclosure is permitted or required by law. Additionally, the University will not sell PII to third-party organizations for any non-University purpose.
Third Party Use of Personal Information
The University may disclose PII and other information as follows:
Consent:  We may disclose information if we have an individual’s consent to do so.
Emergency Circumstances:  We may share information when necessary to protect health and safety interests, even if an individual is physically or legally incapable of providing consent.
Employment:  We may share information when necessary for administering employment or social security benefits in accordance with applicable law, subject to the imposition of appropriate safeguards to prevent unauthorized disclosure.
Public Information:  We may share information if the information already has been made public.
Archiving:  We may share information for archival purposes in the public interest, and for historical research and statistical purposes.
Performance of a Contract:  We may share information when necessary to comply with a contractual obligation.
Legal Obligation:  We may share information when the disclosure is required or permitted by international, federal, or state laws and regulations. The University will comply with lawfully-issued subpoenas.
Service Providers:  We use third parties who have entered into a contract with the University to support the administration of University operations. In such cases, we share information with such third parties subject to the imposition of appropriate safeguards to prevent unauthorized disclosure.
University-Affiliated Individuals, Programs, and Services:  We may share information with individuals and other third parties that are affiliated with the University for the purpose of contacting you about goods, services, charitable giving or experiences that may be of interest to you. This information is made available on the condition that it is used only for the purposes for which it was shared, is kept confidential, and is safeguarded from unauthorized disclosure.
De-Identified and Aggregate Information:  We may use and disclose information in de-identified or aggregate form without limitation.
Notification of Changes
The University Privacy Policy is reviewed periodically and may be modified at the discretion of the University. Changes to the privacy policy will be incorporated and posted on the University’s web site. Information will be handled according to the privacy policy in effect at the time the information is used.

STUDENTS PRIVACY NOTICE
Student Records
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (“FERPA”) protects the privacy of students’ educational records. Access to academic and disciplinary records is limited to students, dependent students’ parents, and authorized school officials.
For more information on FERPA, please visit The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act web site.
No one outside the University shall have access to, nor will the University disclose any information from students' education records, without the consent of students.
The following exceptions are permitted under FERPA.
to certain officials of the University to officials of other institutions in which students seek to enroll
to persons or organizations providing students financial aid
to accrediting agencies carrying out their accreditation function
to persons in compliance with a judicial order
to persons in an emergency in order to protect the health or safety of students or other persons
in accordance with the Solomon Amendment (requiring the disclosure of certain information to military recruiters)
Within the University, only those officials, individually or collectively, acting in the students' legitimate educational interests are permitted access to student education records. A “legitimate educational interest” will be present if the school official needs to review an education record to fulfill the official’s professional responsibility.
"Disclosure" means to permit access to or the release, transfer or other communication of education records, or the personally identifiable information contained in those records, to any party, by any means, including oral, written or electronic means.
Directory Information
The University maintains student records in compliance with FERPA, which assures students and parents of their right to privacy of information. The University further complies with the California Education Code, sections 22509 through 22509.18, which state that the management of student records shall be a matter of Federal and State law and regulation.
The following is considered directory information and may be released or published without the student's consent:
Student name, date and place of birth; major field of study; dates of attendance; degrees, honor and awards received; most recent educational institution attended; campus address and telephone number and student assigned e-mail; home address and telephone number; cell phone number; participation in special academic programs; participation in recognized student activities; participation in officially recognized sports; class level, weight and height of athletic team members.
Students who wish directory information to be withheld from all individuals outside the University must sign a request in the Registrar's Office.
Release of Academic Information
Confidential information is defined as any information contained in a student education record not included in "Directory Information".  The University respects the privacy rights of all students.  Students need to be aware that, under FERPA regulations, the University is permitted to disclose student education records to parents without the student’s specific consent if a student is a “dependent” (generally, by being designated as such on a parent’s federal tax form).  Students or parents who wish for the University to exercise this permission should make a written request and submit proof of dependency to the Registrar’s Office.
The University will not release confidential information for independent students (students over the age of 23, or "independent" as defined by University Financial Aid Policy) without written request of the student.
The student has the right to restrict disclosure/release of directory information to third-parties.
Online Release of Information Forms
Student-Initiated Authorization for Release of Information
Parent-Initiated Authorization for Release of Information
Transcripts
An official transcript of a student's academic record is issued only upon the student's written, signed request. Transcripts submitted to the University for admission or credit transfer become the property of the University and cannot be returned to the student, copied or forwarded to other institutions.
Review of Academic Records
FERPA provides students with the right to inspect and review information contained in their education records, to challenge the contents of their education records, to have a hearing if the outcome of a challenge is unsatisfactory, and to submit explanatory statements for inclusion in their files if they feel the decisions of the hearing panels are unacceptable. Note: a) The Registrar coordinates the inspection and review procedures for student education records, which include admissions, personal, academic, and cooperative education records; b) the Financial Aid Officer coordinates the inspection and review procedures for financial aid files; c) the Office of Business and Finance coordinates the inspection and review procedures for financial and billing files.
Students wishing to review their education records must make written requests to the Registrar’s Office, or other appropriate campus official, listing the item or items of interest. Only records covered by FERPA will be made available within forty-five days of the request. Students may have copies made of their records with certain exceptions (for example a copy of an academic record for which a financial "hold" exists, or a transcript of an original or source document which exists elsewhere). These copies will be made at the students' expense at prevailing rates which are listed in the catalog.
Students have the right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by University to comply with the requirements of FERPA.
