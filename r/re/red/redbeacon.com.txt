INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE
Information Collected Upon Visiting. When you visit the Applications, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website ("Log Data"). This Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type or the domain from which you are visiting, the web-pages you visit, the search terms you use, and any advertisements or links on which you click. For most users accessing the Internet from an Internet service provider the IP address will be different every time you log on. We use Log Data to monitor the use of the Applications and of our Service, and for the Applications's technical administration.
Information Collected Upon Registration. If you desire to have access to certain restricted sections of the Applications, you will be required to become a registered user, and to submit certain personally identifiable information to Pro Referral. This happens in a number of instances, such as when you sign up for the Pro Referral service, if you desire to receive marketing materials and information, if you submit a Service Request, and/or if you create a Skill Profile to offer services through Pro Referral. Personally identifiable information that we may collect in such instances may include your full name, password, email address, street address, telephone number, mobile phone number for text messages, photographs you upload, and other information that you decide to provide us with, or that you decide to include in your public profile. If you register as a Pro, create a Skill Profile, and/or Quote on a Service Request, we may request and store your credit card number and other personally identifiable information.
Business Information. If you create a Skill Profile, you have the opportunity to provide additional information ("Business Information") such as your business name, logo or avatar, credentials and qualifications, year of business establishment, as well as links to your personal web site, if you have one. You may also upload a photograph portfolio of your previous work. We may supplement or modify the Business Information to conform to our editorial policies or to add information from your website, materials that you supply to us, or publicly available sources. When you respond to a Consumer's Service Request, all of the Business Information is displayed to the Consumer making such Service Request. Providing additional information beyond what is required at registration is entirely optional, but may enable you market your services more effectively and potentially win more jobs on the Applications.
If you contact us by email through the Applications, we may keep a record of your contact information and correspondence, and use such information to respond to your inquiry.
Survey. We may also collect information if you participate in surveys conducted by or on behalf of us or our partner companies, including but not limited to questionnaires, telephone interview and/or discussion groups, and otherwise providing general information about the Pro Referral service.
Anonymous Data. We may create Anonymous Data records from information collected from you (such as information contained in a Service Request) by excluding information (such as your full name) that make the data personally identifiable to you. "Anonymous Data" means data that is not associated with or linked to your personal information; Anonymous Data does not permit the identification of individual persons. We reserve the right to use and disclose Anonymous Data to third parties in our discretion.
