EXERCISING YOUR RIGHTS AND CHOICES

Calling us at 1-800-261-0326
Emailing us at dataprivacy@redwingshoes.com.
Clicking on the DO NOT SELL MY PERSONAL INFORMATION link at the bottom of the webpage.
Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your Personal Information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.
You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period.
The verifiable consumer request must:
Provide sufficient information to allow us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative, which may include:
For non-sensitive information with a low risk of harm: Matching at least two data points you provide with information we hold.
For sensitive information with a high risk of harm: Matching at least three pieces of Personal Information you provide with Personal Information we hold.
A signed declaration under penalty of perjury from you stating that you are the consumer whose Personal Information is the subject of the request.
Describe your request with sufficient detail to allow us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to your request.
We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to you.
Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.
We will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.

We will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.
Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.

Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time.
