This Safe Harbor Privacy Policy (the "Policy") sets forth the privacy principles that the Company follows with respect to personal information transferred from the European Union (EU) and Switzerland to the United States.
1.   Safe Harbor Compliancy Affirmative Statement for U.S.-E.U and U.S.-Swiss Framework
Valassis Communications, Inc. complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. Valassis has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view Valassis's certification, please visit http://www.export.gov/safeharbor
2.   Scope
The U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Commission have agreed on a set of data protection principles and frequently asked questions (the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework) to enable U.S. companies to satisfy the requirement under European Union law that adequate protection be given to personal information transferred from the EU to the United States. The U.S. Department of Commerce and the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner of Switzerland have agreed on a similar set of data protection principles and frequently asked questions (the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework). Consistent with its commitment to protect personal privacy, the Company adheres to the respective Safe Harbor Principles. The Policy applies to all personal information received by the Company in the United States from the European Union and Switzerland.
For additional information regarding the Safe Harbor Program, see the U.S. Dept. of Commerce web site at http://www.export.gov/safeharbor.
3.   Privacy Principles
The privacy principles in this Policy are based on the Safe Harbor Principles.
4.   Notice
Where the Company collects personal information directly from individuals in the EU and Switzerland, it will inform them about the type of personal information collected, the purposes for which it collects and uses the personal information, and the types of non-agent third parties to which the Company discloses or may disclose that information to, and the choices and means, if any, the Company offers individuals for limiting the use and disclosure of their personal information. Notice will be provided in clear and conspicuous language when individuals are first asked to provide personal information to the Company, or as soon as practicable thereafter, and in any event before the Company uses or discloses the information for a purpose other than that for which it was originally collected.
5.   Choice
The Company will offer individuals the opportunity to choose (opt-out) whether their personal information is to be disclosed to a non-agent third party or to be used for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual.
For sensitive personal information, the Company will give individuals the opportunity to affirmatively and explicitly (opt-in) consent to the disclosure of the information to a non-agent third party or the use of the information for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual.
6.   Onward Transfer
The Company only transfers Personal Data to a service provider, vendor or other third party acting as a processor of Personal Data for the Company (an "agent") where the agent has provided assurances that said agent provides at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by these privacy principles. Where the Company has knowledge that one of its agents is using or sharing Personal Data in a way that is contrary to these principles, the Company will take reasonable and appropriate steps to prevent or stop such processing. The Company will only transfer Personal Data to a non-agent third party where such transfer is consistent with applicable laws and with the notice provided to the data owners at the time the Personal Data were collected.
7.   Security
The Company takes reasonable precautions to protect EU and Swiss Personal Data in its possession to prevent loss, misuse, disclosure, unauthorized access, alteration or destruction.
8.   Data Integrity
Personal information collected will only be processed in a way that is compatible and relevant for the purposes for which it is to be used. To the extent necessary for those purposes, the Company will take reasonable steps to ensure the data is accurate, complete, current and reliable for its intended use.
9.   Access
Upon request, data subjects will have access to their EU or Swiss Personal Data held by the Company and may correct, amend, or delete their Personal Data if it is inaccurate. However, access to such EU or Swiss Personal Data may be denied, when the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the data subject's privacy in the case in question, or where the rights of persons other than the data subjects would be violated.
10.   Enforcement
The Company will internally assess the Policies and their practices to ensure continuous compliance with the Safe Harbor frameworks. Any Company employee found to have violated the privacy principles in this Safe Harbor Statement will be subject to appropriate corrective actions up to and including termination of employment.

Any questions or concerns regarding the use or disclosure of personal information should be directed to the Companies' Privacy Office at the address given below.
