Privacy
Privacy Policy and Terms
This following privacy policy applies for the website RedIce.tv not redicemembers.com which is a separate website that offers a paid subscription service.
Information We Collect & How We Use It
Since RedIce.tv does not offer an account, registration, newsletter or paid subscription service, we do not collect any personal information other than non-personally-identifying information for website statistical data. This type of information is the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available such as your browser type, language preference, referring site, IP address and the date and time of each visitor request. We may also track action types, such as a specific URL, radio show or download. Tracking key performance indicators such as visits, downloads, referrals and keywords can lead to an understanding of which pages are more relevant to visitors than others. We analyze website data to better understand how our visitor's use our website.
RedIce.tv is not affiliated or working with advertisers, sponsors, marketers or information aggregators. We do not share data and information with any third party service.
How We Collect Â Information
We use Piwik, an open analytics platform that is privacy compliant and ensures the privacy of our users and analytics data. The Center for Data Privacy Protection in France (CNIL) recommended Piwik as the only tool that can easily ensure full compliance with privacy regulations. In July 2014 the French CNIL recommends Piwik as the only analytics tool that does not require Cookie Consent.
Piwik privacy compliance is also reflected by the many government agencies who already trust and rely on Piwik such as in Europe, Asia and North America for providing self-hosted web analytics.
RedIce.tv retains control of all data, which is stored in our own database, and logs or reports will never be sent to other servers by Piwik. This information is only available to our administrator.
