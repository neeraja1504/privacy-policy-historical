Redfin Privacy Policy
Effective Date: January 31, 2019
This Privacy Policy applies to Personal Information processed by Redfin in the course of our business, including, Redfin.com, Redfin.ca, the Redfin Applications (each a " Site ") and the services provided through the Sites (collectively with the Sites, the " Services "). The terms " Redfin ," " we ," " us ," and " our " includes Redfin Corporation and our affiliates and subsidiaries (including, without limitation, Redfin Unlimited Liability Company for individuals located in Canada).
Please note that unless we define a term in this Privacy Policy, capitalized terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms of Use.
This Privacy Policy contains the following sections:
1. Information Collection and Use
2. Information Sharing
3. Your Choices
4. Individual Rights in Personal Information
5. Information Retention
6. Information Storage and Security
7. Other Important Information
1. Information Collection and Use
This Privacy Policy covers our use of Personal Information. When we say " Personal Information ," we mean information that relates to you and can – either on its own or in combination with other information – identify you as an individual. Personal information does not include information that has been de-identified or aggregated such that you can no longer be identified.
The types of information we collect depends on your level of engagement with the Services. The more you interact with the Services, the more information we need to provide the Services. This Section explains how we collect and use information based on your level of engagement with the Services.
A. All Users of the Redfin Sites
From registered and unregistered users of the Sites, we automatically receive and record information whenever you interact with the Sites. This includes IP address data from our server logs, cookie information, browser information, information about your activity while on the Sites (such as the pages you request, properties that you view or save, and property that you claim), and the URL of the site you came to the Sites from. We also may collect the mobile device ID (such as the ID for Advertising on iOS and Android ID on Android) from users of the Redfin Applications. If permitted by the settings on your device and with your consent, we will also collect your geo-location information. We use this to provide you with location specific information, such as homes for sale near your current location as determined by your geolocation, and information about listing your home for sale based on your geolocation. We may also approximate your location based off your IP address.
We may also use the information listed above to help diagnose problems and performance with the Services, analyze trends, customize your experience, and administer the Services. We may provide IP addresses to third-parties to help us analyze website user survey data. We may also use the information described in this section to better target information about Redfin's Sites and Services, for example, by displaying more accurate or relevant information on our Sites, matching you to a public record listing of a property, tailoring the advertising we display on third party websites and platforms, and sending better targeted and tailored messages, including via email and/or push notifications.
B. Registered Users of the Redfin Sites
We are required to collect certain information, including your name and email address, as a condition of our licenses with the multiple real estate listing services (the " MLSs ") in order to allow you to access the full MLS listings. You give us this information when you create your Redfin account. When you give us this information at one of our events, or upon your request, we will create a Redfin account for you and you agree that this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use apply. In addition, when you are signed in to your Redfin account and using Redfin through Facebook, Twitter, or any other third-party authorization service, we may make use of the information that they provide us to further customize your Redfin experience. We may share Personal Information with such third parties to deliver tailored content both on our Services and on third party sites (e.g., social media sites).
My Redfin : My Redfin is a feature that allows you to upload notes and photos about a property, save searches, add favorites and x-outs, and otherwise organize homes that may interest you. We save all of this "My Redfin" information for your use later. It is stored with your Redfin account information.
Account Password Security : Your Redfin account password is encrypted on our server. It is your responsibility not to disclose your password to other people, and to ensure you maintain its security.
Account Updates : By visiting your My Redfin: Account Settings, you can correct, amend, add or delete Personal Information associated with your account. However, even after you update information, we may maintain a copy of the original information in our records.
C. Home Tours, Real Estate Classes, and other In-Person Meetings
When you submit a home tour request, we will ask for your tour date and time preferences, as well as your phone number. We may ask for similar information when you request or attend a home buying or selling class, or when you request or attend a strategy session or similar in-person meeting with a Redfin agent. We may also ask some questions so that our agent can verify your identity, and such information will be used to register you for a Redfin account. When you meet up with one of our agents, the agent may ask you to verify your identity, and may even ask to see a photo ID.
D. Redfin Clients
When you are getting ready to buy or sell a home and you start working with our coordinators and agents, you become a Redfin client. As part of the home purchase or sale process, you will need to provide a lot of information as is customary for a home purchase or sale transaction. This information can include, without limitation, your name, address, phone number, email address, financial or payment information, including without limitation, buyer loan pre-approval documentation and seller property information. We ask you, as a buyer, for loan pre-approvals from a mortgage broker or lender to determine which homes are in your price range, and to help you make an offer more quickly when you do find a home. You, as a seller, may be legally required to disclose certain information about your property to prospective buyers. Once you sign a listing agreement or buyer agreement with us, your relationship with Redfin is governed by that agreement, as well as our online Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy.
E. Communications with Redfin
Redfin may collect Personal Information from you such as email address, phone number, or mailing address when you request information about our Services, register for our newsletter, request customer or technical support, or otherwise communicate with us.
F. Marketing
We may send marketing materials to Redfin account holders and clients using various communication channels, including without limitation, email, text messages/SMS, push notifications, telephone calls, and direct mail. Individuals may also subscribe to Listing Alert Emails or other notifications with information such as customized summaries of homes for sale. If you opt-in to also receive marketing messages, Redfin may send you Redfin-related news and surveys.
G. Call Recording
We may record any telephone calls between you and our agents or other representatives for training and quality assurance purposes.
H. Surveys
Redfin may contact you to participate in surveys. If you decide to participate, you may be asked to provide certain information which may include Personal Information.
I. Sharing with Friends or Colleagues
Redfin's Services may allow you to forward or share certain content with a friend or colleague, such as an email inviting your friend to use our Services. Email addresses that you may provide for a friend or colleague will be used to send your friend or colleague the content or link you request.
J. Interactive Features
Redfin may offer interactive features such as chat services, forums, and social media pages. We may collect the information you submit or make available through these features. Any content you provide on the public sections of these channels will be considered "public" and will not be subject to the privacy protections referenced herein.
K. De-Identified and Aggregated Information
We may use Personal Information and other information about you to create de-identified and/or aggregated information, such as de-identified demographic information, de-identified location information, de-identified or aggregated trends, reports, or statistics, information about the computer or device from which you access our Services, or other analyses we create. De-identified and aggregated information is used for a variety of functions, including the measurement of visitors' interest in and use of various portions or features of the Sites and Services. De-identified and aggregated information is not Personal Information, and we may use and disclose such information in a number of ways, including research, internal analysis, analytics, and any other legally permissible purpose.
L. Conferences and Trade Shows

This information may include your Internet protocol (IP) address, user settings, IMEI, MAC address, cookie identifiers, mobile carrier, mobile advertising and other unique identifiers, details about your browser, operating system or device, location information, Internet service provider, pages that you visit before, during and after using the Services, information about the links you click, and other information about how you use the Services. Information we collect may be associated with accounts and other devices.
N. Cookies and Pixel Tags/Web Beacons
We, as well as third parties that provide content, advertising, or other functionality on the Services, may use cookies, pixel tags, local storage, and other technologies (" Technologies ") to automatically collect information through the Services. Technologies are essentially small data files placed on your computer, tablet, mobile phone, or other devices that allow us to record certain pieces of information whenever you visit or interact with our Sites and Services.
Cookies. Cookies are small text files placed in visitors' device browsers to store their preferences. Most browsers allow you to block and delete cookies. However, if you do that, the Services may not work properly.
Pixel Tags/Web Beacons. A pixel tag (also known as a web beacon) is a piece of code embedded on the Sites that collects information about users' engagement on that web page. The use of a pixel allows us to record, for example, that a user has visited a particular web page or clicked on a particular advertisement.
You may stop or restrict the placement of Technologies on your device or remove them by adjusting your preferences as your browser or device permits.
O. Information from Other Sources
We may obtain information about you from other sources, including through third-party services and organizations to supplement information provided by you. This supplemental information allows us to verify information that you have provided to us and to enhance our ability to provide you with the Services.
P. Other Uses of Information
We may use any of the Personal Information we collect for the following purposes:
to operate our Sites and provide our Services in accordance with our Terms of Use and/or any other agreement you may have with us;
to respond to your questions or inquiries;
to conduct promotional activities, including contests;
to undertake internal research for technological development and demonstration;
to improve, upgrade or enhance our Sites and Services;
to send you informational or promotional communications that you have agreed to receive;
to carry out other purposes that are disclosed to you and to which you consent;
to detect security incidents (including to protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, and prosecute those responsible for that activity);
to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality;
to undertake activities to verify or maintain the quality or safety of a Service;
to pursue our legitimate interests where your rights and freedoms do not outweigh these interests; and
to carry out automated decision making and/or profiling. We will not make automated decisions about you that would significantly affect you, unless such a decision is necessary as part of a contract we have with you, we have your consent, or we are required by law to do so.
2. Information Sharing
We may share your Personal Information as set forth below:
A. Public Record Information : Please be aware that home sales and purchases may be a matter of public record, and your name and address, the price you paid, your property taxes, and other information may be available from public sites regardless of the brokerage(s), if any, who assist in the transaction. We post on our Sites some information that typically becomes part of the public record of a home sale or purchase.
B. Non-Public Record Information : We share information obtained from you, MLSs and other third party sources that is not on the public record to facilitate your home purchase or sale transaction. This includes:
Service Providers to all Redfin Clients : Our agents work with third parties to process your home search and sale transaction, and must share your information with those third parties. Examples include MLSs and providers of software used for document preparation and electronic signing.
Partner Agents : A Partner Agent is employed by or works with another brokerage and is not a representative or employee of Redfin. Partner Agents have contracted with us to provide Redfin-quality service to a wider range of customers. We'll refer you to a Partner Agent in our discretion. If you are referred to a Partner Agent for your home purchase or sale transaction, we share your information with that Partner Agent so they can assist you. Redfin is not responsible for the work performed or the services provided by Partner Agents in any manner.
Home Seller Service Providers : As is customary as your home sales agent, we share your listing information with MLSs and other listing websites, such as Realtor.com, Trulia.com and Zillow.com. As a result, your listing may appear on more than one website. We may also share your listing and contact information with listing vendors such as photographers, home staging experts and home repair professionals like plumbers and electricians, as needed.
Home Buyer Service Providers : As is customary as your home purchase agent, we must share your buying information with inspectors, title companies, escrow agents, closing attorneys, lenders, and other third parties as needed to process your transaction.
Potential Buyers : By law, we are required to disclose certain information about your property to potential buyers.
C. Negotiations : We also post price offers and counteroffers on our Sites. We do not post your name on our Sites without your permission but if the sale is closed, the price and the fact that you bought or sold your house at that price may be a matter of public record.

Redfin Corporate Family: We may share your information with members of the Redfin family of entities for various purposes, including to: (i) provide the Services to you; (ii) help detect and prevent potentially illegal and fraudulent acts and other violations of our policies and agreements; (iii) help with marketing initiatives; and (iii) manage and improve Redfin products, Sites, Services and tools.
E. Redfin Requests: Through the Services, you can make a request to tour a home, get in contact with a real estate agent, receive help selling or buying a home, or submit other requests.

This practice is commonly referred to as "interest-based advertising" or "online behavioral advertising." These advertising networks track your online activities over time by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of Technologies (e.g., cookies, web-beacons and other methods). This allows Redfin to target our advertising to you through demographic, behavioral and contextual means. As a result, you may see ads for Redfin on other websites and social media.
I. APIs and SDKs: We may use third party APIs and software development kits (" SDKs ") as part of the functionality of our Services.

J. Information Disclosed in Connection with Business Transactions: If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing due diligence, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, purchase or sale of assets, or transition of service to another provider, then your information may be sold or transferred as part of such a transaction as permitted by law and/or contract.
K. Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others: We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials or private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate: (i) to respond to claims or legal processes (including subpoenas); (ii) to protect our property, rights and safety and the property, rights and safety of a third party or the public in general; and (iii) to stop any activity that we consider illegal, unethical or legally actionable.
