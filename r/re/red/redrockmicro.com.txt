Redrock Respects Your Privacy
Redrock respects your privacy and works hard to safeguard the privacy of your personal data. We realize that the exciting growth of the Internet and online services raises questions concerning the nature, use and confidentiality of information collected about consumers. We want you to know that we apply our long-standing commitment to safeguarding privacy to our online and Internet activities.
Personal Identification Information
Redrock does not share, disclose or sell any personal identification information (such as your name, address, telephone number or e-mail address) collected online on the Redrock and mcro35 web site with other unaffiliated companies or organizations for non-Redrock marketing purposes.
How We Use Information
Like most businesses today, Redrock uses vendors and/or service providers to carry out certain functions in marketing and delivering services to you and so shares online data with those vendors to the extent necessary for them to perform their work. Of course, such partners and vendors must use that personal identification information only for the purpose(s) for which it was shared and protect it from any further use.
How We Collect Information
Cookies: Redrock may also use "cookies" and similar technology to obtain information about your visits to our sites or your responses to e-mail from us - both individually and in aggregated data that does not identify you. These reporting tools tell us the parts of our web sites or e-mails in which you showed an interest or took some action, and help us improve the quality and usefulness of our sites. Redrock primarily uses cookies to determine what services or promotions you are interested in. While cookies help us improve your experience while visiting our sites and customize our communications to the services you may desire, you have the option to block them through your Internet browser or other commercially available software. However, doing so may make some of our site features unavailable to you.
Web Beacons: We (or service providers on our behalf) may collect information from visits to the Site through the use of "Web Beacons." Web Beacons are web page elements which may employ cookie technology that enable us to record data about visits to or transactions made on the Site. This information is sometimes known as "clickstream data." We may use this data to analyze trends and statistics to improve your online experience or our customer service. No Personal Information is collected through the use of Web Beacons on the Site.
Security
We use encryption, firewalls and other technology and security procedures to help protect the accuracy and security of your personal information and prevent unauthorized access or improper use. For example, you will note that while using some features of the Redrock web site and online services, you will need to submit a password or some other type of authenticating information.
