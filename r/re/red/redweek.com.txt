Privacy Policy | RedWeek
Version 4 (Posted June 29, 2015) / see version 4 changes
We have created this privacy policy to demonstrate our commitment to the privacy of our users. The following discloses our information gathering and usage practices.
Privacy of user information
We do not sell, rent, or give away user information except in cases where you specifically request it. By purchasing any RedWeek Full Service Product, you agree to allow RedWeek representatives to communicate with your resort (and/or the resort management company) on your behalf, to confirm details of your ownership.
Occasionally we may run promotions in partnership with third parties where you will be given the option to receive more information. In this case, we will provide your contact information to the third party to follow through on your request. You will never be tricked into signing up for anything. Options to receive more information will always be clearly explained to you and your participation in any promotion is strictly optional.
If you add a posting to RedWeek.com, your contact information will not be made public, unless you choose to enter additional contact information into the Details section. Otherwise, RedWeek.com members will contact you via the form on your posting page, which will deliver the correspondence to the e-mail address you have provided us with. Your e-mail address will not be exposed to the member who contacted you until you reply. If you send an inquiry through RedWeek.com, the person you contacted will have your e-mail address for further direct correspondence.

Google does not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google.
