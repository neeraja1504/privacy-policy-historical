We respect your privacy
At Red Lion Controls we value our customers and their privacy. All personal information is used by our staff and authorized distributors to help customers fulfill their needs, ensuring efficiency in processing your orders. Personal information is information about identifiable individuals as defined by applicable law. Red Lion never sells, loans or rents out any personal information to any third party unless we are legally required to do so or with your written authorization. We may share your personal information with:
Spectris Group companies or non-Spectris companies that provide services to Spectris companies and certain other third parties, but only where they offer adequate protection for your information and, in certain cases, only where you have provided your consent.
In some cases, this may involve transferring your personal information to other countries (including the U.K., the U.S., Canada and other countries inside and outside the European Economic Area) where Spectris or non-Spectris companies or other third parties operate and process your personal information.
Precautions are taken to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline. We use the industry-standard security protocol Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to encode sensitive information, such as credit card numbers for online purchase transactions, that passes between you and www.redlion.net. We employ the latest 128-bit encryption technology in all areas of the site, which require you to provide personal or account information. This means that the credit card information you send is encrypted by your computer, and then decrypted again on our side, preventing others from accessing your private information in between. You can verify this by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web browser or looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the web page.
While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.
