We may also disclose your personal information where you have consented to us doing so. Your consent to the disclosure of your personal information may be given explicitly such as in writing, or verbally, or may be implied from your conduct such as when you discuss details of the relationship you have with us publicly with the media.
Additionally, your personal information may be disclosed to any regulatory or sporting body in connection with policing the integrity or enforcing the rules of a sport or game and/or for the prevention and detection of crime and with parties with whom Redbet has agreements from time to time for the sharing of such data and where Redbet considers that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that you may be involved in a breach of such rules or the law, have knowledge of a breach of such rules or the law or otherwise pose a threat to the integrity of the relevant sport or game. Those bodies may then use your personal information to investigate and act on any such breaches in accordance with their procedures.
