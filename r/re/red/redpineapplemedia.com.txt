Thereafter we must also store some of your data for purposes of book-keeping. We have an obligation to do so under statutory duties of documentation which may arise under the German Commercial Code, the German Tax Code, the German Credit and Loans Act, the German Money Laundering Act, and the German Securities Act. The periods stipulated there for storage of documents are two to ten years.
