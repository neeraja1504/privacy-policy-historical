Personal Information
Personal information is information about an identifiable individual, for example, their name, date of birth and email address. Personal information also encompasses personal health information, such as your medical records and other information about your health and your prescriptions, that has been collected or generated by your pharmacist.
Consent __
You agree that we may collect, use and disclose your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Statement.
Rexall will collect, use and disclose personal information without your consent only in limited circumstances as permitted by law. There have always been, and may continue to be, instances where we may collect, use and disclose your personal information without your consent. These instances are permitted under privacy legislation in order to ensure that the consent requirement is not a hindrance to your health and safety. For example:
- personal information may be collected without consent where the collection is clearly in the interest of the individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way;
- personal information may be used without consent where it is used for the purpose of acting in respect to an emergency that threatens the life, health or security of an individual; and
- personal information may be disclosed without consent where the disclosure is made to a person who needs the information because of an emergency that threatens the life, health or security of an individual.
Other than described directly above, we will not collect, use or disclose your personal information for new purposes, unrelated to the purposes described in this Privacy Statement, without first obtaining your prior consent.
If you choose to later withdraw your consent to allow us to collect your personal information, we will still be obliged to comply with all the provincial laws that require us to keep records relating to the medication that we dispense to you. If you chose to not give us consent to disclose certain personal information, we may not be able to provide you with the full range of pharmacy services. For example, if you indicate to the pharmacy staff that you do not consent to communications with your insurance company, you may be required to pay for your prescription and send the information required for reimbursement directly to your pharmacy benefits plan.

We will maintain a record of your instructions. Simply contact your pharmacy and they will be pleased to update this information.
(ii) Information We Collect Online
With respect to the Sites and Applications, in addition to the personal information that you provide to us with your account registration and the personal information that has already been collected by your pharmacist, we have access to the following categories of information regarding you and your visit to the Sites.
