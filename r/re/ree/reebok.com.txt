The protection of children’s personal data is extremely important. Reebok understands that it has a responsibility to protect the privacy of children and has no intention of collecting the data of children under the age of 13. We encourage parents and other guardians to surf the Internet together with their children and enjoy the internet in a responsible manner.
If a child under the age of 16 attempts to register himself or herself, he or she is initially asked to provide the information as described in the above section entitled “What personal data is collected”. In addition, he or she is asked for consent from the parent/guardian to the registration. The data submitted by and collected about the child during the course of his or her visit (e.g. via cookies) may be used as described above.
If a child under the age of 13 attempts to submit a registration application, this will be rejected with the notification that applications from children under the age of 13 are not accepted. For that reason, we ask parents and other guardians to check on and monitor their children’s Internet usage in order to protect them.

If you are interacting with one of the Social Plug-ins, this information will be transferred to the social network. In case you do not wish such a data transfer, please log off on your social network before you enter one of our websites or (mobile) applications.
We cannot influence this data collection and data transfer via the Social Plug-ins. Please read the privacy policies of those social networks for detailed information about the collection and transfer of personal data, what rights you have and how you can achieve satisfactory privacy settings.

This further means that when you visit our website or (mobile) application, the web analytics data described above in chapter 2 – including the “click-stream data”, the data from “web beacons and tracking links” and information stored in Coremetrics’ cookies – will be sent to Coremetrics for analysis for and on behalf of Reebok.
