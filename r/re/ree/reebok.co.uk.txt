What does Reebok do when we transfer your Personal Data outside of the EU/EEA?
Depending on the Personal Data processing activity, your Personal Data is shared with different “Categories of Recipients”. Where the recipient is located outside the EU/EEA, we have implemented necessary measures such as singing the EU Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the EU Commission or selecting vendors that certify and comply with the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework.
How do we secure your Personal Data?
We implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to address the risks corresponding to our use of your Personal Data, including loss, alteration, or unauthorised access to your Personal Data, and empowering you to exercise your rights. We require our service providers to do the same through contractual agreements. However, you should be aware that any transmission of your Personal Data through the internet is at your own risk. We can only protect your Personal Data when we have it.
What are your rights and how can you exercise them?
Under the GDPR and applicable data protection laws in the EU/EEA countries, you have the rights listed and explained below. We need to confirm your identity before we can handle your requests. When we refuse your request for legal reasons, we will tell you why.
For all enquiries concerning your privacy and personal data, please contact us under the “ASK CUSTOMER SERVICE” section via HELP .
Please consult your local supervisory authority about your rights under the GDPR and to understand what these rights mean.

Delete your Personal Data
You have the right to ask us to delete your Personal Data if: a) we no longer need it for a specific purpose, for example, a contract or a legal requirement; or b) you withdraw the consent you provided if we asked for your consent when we collected your Personal Data; or c) if you object to our use of your Personal Data based on legitimate interests we have identified, including direct marketing activities, unless we can demonstrate the compelling need of the legitimate interests.
Restrict how we use your Personal Data
You have the right to stop us from doing certain things to your Personal Data when: a) you don’t think we are using the right Personal Data; b) you don't want us to delete your Personal Data, but you also don't think we are complying with the law; c) you want to make a legal complaint against us, but we want to delete the data; or d) you challenge our explanation of our use based on a "legitimate interest".

When we use automated decision-making tools or processes that lead to an outcome which produces a legal effect (such as Payment Fraud Detection), you have the right to understand the logic involved, the significance and possible consequences of this process. You also have the right to request human intervention, especially when this is used to conclude a contract with us. You can challenge our decision by expressing your opinion.
