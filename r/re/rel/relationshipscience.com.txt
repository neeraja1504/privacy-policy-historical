Last Updated: May 24, 2018
This privacy policy explains how Relationship Science (" RelSci ," " we ", “ our ” and " us "), collects, uses, shares and protects information obtained from visitors to this www.relationshipscience.com website (the " Site ") and RelSci Pro and RelSci Lite subscribers.
This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms of Use constitute a single agreement between you and us (the “ Agreement ”).  Please read this Privacy Policy carefully.  By visiting the Site and providing information to us you consent to our collection, processing, storage, sharing and use of your information consistent with the terms of this Privacy Policy and to all terms and conditions contained in the Terms of Use ** . If you do not agree to be bound by these terms, your only choice is not to use our Site  **.
** NOTICE TO EU DATA SUBJECTS (INCLUDING VISITORS TO THE SITE FROM THE EU AND INDIVIDUALS FROM THE EU WHOSE DATA WE USE TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES)  **
** Please read this Privacy Policy and accompanying Terms of Use carefully and click  **here ** for further information about your privacy rights.  **
** Personal Information and Other Data We Collect  **
We consider all information that can be used to identify a specific individual, such as name, mailing address, email address and telephone number, to be personally identifiable information (“ PII ” or “ personal information ”).
RelSci collects several types of information about or relating to you, including:
Information that you voluntarily provide to us, including personal information, such as when you create an account on the Site, including your name and contact details, email address, and phone number
Information about your social and business connections (collectively, “ Contacts ”) that you choose affirmatively, or enable us to, upload to the Site, including the Client Data (as such term is defined in the  Terms of Use ). We collect information about your Contacts when you directly input it to the Site, and also when you synchronize non-Site content, such as your electronic address book (e.g., your contact information stored on an email server, on your computer or mobile phone) with your account on the Site
Information about you and your Contacts that we obtain from third parties, such as data aggregators, public sources, and advertising networks, which we may combine with the information received about you and your Contacts through our Site
Information about you and your visits to our Site, but which does not specifically identify you, such as the pages you view, search terms you enter, and other actions you take in connection with the Site. We may also collect certain information from the browser, server, computer or other device you used to come to our Site, such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type and language, the operating system on your computer or device, the device identifier for your mobile device, the time you accessed our Site, what country or general geographic area you are located in, the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) of the website that referred you to our Site and to which URL you browse away from our Site if you click on a link on our Site.  We will collect this information regardless of whether you subscribe to any of our Services (as defined in the  Terms of Use ) or only visit the Site for informational purposes.  This information may be collected automatically when you navigate our Site.  While this information does not in and of itself identify you, we may maintain it or associate it with personal information that we collect in other ways or receive from third parties.  Doing this helps us improve our Site and to deliver a better and more personalized service to you, including enabling us to store information about your preferences, allowing us to customize our Site according to your individual interests, speed up your searches, and recognize you when you return to our Site. Additionally, persons to whom we make such non-identifying information available as described in this Privacy Policy may be able to aggregate such data with other data available to them and thus be able to identify you.
You may provide us your information when you register to use our Site, when you subscribe to receive our Services, when you create a user account, when you use one of our online tools, when you carry out a transaction on our Site (such as making a payment), or when you report a problem with our Site.  You understand that by creating an account, uploading information to our Site, or interacting with us in any of these ways, we and other users of the Site or our Services will be able to identify you.
Cookies
When you visit the Site, whether or not you are a subscriber, we may send one or more "cookies" (small data files) to your browser to uniquely identify you, let us help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Site. A cookie may convey anonymous information about how you browse the Site to us, but does not collect personal information about you unless you are a subscriber to one of our Services, in which case your name may be included in the cookie to facilitate faster access to the Site.
We may use both persistent and session cookies.  A persistent cookie remains on your computer after you close your browser so that it can be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Site. Most persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser's directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears or becomes inactive after you close your browser.
You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.  However, keep in mind that some features of the Site may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.
Do Not Track
We will attempt to respect your wishes when you set your browser to “do not track” (a setting that your Internet browser may make available to you, which allows you to choose not to have your online behavior tracked).  However, we cannot guarantee that in all instances your information will not be tracked by our Site or by a third party performing services for us (such as Google Analytics).
Log Files
Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page. When you use the Site, our servers automatically record certain information that your web browser sends whenever you visit any website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, IP address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.
Children
Minors (those under the age of 18) may not use the Site. We do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 18, and no part of the Site is designed to attract anyone under the age of 18. Because we do not intentionally collect any information from children under the age of 18, we also do not knowingly share or disclose such information to third parties. If you have reason to believe that a child under 18 years of age has provided us with personal information, please contact us at Privacy@RelSci.com and we will take appropriate action under applicable law.
** How We Use Your Information  **
