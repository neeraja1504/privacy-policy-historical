Use of cookies
The Reliablesoft.Net Web site use “cookies” to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Reliablesoft.Net pages, or register with Reliablesoft.Net site or services, a cookie helps Reliablesoft.Net to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Reliablesoft.Net Web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Reliablesoft.Net features that you customized.
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Reliablesoft.Net services or Web sites you visit.
Google Ads and DART
Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on your site.
Google’s use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and other sites on the Internet. Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy.
Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose personally identifiable information or personally sensitive data through Reliablesoft.Net public message boards, this information may be collected and used by others. Note: Reliablesoft.Net does not read any of your private online communications.
