If you choose to link your Releaseday account with a social networking service, Releaseday and that service may share certain information about you and your activities. With your consent, we also may share information about your activities, including what you watch on Releaseday, with that social network’s users.
Connecting with Facebook While Using the Releaseday Services.
Facebook and Releaseday have developed a process that allows you to connect your Releaseday account with your Facebook account. When you connect your accounts, you authorize Releaseday and Facebook to share certain information about you with each other..
When you choose to share information about your activities on Releaseday with Facebook, Facebook may make that information visible to Facebook users in accordance with applicable law, the Facebook Data Use Policy, and your Facebook privacy settings. You can always stop or start sharing your activities on Releaseday with Facebook at any time using the Account > Privacy and Settings controls on Releaseday.
Sharing on Releaseday
When you connect your Releaseday and Facebook accounts, Releaseday will access the list of all your Facebook friends and import them to Releaseday. All of your Facebook friends who have also connected their Releaseday and Facebook accounts will be connected to you on Releaseday. Any Facebook friend who connects his or her Releaseday and Facebook accounts at a later date will also automatically be connected to you on Releaseday. This means that, if you choose to share your activities on Releaseday, all of your Facebook friends who have connected their Facebook and Releaseday accounts will be able to see what you watch when they use Releaseday. You can always stop or start sharing your activities on the Releaseday Service at any time using the Account > Privacy and Settings controls on Releaseday.
Separate Lists of Friends
Although Releaseday imports all of your friends from Facebook, the Releaseday and Facebook privacy settings are separate. This means that your Facebook privacy controls do not control who can see your activity on Releaseday. As a result, if you choose to connect your Facebook and Releaseday accounts and enable sharing, then all of your Facebook friends will be able to see your Releaseday activity when they use Releaseday.
In addition, if you visit Releaseday while logged into Facebook, then Facebook may be able to identify you and to associate the technical information provided by your web browser with other information that Facebook already has about you.
