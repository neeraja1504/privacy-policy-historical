What is RelevantID®?
RelevantID is a technology utilized by RelevantView ® that works through a combination of watermarking and digital fingerprint technology to enable RelevantView to improve the quality and integrity of survey results for its customers (“ _ _Users__ ”). Digital fingerprinting is the process of collecting data points from the web browser of a respondent’s computer to create a unique identifier.
RelevantID does not download any software onto a respondent’s computer. RelevantID does not track the online activities of a respondent.
RelevantID obtains the Collected Infor mation (as defined herein) from a respondent’s computer when the respondent joins a survey panel, starts a survey or participates in a marketing campaign.
Information Collected In Connection with RelevantID
RelevantID does not collect any personally identifiable information ( “ _ PII__ ”) concerning the owner or user of a computer (though we do collect the publicly available IP address, which may be considered _PII in some non-US jurisdictions). RelevantID collects publicly available information from within the web browser of a respondent computer. This publicly available information may include, without limitation, the operating system version, the browser version, screen resolution, and display information (the “ _ _Collected Information__ ”).    __
Uses of Collected Information
Collected Information is processed through RelevantID’s proprietary algorithm to create a digital fingerprint that is assigned to a respondent’s computer. Collected Information is used solely to confirm the unique presence of a respondent’s computer. Collected Information is used only in connection with RelevantID and is not used, transferred, sold or distributed for any other purpose(s).
Generally, RelevantID is used for de-duping purposes, to perform respondent quality assessments, and redirect detection and prevention services. In the event that a User provides RelevantView with a respondent ID, RelevantView can match the respondent ID to the RelevantID. After matching the respondent ID and RelevantID, RelevantView will provide the matched IDs to the User , either in a database or some other form or format as requested by the User. At no time does RelevantView receive or have access to any PII connected to the respondent IDs.
Disclosure of Collected Information
The RelevantID and the Collected Information are disclosed only to the User and its authorized employees and/or agents.
Disclaimer
RelevantView hereby disclaims any and all liability and/or responsibility for the privacy practices of Users. RelevantView strongly recommends that respondents refer to the User and/or the User’s website(s) for information on the privacy practices applicable to the appropriate User. RelevantView does not review, comment upon, or monitor its Users’ compliance with their respective privacy policies.
Disclosures
RelevantView will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that RelevantID is safe, secure and does not cause undue privacy or data security risks.
In the event that RelevantView discovers or learns of any unethical conduct in connection with the use of RelevantID or that RelevantID is being used in a manner inconsistent with this RelevantID Privacy Policy; and/or (i) any applicable international, Federal, state and/or local laws, codes, regulations, rules and/or requirements and/or (ii) codes and regulations of the trade and/or professional association(s) and/or organization(s) with whom RelevantView is a member, including without limitation the Council of American Survey Research Organizations, RelevantView will use its best efforts to correct, rectify, and prohibit such unethical conduct and to ensure the proper administration of RelevantID.
