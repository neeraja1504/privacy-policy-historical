This blog accepts forms of cash advertising, sponsorship, or other forms of compensation, such as free products to review and giveaway. (Mama likes to pay the bills and the fam likes free stuff)
This blog abides by word of mouth marketing standards. We believe in honesty of relationship, opinion and identity.  (Not here to trick anyone) The compensation received may influence the advertising content, topics or posts made in this blog.

Even though the owner(s) of this blog receives compensation for our posts or advertisements, we always give our honest opinions, findings, beliefs, or experiences on those topics or products (I’ve said it a million times, I don’t post what I don’t believe in. I have had to turn down products in the past and don’t hesitate to do so, yo). The views and opinions expressed on this blog are purely the bloggers’ own (I am my own woman, ya hear shakes fist in air sarcastically). Any product claim, statistic, quote or other representation about a product or service should be verified with the manufacturer, provider or party in question.(I am not an expert or a salesman… have your people call their people… remember, I don’t gots people ;))
