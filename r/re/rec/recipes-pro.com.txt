NO REGISTRATION OR PERSONAL INFORMATION IS REQUIRED for general use of the Toolbar. If any features or associated websites or services of the Toolbar require registration or the provision of personal information, such requirement will be made known to you when you first use such feature, associated website or specific service. The collection and usage policies applicable to collected information may vary between different Toolbar features, associated websites or services, but in each case, the relevant policies will be made available either via a link within the Toolbar itself, or via a link within the feature or associated website.
Un-installation/Removal of the Toolbar
The Toolbar can be easily uninstalled. If you want to uninstall this product, there are several ways to do so:
a. From your computer's "Start" button, select "Settings", then "Control Panel"; (ii) Double-click on "Add/Remove Programs" for Windows XP or "Programs and Features" for Windows Vista; (iii) Select "My Web Search" (Product name) or "(Toolbar name); (iv) Click "Remove"; (v) You must reboot your computer to completely remove the toolbar.
b. You can also click on the settings button on the right hand corner of the Toolbar, then select "Uninstall (Product name)" under "Toolbar Options".
Privacy
The Toolbar does not collect any personal information about you (such as your name, email address, etc.). Further, it does not: (a) collect or report back to us (or anyone else) any information about your activities on sites you visit on the Internet; (b) collect any search queries or information that you provide to any other web-sites; (c) serve pop-ups when you are on other websites; or (d) collect or report back to us (or anyone else) any data regarding your computer keystrokes or other data unrelated to the services the Toolbar provides.
Search Queries.
The Toolbar, in the course of processing a given search query, sends a request to our servers. This request includes the keyword query, time of day, browser type, default language setting, IP address, an anonymous unique ID, and a code which identifies the marketing or distribution source of the toolbar used by you to conduct your search. If the search query is being generated as the result of a misspelled URL or search term entered in to the browser address bar, we also receive the misspelled URL address or search term. We use this information in order to properly process your search request. For example, this data provides us with: information on which language you prefer to use; aggregated click information for the purpose of ensuring that our search partners are appropriately compensating us; information that allows us to make accurate payments to our distributors; aggregated usage and retention information; and aggregated search query information for the purpose of further monetizing commercially oriented search keywords. All information collected from a search query is recorded on a non-personally identifiable basis and is kept strictly anonymous. The information collected is stored in a query log for up to six months. In addition, all information about search activity is evaluated only on an aggregated basis (except in response to a customer service inquiry or legal process).
Cookies.
The Toolbar also uses "cookies". We do this for two reasons. First, we use the cookies to store a code designating a marketing or distribution source for the Toolbar. This information allows us to properly distinguish between Toolbar versions for purposes of analyzing retention and usage per marketing or distribution source, on an aggregated basis. Second, the Toolbar uses cookies to store user preferences. For example, we use a cookie to record which search engine you have selected as your default provider. Upon accessing the search results pages, cookies may also be placed on your computer, to store your use preferences. We do not use cookies to track your use of the Internet in any other way or to store any personally-identifiable information, and we do not disclose cookie information to third parties (other than as required by legal process). Certain third party partners/service providers may also use cookies in relation to services they provide on or via the Toolbar. For example, when you click on a third party offer presented via an Toolbar product, such third party may place an affiliate cookie on your computer to facilitate your interaction with the third party. Please note - third party sites, offers and/or cookies are not controlled by us. Such content is subject to policies of its respective third party owner (found on the third party's website). We strongly suggest that you familiarize yourself with the policies of any third party vendor you choose to engage.
Configuration Requests/Communications with our Servers.
The Toolbar sends a configuration request when you start your browser. This request is approximately 5k in size and includes only anonymous data such as IP address, browser type, and information about the specific release date and distribution source of your Toolbar, as outlined above. In addition, periodically when using the Toolbar, small communications may be sent to our servers indicating certain user preferences, as outlined above. All such information is anonymous, non-personally identifiable, and is used only for purposes of delivering search and Toolbar services and content in accordance with your preferences.
If the Toolbar is ever sold or all or substantially all of the assets relating to the Toolbar and/or associated websites are transferred to another entity, we may transfer all information provided by or collected from you, including personally identifiable information, in order to ensure continuity of your service. We will disclose information, including personally identifiable information, data acquired by cookies, and other data, where required by a subpoena, interception order or other lawful process. We also reserve the right to disclose such information when we believe, in our sole judgment and to the extent consistent with applicable law, that such disclosure is necessary to protect the rights or safety of others or to enforce, or protect our rights under, this agreement. If you wish to withdraw your consent to the communication and data usage as described herein, you should uninstall the Toolbar from your computer.
