R29's Privacy Policy - Your Information Is Protected on Refinery29
Last updated: May 13, 2015
Refinery 29 Inc. (“Refinery29” or “we”) takes your privacy extremely seriously. This privacy policy describes how we treat and use the information we collect when you visit or use our web site Refinery29.com, mobile-optimized versions of the web site, or software applications to which this policy is linked (collectively, “Website”), including when you sign-up for our newsletters.
Your use of our Website will indicate your understanding and agreement to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosures and other uses of your information as described in this privacy policy.
Collection of Information
Children. We do not offer the Website to anyone under the age 18 and do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. No one under age 13 may provide any information to or on the Website. If you are under 13, do not use or provide any personal information on or through the Website, register on the Website, or use any of the interactive or public comment features of this Website or provide any information about yourself to us, including your name, email address or any screen name or user name you may use.
Information You Provide. We generally collect personally identifiable information that you voluntarily provide. For instance, information may be collected when you: sign up for our newsletters, create an account/register on our Website, complete a survey, post a comment to an article on our Website, enter a sweepstakes or contest, or participate in our social networking features. Further, you may be asked to provide your email address, your name, buying preferences, annual income, or other demographic or profile information, Twitter or Facebook usernames or other usernames and aliases used for purposes of linking to and/or posting on your social media accounts, and other information you choose to submit. We will collect such information as well as any other content that you provide to us in engaging in any of the above activities or any other activities on the Website. Additionally, if you elect to post material to any blogs, forums, or participate in our community boards that may be offered on our Website, then such materials will be collected and may be publicly available for others to view. Even after you terminate your account, all such materials submitted by you on the Website or our social media channels may be retained by us indefinitely and we may continue to disclose such materials publicly.
Other Information We Collect. We and other parties may also collect information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or other online services (behavioral tracking), such as pages visited and how often and for how long they are visited. We may use various technologies and features to collect this information, such as tracking your activities through your Internet Protocol (IP) address, computer settings or most-recently visited URL, as well as through the use of “cookies” and “web beacons” described below.
Do-Not-Track Signals. Because there is not yet a consensus on how companies should respond to web browser-based or other “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) mechanisms, we currently do not respond to web browser DNT signals that provide a method to opt out of the collection of information about online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services. We may revisit our policy on responding to these signals, in which case we will post a revised privacy policy on this site. See “Modifications” below.
Cookies. We may place and access cookies and similar technologies on your computer, tablet or mobile device. A cookie is a small amount of data (often including a unique identifier), that is sent to your browser from a web site's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies may help you navigate the Website. We may use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and to prevent you from having to reenter your username and password each time you access the Website. We may also use cookies to control the display of ads, to track usage patterns on the sites, to deliver editorial content, to record requests for subscriptions, to personalize information and to collect aggregate Website usage information, as described below. You can delete these cookies by changing your privacy preferences in your Internet browser. You also have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use other interactive features of the Website that depend on cookies. Some of our third party partners (including advertisers and marketing services companies) may set and access cookies and similar technologies on your computer as well, or we may do so on their behalf. We do not have control over how these third parties use such cookies and similar technologies or the information derived therefrom.
Web Beacons. We may also use “web beacons” (also known as “clear GIFs” or “pixel tags”) or similar technologies, on the Website and in our communications with you to enable us to know whether you have visited a web page or received a message. A web beacon is typically a one-pixel, transparent image (although it can be a visible image as well), located on a web page or in an e-mail or other type of message, which is retrieved from a remote site on the Internet enabling the verification of an individual's viewing or receipt of a web page or message. A web beacon may enable us to relate your viewing or receipt of a web page or message to other information about you, including your personally identifiable information.
Location Information. We may, and may enable our advertisers to, collect your location via certain services we provide through digital applications, wireless access protocol services ("WAP Services") or mobile phone services. We, or the service provider, will inform you of such collection at the time you use the service. By using such service, you hereby consent to our collection, use and disclosure of your location information as described.
General Usage Information. In addition, we may gather aggregate usage information about Website users on an anonymous basis. This information is not personally identifiable and will be used to determine how our Website is being used. Examples of such information include: How much time do users spend on our site? What pages do they view? What sites did they come from? What sites do they go to? All of this information is collected to help us create a better, faster, more efficient website and to provide you with better content. We may also share aggregate usage information, in aggregate anonymous form, with our prospective and actual business partners, advertisers and other third parties for any business purpose.

otherwise with your consent or in accordance with your indicated preferences (e.g., you indicated you wanted to receive promotional materials directly from a third party partner); or
in connection with a sale, merger, transfer, exchange, or other disposition (whether of assets, stock, or otherwise) of all or a portion of the business conducted by the Website to which this policy applies, in which case the acquiring company will possess the information collected by us and will assume the rights and obligations regarding your personally identifiable information as described in this privacy policy.
