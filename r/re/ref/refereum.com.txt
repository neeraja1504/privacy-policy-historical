Privacy Policy
Privacy Policy
Effective Date: May 1, 2018
Refereum respects your privacy. We endeavor to build a community that you can trust and strive to be
transparent about the data we collect about you, how we use that data, with whom we share your data,
and your rights to manage and control your data. This Privacy Policy (including our ​Cookie Policy
(​https://refereum.com/legal/cookiepolicy​) applies when you use the products and services we make
available to you on ​www.refereum.com​, or any other websites or software applications operated by
Refereum, and any communications between you and Refereum on any media or format (the
“​Refereum Service​”).
By using the Refereum Service you agree and consent to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
Your choices on how we use, collect, and share data are described in this Privacy Policy.
Refereum collaborates and has business relationships with other companies, for example, providers of
channels, content, and services (including analytics and ad-related services), who may also collect data
from the Refereum Service, and share data with us. We also have accounts on third party publishing
platforms and social networking sites that let you engage with and follow Refereum and other users.
This Privacy Policy does not cover the actions of these or any other third parties, and we cannot control
how such third parties may collect, use, or secure your data. For information about a third party’s
privacy practices, please consult the privacy policy of that third party.
DATA WE COLLECT
We collect your personal data in different ways: data you provide to us; data we collect about you from
third parties; and data we automatically collect when you use the Refereum Service. If we combine or
associate data from other sources with data that we collect through the Refereum Service, we will treat
the combined data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Data You Provide
You provide us personal data when you register for a Refereum account (“​Account​”), engage with the
Refereum Service, create content using the Refereum Service, or when you communicate with us. You
are not required to provide us any personal data; though if you don’t, it may limit your ability to use the
Refereum Service.
- Account Data​.​ You can register for an Account by providing us your email, and if applicable,
creating a password. If you do not register for an Account, you may only access limited content
on the Refereum Service, such as obtaining basic information about the Refereum Service,
viewing a list of the games and streamers that are available on the Refereum Service, or
watching video trailers. An Account allows you to access other features of the Refereum Service,
including buying digital content, watching videos, watching others play video games, allowing
Refereum Account holders to watch your streams, engaging with third party services by linking
your Refereum Account to such services, engaging with any other products or services that we
may offer from time to time, and entering sweepstakes, and contests and other promotions
offered by Refereum (each, a “​Promotion​”).
1
-   Payment Data​. ​To facilitate the processing of purchase transactions, we may ask you to provide
your financial data as may be required by our payment processors. If you participate in our
Promotions, we may ask you to provide your financial data for us to send cash prizes (e.g.
PayPal) and related prizes in cryptocurrencies (e.g. your Ethereum wallet address).
-   Identity Verification Data​. ​To help create and maintain a trusted environment and as may be
required by applicable laws, we may collect identity verification data (such as images of your
government issued ID, passport, national ID card, or driving license, as permitted by applicable
laws) or other authentication data.
-   Communications Data​. ​You may communicate with us by filling out surveys, providing feedback
or leaving comments, chatting with us, emailing us, or contacting us through the Refereum
Service or via any other means. When you communicate with us, we collect all data that you
volunteer. Such communication is voluntary and is not required to use the Refereum Service,
but we may use the data you provide to develop or improve the Refereum Service, respond to
your inquiry, provide you customer service, help you troubleshoot, or otherwise help provide or
support the Refereum Service.
-   Other Data​. If you are a potential winner in a Promotion, we may ask you for your name,
address, phone number, proof of your age, proof of identity (which may include submitting a
copy of a driver’s license, passport or similar government issued identification), tax identification
number, and financial account data (if you win a cash prize or related prizes in cryptocurrencies).
You are not required to provide the requested data; though, if you don’t, you will not be
declared a winner of the Promotion and will not be eligible to receive any prizes.
Data Collected From Third Parties
We collect data about you from third-party service providers.
- Account Data​. ​You can register for an Account through a third party service provider for which
you have approved our access (e.g., Twitch, Discord or Facebook) (each, an “​Authorized Third
Party Service​”) from which we may collect your username, email address, and profile picture
which we will display in your Account profile. In addition, we also receive third party
authentication key and your user id to allow us to receive your data with the Authorized Third
Party Service. Your username and profile picture may also be seen by other users of the
Refereum Service (e.g., when you watch a stream or your position on the leaderboard). When
you connect to the Refereum Service through any Authorized Third-Party Service, you are
authorizing us to collect, store, and use such data according to this Privacy Policy.
- Streaming Data​.​ If you connect to an Authorized Third-Party Service to stream digital content,
we may collect your username and viewing data, which includes data about you and other
viewers who are watching your stream, and capture and collect thumbnail images of you
streaming. We may also obtain data from the Authorized Third-Party Services about the content
you choose to stream such as the title of the content and whether you own that content.
- Other Data​. We collect usernames from certain Authorized Third-Party Services when you
engage with us on such third party services, to verify that you are a Refereum Account holder.
In addition, we may receive data about you from third party service providers who provide
identity verification services, geolocation data, and your IP address.
These third party services have their own privacy policies which apply to their collection, use and sharing
of personal data. We encourage you to read their privacy policies carefully before you decide to create
or otherwise connect your Account through any Authorized Third-Party Service. Refereum does not have
any control over the protection and privacy of the data you provide to the any third-party service and is
not responsible for how any such service collect and use the data you provide to them.

When you use the Refereum Service or open one our emails, we use cookies and similar technologies
(collectively, “​Cookies​”) to automatically record and store certain data. ​Cookies ​enable our systems to

use them, and how to control the use of Cookies, including information on how to opt-out of Cookies,
please read our ​Cookie Policy​ available at ​https://refereum.com/legal/cookiepolicy​.
When you visit or use the Refereum Service, we log usage data, such as when you view or click on
content. We also collect your IP address, a unique user ID, device ID, referring and exit page addresses,
software and system type, and how you use the Refereum Service. Examples of how we use the data we
automatically collect from you include the following:

while using the Refereum Service or the next time you access the Service;
- Provide you with a customized experience by showing advertisements, content, and information
you may find most interesting or relevant;
- Monitor the effectiveness of marketing campaigns; and
- Monitor and store aggregate data on site usage metrics such as total number of visitors, pages
visited, videos and video games streamed, number of hours streamed, and number of viewers of
videos and streams.
HOW WE USE YOUR DATA
We are committed to providing you a customized and engaging experience. Our use of your personal
data will depend on how you use the Refereum Service and the choices you make in allowing us to use
your personal data.
Services
Your personal data allows us to provide, support, personalize, and develop the Refereum Service,

- contact you in connection with a Promotion, such as if you are selected as a winner;

information relating to the availability of the Refereum Service, or any aspect thereof.
Advertising
We use third-party analytics services (“​Third Party Analytics​”), such as Google Analytics and Facebook
Analytics to provide site metrics and other analytics services. These Third-Party Services use cookies,
web beacons, and other technologies to collect data, such as your IP address, your device ID, other
applications on your device, the browsers you use to access our Services, web pages viewed, time spent
on webpages, links clicked, and conversion data (e.g., transactions entered into). The data collected by
these Third Party Analytics is described in the section titled, “​Data Collected by Automated Means​.”
Some of the Promotions and streams that you see on the Refereum Service is sponsored content,
meaning that a third-party advertiser is paying to have the content featured on the Refereum Service.
This content may look similar to non-sponsored content, except that they are labeled “ads” or
“sponsored.” If you engage with such content (e.g., by watching a stream or entering into a Promotion),
your username and/or profile picture may be viewable by all users of the Refereum Service, and your
data may be collected along with other users of the Refereum Service to provide aggregated data to the
advertiser.
Aggregate Data
We use aggregate data from you and users of the Refereum Service to generate aggregate insights. This
data does not identify you, but helps us to understand how the Refereum Service is being used,
including the types of games streamed, the number of hours streamed, and the number of viewers per
game.
Security and Investigations
We use data for security, fraud prevention and investigations. Your data and communications may be
used if we think it is necessary for security purposes or to investigate possible fraud or other violations
of our​ ​Terms of Service​ (​https://refereum.com/Legal/Terms​), this Privacy Policy and/or any other
Refereum terms or rules.

We share your data with the following third parties for the following purposes:
- To service providers working on our behalf, including to provide website hosting, maintenance,

contemplation of such transaction (e.g. due diligence). This means that the person or entity buying our
business or a part of our business will continue to have the right to use your data in the ways described
in this Privacy Policy, unless you agree otherwise. For those persons or entities who do not become an
Affiliate, such parties will not have the legal right to continued access to, or use of, your data.

Lawful Bases for Processing
We only collect, use and share your personal data where we have lawful bases. Lawful bases include the
following:
- Consent​. ​You provide us explicit consent before we process any data based on consent;
- Contract​. You agree to the processing of personal data that is necessary for entering into an

Do Not Track
Do Not Track (“​DNT​”) is the proposed functionality that requests that a website disable its tracking of an
individual user. ​Regulatory agencies have encouraged the Internet industry to develop and implement a
mechanism for allowing Internet users to control the tracking of their online activities across websites by
using browser settings. To date, no industry standard has been adopted for DNT, therefore, Refereum
does not respond to "do not track" signals.
Security
We take appropriate physical, technical and administrative safeguards to protect the security and
confidentiality of the personal data you entrust to us against loss, misuse, unauthorized access,
disclosure, alteration, or destruction. We use technical safeguards such as firewalls, two-factor
authentication, and data encryption. We enforce physical access controls to our office and files, and we
authorize access to personal data only for those employees who require it to fulfill their job
responsibilities. However, no system of security is ever completely secure or error free. As such, we
cannot guarantee the security of any data you transmit to Refereum and you do so at your own risk.

transferring of your data in and to the United States and other countries. Please note that the laws of

Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the
