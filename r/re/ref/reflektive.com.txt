Privacy Policy | Reflektive
We are Reflektive, Inc. (" ** Reflektive** "). This Privacy Policy describes how we protect your data and respect your privacy. Any questions or concerns with respect to your data or privacy should be directed to privacy@reflektive.com.
1 Applicability of this Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy applies to Reflektive's website located at https://www.reflektive.com and other Reflektive websites and domains (collectively, the " ** Websites "), Reflektive's online performance management tools and platform, including web and mobile applications (collectively, the " ** Services "), and any other interactions (e.g., customer support inquiries, etc.) you may have with Reflektive.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third party applications or technology that integrate with the Services, or any other third party products, services, or businesses (" ** Third Party Services "). While using the Services, you may be directed to a third party website via links or other references, which may take you to that third party website (" ** Third Party Websites "). This Privacy Policy does not apply to you or any other data collected from or provided by you to Third Party Websites. You should review such Third Party Services' or Third Party Websites' privacy policy (and such other terms and conditions) to determine how your data will be used before sharing any Personal Data.
2 Notice to End Users
By visiting the Websites, accessing or using the Services, or interacting with any aspect of our business, you accept the terms of this Privacy Policy and expressly consent to our collection, use, and disclosure of data, including Personal Data, provided to or otherwise received by us for the purposes and in the manner described in this Privacy Policy and the applicable Client Agreement.
A separate agreement governs the delivery, access, and use of the Services (the " ** Client Agreement "), including the processing of any " ** Client Data ," which is defined in the applicable Client Agreement but generally includes all data, files, messages, content, or information that Client and/or Authorized Users transmit, upload, transfer, process, store, or submit on or through the Services. The organization (e.g., your employer or another entity or person) that entered into the Client Agreement (" ** Client ") controls their instance of the Services (their " ** Workspace ") and any associated Client Data. Client, and individuals who have been authorized by Client, who access or use the Services via their Workspace (e.g., Client's employees, managers, and human resources administrators) are " ** Authorized Users** ". Your use of the Services may be subject to your Client's (e.g. your employer's) policies, if any. If you have any questions about your specific Workspace settings and privacy practices, please contact the Client whose Workspace you use. Reflektive is not responsible for the privacy or security practices of our Clients, which may differ from those set forth in this Privacy Policy.
3 Data We Collect and Receive
Sometimes you provide us with data and sometimes data about you is collected automatically. To the extent data is associated with an identified or identifiable natural person and is protected as personal data under applicable data protection laws, it is referred to in this Privacy Policy as " ** Personal Data**." You acknowledge and agree we may collect, process, store, access, and disclose Personal Data disclosed by you or your Client (e.g., your employer) to facilitate the provision of Services and related support for the Services in the manner described in this Privacy Policy and the applicable Client Agreement.
3.1 Client Data
Clients and Authorized Users routinely submit Client Data to Reflektive when using the Services. Client Data is governed by the Client Agreement. Client Data may include Account Information, Hosted Data, Sync Data, or any Client Data otherwise defined in the Client Agreement. If you have any questions about your Personal Data with respect to Client Data, please contact the Client whose Workspace you use.
Account Information.
To create or update an Authorized User account for the Services, you or your Client (e.g. your employer) provide us with data about you and your employment, such as:
* your name
* date of birth
* job title
* work email address
* office location
* office phone number
* your company department or organization
* your manager's name
* unique identifier
* employment dates
* profile picture
* user name
* password
* any other applicable Personal Data that may identify you individually
* #### Hosted Data.
When a Client uses, or Authorized User interacts with, the Services, we may collect, process, and store any data that is created, posted, uploaded, stored, displayed, transmitted, or submitted on or through the Services (collectively, " ** Hosted Data** "), as a function of rendering the Services. Hosted Data may contain Personal Data to the extent a Client or Authorized User discloses Personal Data on or through the Services. Reflektive is a passive recipient and takes no active part in collecting or storing Hosted Data. Except to the extent necessary to render the Services or related support for the Services, Reflektive does not purposefully access any Hosted Data. For example, if you submit a review of another Authorized User, the Services passively processes and stores such performance review for the purpose of rendering the Services, and we will only access such information to the extent necessary to provide the Services and related support for the Services.
* #### Sync Data.
Reflektive makes tools available to integrate data from Third Party Services used by Client into the Services (" ** Sync Data** "). For example, Client may integrate its Workspace with Client's human capital management platform. When the Services are integrated with a Third Party Service for Sync Data, we will receive all data selected by the Client to sync with the Services. Sync Data is imported into the Services as either Account Information, Hosted Data, or such other Client Data.
3.2 Other Information
Reflektive may collect Other Information from Clients and Authorized Users related to their usage of the Services and interactions with Reflektive. Other Information may include Metadata, Log Data, Technical Data, Cookie Data, Third Party Services, and Additional Information Provided to Reflektive. If you have any questions about your Personal Data with respect to Other Information, please contact Reflektive at privacy@reflektive.com.
Metadata.
When an Authorized User interacts with the Services, metadata is generated that provides additional context about the Services and the way Authorized Users use the Services (" ** Metadata** "). Reflektive collects aggregated Metadata of the Services, so that the resulting data and statistics are not personally identifiable to any individual Authorized User.
* #### Log Data.
Like most websites and web-based technology services, our servers automatically collect data when you access or use our Websites or the Services and record it in log files (" ** Log Data** "). The Log Data may include your Internet Protocol (IP) address, Internet service provider (ISP), browser type and settings, information about browser plugins, language preference, default email application, referring/exit websites, operating system, date and time stamp, cookie data, and certain user activities.
* #### Technical Data.
Reflektive collects technical data, such as information about devices accessing the Services, including the type of device, device settings, operating system, application software, peripherals, and unique device identifiers (" ** Technical Data** "). Reflektive does not collect Personal Data with any Technical Data or relate any Technical Data to any individual Authorized User.
* #### Cookie Information.
Reflektive uses cookies and similar technologies in our Websites and Services that help us collect Other Information. The Websites and Services may also include cookies and similar tracking technologies of third parties, which may collect Other Information about you via the Websites and Services. Cookies are small text files sent by us to your computer or mobile device for later retrieval. They are unique to your Authorized User account or your browser. Session-based cookies last only while your browser is open and are automatically deleted when you close your browser. Persistent cookies last until you or your browser delete them or until they expire. We use both session-based and persistent cookies to help with authentication, security, identifying your preferences, analytics, and otherwise monitoring the functionality and performance of the Services. If you do not wish to have cookies placed on your computer or in local storage, you may adjust your web browser settings accordingly. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can set your browser to block cookies or to alert you when cookies are sent. However, restricting cookies may impede your ability to use the Services or certain features of the Services.
* #### Third Party Services.
Clients may choose to permit or restrict integrations with Third Party Services for their Workspace. Once enabled, the enabled Third Party Services may share certain data with Reflektive to effectuate the integration. You should check the privacy settings and notices of these Third Party Services to understand what data may be disclosed to Reflektive. When the Services are integrated with Third Party Services to enhance the Services (e.g., Slack, Jira, Gmail, etc.), we may receive data regarding your credentials for and use of the applicable Third Party Services, such as your user name, your unique identifier, and your information transmitted from or made available with permissions by such Third Party Services ( e.g., account profile, gender, age range, language, geographic region, etc.). When the Services are integrated with Third Party Services for the login and authentication process (e.g., Google Sign-In, OneLogin, ADFS, and many other SAML 2.0 compatible services) and an Authorized User logs in to the Services using a Third Party Services authenticator, we may receive data regarding your credentials for the applicable Third Party Services, such as your log-in, your user name, your email, your unique identifier, profile picture, and your information transmitted from or made available with permissions by such Third Party Services (e.g. account profile, gender, age range, language, geographic region, etc.).
* #### Additional Information Provided to Reflektive.
Reflektive receives data when submitted to our Websites or through our Services, or if you contact us (e.g., by email, telephone calls, written correspondence, web based forms, or otherwise), request support, apply for or take a job with us, contract with us, interact with our social media accounts, or otherwise communicate with Reflektive.
3.3 No Sensitive Personal Data
Reflektive does not intentionally collect, process, or store, and we request that you do not post, upload, store, display, transmit, or submit Sensitive Personal Data on or through the Services or in Client Data.

The Services are not directed to or intended for children, and Reflektive does not intentionally collect, process, or store any Personal Data from any person under 13 years of age. In the event we discover we have inadvertently collected, processed, or stored any Personal Data from a person under 13 years of age, we will promptly take the appropriate steps to delete such data or seek the necessary verifiable parental consent for that collection in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (" ** COPPA** ").
4 How and Why We Use Data

9.1 EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks
To comply with European Union and Swiss data protection laws, Reflektive self-certified under the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks (" ** Privacy Shield** ") as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Data transferred from the European Union member countries and Switzerland to the United States. Reflektive adheres to the Privacy Shield principles of: notice; choice; accountability for onward transfer; security; data integrity and purpose limitation; access; and recourse, enforcement, and liability. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield principles, the Privacy Shield principles shall govern with respect to Personal Data transferred from the European Union member countries and Switzerland to the United States. Reflektive is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC). To view our certification, see Reflektive's Privacy Shield Notice.
