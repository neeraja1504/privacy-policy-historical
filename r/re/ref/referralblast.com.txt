Referral Blast Privacy Policy
We know that you care how information about you and your website visitors is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly.
This notice describes our privacy policy:
Is personal information about my website visitors or the people they refer publicly used by Referral Blast in any way?
No. When a visitor clicks on your Referral Blast button or text link, a smaller window opens allowing the visitor to enter their name (optional), up to 10 email addresses of people they want to tell about the site and a custom message (optional). Referral Blast never records or 'harvests' this information for spam or public purposes, nor sells it to third-parties. We do not spam and do not associate ourselves with organizations that support such activity. Referral Blast derives its revenue solely from the sale of its product and service offerings. We understand that our success is dependent upon the success of our clients, and that the trust of our clients and their visitors is one of our most important assets to be protected at all times. This collected third party personal information is used exclusively for the purpose of providing the service of sending this one time email and is stored exclusively for the purpose of measuring the effectiveness of our services.

The security of your personal information is important to us.

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
