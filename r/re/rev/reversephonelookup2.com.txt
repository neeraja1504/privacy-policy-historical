Information - What We Collect and How We Use It
What we collect
When you submit information for publication on our Website, all information supplied will be available to the public. Please exercise caution when supplying personally identifying information. Avoid posting your email address and phone number within the post message.
In the course of using reversephonelookup2.com, some of what we will ask you for is considered "Personal Information". This term refers to personally identifiable information about you that can be used to contact or identify you. Such Personal Information typically includes but is not limited to your name, phone number, email address, credit card or other billing information, and home and business postal addresses.
We may also ask for other information, such as your zip code and personal preferences, which is typically considered "Non-Identifying Information" since it can't be used to identify you on its own. Sometimes Non-Identifying Information can be considered part of your Personal Information if it is combined in such a way that it enables you to be identified (for example, combining your zip code with your street address).
Like most other Internet sites, we use cookies to personalize and enhance your experience on our sites. No personal information is gathered via the cookies.
If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to deny or accept the cookie feature; however, you should note that cookies are necessary to provide you with certain website features.

Third party advertising
We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our Web sites. These companies may use cookies, pixel tags, or otherwise independently collect non-personally identifiable information from you and use this information about your visits to this and other sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. We do not control their collection and use of information. To learn more about this behavioral advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit networkadvertising.org.
