Opt-Outs AND WITHDRAWAL OF CONSENT
If you are located in the EU and we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. To withdraw your consent, or to learn more about your rights as a data subject, please see send an email to support@revoffers.com with your request. Regardless of whether you are located in the EU or elsewhere, you may exercise the applicable opt-out options below.
Web Browser/Cookie-Based Opt-Out
You may stop or restrict the placement of cookies on your computer or remove them from your browser by adjusting your web browser preferences. There are also many programs that allow you to manually delete your cookies.
The online advertising industry also provides websites from which you may opt-out of receiving targeted ads/interest-based advertising from us, our data partners and our other advertising partners that participate in self-regulatory programs. You may use the NAI opt-out tool at http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/, which will allow you to opt out of seeing targeted ads from us and other members. The DAA’s opt-out tool can be found at http://www.aboutads.info/choices/.

To be clear, the opt-out from targeted ads must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted out. For example, if you have opted out on your computer browser, that opt-out will not be effective on your mobile device. You must separately opt out on each device. However, once you have opted out on one device (“Opted-Out Device”), we will not use any new data from the Opted-Out Device to identify you on another device for interest-based advertising purposes, and will not use data from another device for interest-based advertising purposes on the Opted-Out Device.
If you erase or otherwise alter your cookie/device settings (including upgrading certain browsers or devices) you may need to perform each opt-out process again, unless we can match the device as outlined above.
Even if you opt out of targeted ads based on cookies, you may still see ads based on other general factors such as webpage context or browser type.
Mobile Application-Based Opt-Outs
Cookie-based opt-outs are not effective on mobile applications. Users may opt out of certain advertisements on mobile applications or reset advertising identifiers via their device settings.

You also have the right to object to the processing of your information or export your information to another service.
When you first visit a website or application, we read cookies and similar technologies on the internet browser of your device or in connection with applications you use that allows us to identify browsers and devices that have previously interacted with our Services or Business Customers. This initial reading of cookies and similar technologies allows us to determine whether you or the user(s) of your device, have previously given consent to the use of “personal data” as defined under applicable EU law.
Apart from this initial browser or device reading, if you are located in the EU then the references in this privacy policy to the collection and use of your personal data will occur only after we determine the appropriate legal basis to process such information: (i) consent, (ii) legitimate interest (as described below), or (iii) our compliance with a legal obligation. References to the opt-out possibilities set forth above will apply to you if you have first given consent to the use of your personal data as outlined below. Then you may choose to limit how we may use your personal data. EU users also have specific rights which are enumerated below.
Legal Basis For Using EU User Personal Data :
In the EU, the processing of your personal data must rely on a legal basis. For these regions, there are different legal bases that we rely on to use your personal data, namely:
Legitimate interest: We may process your personal data for consumers, Business Customers, and our legitimate interests. For example, to provide or improve our Services, perform affiliate matching (e.g., for determining referral fees or commissions owed to Business Customers), manage relationships with Business Customers, or for security purposes and fraud prevention. When we process personal information to meet our legitimate interests, we put in place safeguards to ensure that your privacy is protected and to ensure that our legitimate interests are not overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms
Consent: Our Business Customer and us will rely on your consent to use your personal data (including, without limitation, technical data, cookie data, usage information, and geo-location data), for personalized or interest-based advertising purposes. This allows our Business Customer and us to find other consumers with similar online behaviors to create lookalike modeling or to share your personal data with third parties for their marketing purposes. You may opt-out of your data usage at any time by using this Subject Access Request page or by using the tools outlined above.
In addition to the other rights outlined above, individuals based in the EU also have the right to be informed of the following:
Data Sharing: The direct recipients of your personal data include our corporate affiliates, as well as Business Customers such as advertisers and publishers in the RevOffers Ad Network. There may also be indirect recipients of a limited amount of personal data based on your internet activity because of how advertising technology and digital marketing function. Among the types of entities who may access data are: agencies, agency trading desks, retargeting entities, ad servers, privacy verification entities, measurement and analytics entities, data suppliers, data aggregators, demand-side platforms and supply side platforms, ad networks, and others on ours or our Business Customers’ behalf.
Duration of the Processing: RevOffers may actively process your personal data for one year from the time of your last interaction with our Services or the websites or applications of our Business Customers (“Interaction Date”). We may, however, store your data in a pseudonymized or anonymized form for up to seven (7) years after the Interaction Date in order to comply with other legal requirements. After such time we delete your personal data from our system(s).
Transfers of Personal Data: RevOffers and our Business Customers may be located in various countries throughout the world. As a result, personal data may also be transferred from the EU to the United States and other jurisdictions whose laws may differ from those in the EU. For data transfers to entities outside of RevOffers in countries that have not been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection by the European Commission, we may use specific contracts promulgated by the European Commission, such as the Standard Contractual Clauses.
EU Data Subject Rights
Under certain circumstances, EU users have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data, including as follows.
Access, Correction, Restriction, Erasure and Portability: You have the right to (i) access your personal data which we may have in our system(s); (ii) request correction of your personal data we have in or system(s); (iii) object to or request that we restrict the processing of your personal data under certain circumstances; (iv) request erasure of your personal data from our system(s) under certain circumstances; and (v) request transfer of your personal data out of our system(s) in a commonly used format. To exercise the access, correction, restriction, erasure and portability rights, please send an email request to support@revoffers.com
Withdrawal of Consent: Where we are relying on consent to process your personal data, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. In order to withdraw your consent, please submit a request to admin@revoffes.com
Right to Lodge a Complaint: EU users also have the right to lodge a complaint about RevOffers processing your personal data with your local data supervisory authority. We would, however, appreciate an opportunity to address your complaint before you approach the supervisory authority so please contact us in the first instance with any complaints you may have by sending an email to support@revoffers.com.
RevOffers will use all reasonable efforts to facilitate your exercise of the above rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws. Please note that in order for you to assert these rights, we need to verify your identity to confirm your rights. This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. In order to verify your identity, we may need to gather more personal data from you than we currently have.
SECURITY
We take appropriate reasonable security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of personal information. This includes the necessary physical, electronic and managerial procedures designed to protect data integrity, access and use. Please note that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. As a result, we strive to protect your personal information but cannot ensure or warrant the security of your information against any possible loss or unauthorized access.
