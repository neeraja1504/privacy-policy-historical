What we collect using cookies
Cookies may be used on our websites.  A cookie is a text-only string of information that a website transfers to the cookie file of the browser on your computer’s hard disk so that the website can remember who you are.  These cookies are known as your "Unique Visitor Cookie" and identify your visit only by a random number (e.g. #12489), the name of the domain from where the cookie has come and the “lifetime” of the cookie.
You can accept or decline our cookies by adjusting the "accept cookies" setting on your browser, however this may affect the functionality of our website on your browser.  For example, you may not be able to personalise features on our website if you decline our cookies.
What we collect from others
Other people might give us personal information about you.  For example, we might be given your personal information by your employer if they do business with us or by your parent/guardian if you are under 18.
We may also collect personal information from other companies that are able to disclose it to us, if it’s not practical to collect it from you. For example, we may obtain your personal information from various trusted sources in social media where you have indicated that you would like to buy our goods or services.
If we have received your personal information from a third party, we will take reasonable steps to make sure you know and consent to us having your personal information.
Using or disclosing information
We will use your personal information to meet the purpose for which it was provided and/or within the permission/consent you provided. We will use your information to provide you with our or third party goods or services, marketing materials (including direct marketing) and for use in planning, development and research.

If you don’t provide us with your information or consent, then we may not be able to do one or more of the above.
We may also disclose your personal information to protect the integrity of our website, goods or services or as authorised or required by or under law.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the privacy of information that is transmitted over the internet.
Who we share your information with
We may share your information with other members of our group of companies – The PAS Group. The PAS Group includes companies that run other well-known brands including, Review, Black Pepper, Marco Polo, Yarra Trail and Breakaway.
We will often need to pass your personal details (eg name and address) to companies that perform part of our service delivery. For example, Australia Post, delivery companies, mail houses and third party fulfilment contractors. These companies and persons would only get limited access to your personal information to complete their task.
Overseas based service providers and access to personal information
We work with overseas based service providers that help us conduct our business. For example, technical support for our marketing initiatives and they do it from countries like Canada, United Kingdom and the USA. They may have access to systems that include your personal information. Without them, we would not be able to provide you value and/or levels of services that you expect from us.
We take reasonable steps to ensure that any overseas recipient of personal information does not breach the Australian privacy principles.
Access and correction of information
If you would like to access, update, correct or decide that you don’t want us to hold any of your personal information, you may do so by, if applicable, logging on to our website and changing your preferences or details, or by emailing/writing to our Privacy Officer (details provided below).
If you do not want to receive direct marketing communications or any communications from us, then simply “opt out”, “unsubscribe” or change your details at our website.
Otherwise, please write to our Privacy Officer.
Security
We will take reasonable steps to protect your information from misuse, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.
Unfortunately, as no on line data transmission is ever completely secure, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of your personal information.
