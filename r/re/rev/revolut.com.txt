We may also collect any of the above information relating to your use of the Revolut Dashboard, the Revolut app and our website.
4. What is your legal basis for using my information?
We must have a legal basis (a valid legal reason) for using your personal information. Our legal basis will be one of the following.
Keeping to our contracts and agreements with you
We need certain personal information to provide our services and cannot provide them without this information.
Legal obligations
In some cases, we have a legal responsibility to collect and store your personal information (for example, under money-laundering laws we must hold certain information about our customers).
Legitimate interests
We sometimes collect and use your personal information, or share it with other organisations, because we or they have a legitimate reason to have it and this is reasonable when balanced against your right to privacy.
Consent

We have explained more about how we use your personal information in the How do you use my information? section below.
5. How do you use my information?
We collect your information so we can provide the best service, tell you about products and services you may be interested in, and meet our legal obligations.
Providing our services
Whenever you apply for a product or service, we will use your personal information to check your identity (as part of our KYC process) and decide whether or not to approve your application.
If you are already a Revolut customer, we use your personal information to meet our obligations relating to any transactions you make (for example, making payments into and out of your Revolut account, withdrawing cash or making payments with your Revolut Card).

* keeping to contracts and agreements between you and us;
* legitimate interests (to develop and improve how we deal with financial crime and meet our legal responsibilities); and/or
* legal obligations.

To help us do so, we may use information we hold about you in order better to understand your interests. You can opt out of this by using the in-app help service or by emailing our Data Protection Officer at the address given above;
* if you agree, allow our partners and other organisations to provide you with information about their goods or services;
* measure or understand the effectiveness of our advertising, and provide relevant advertising to you; or

* consent (for you to receive marketing from other organisations).

The legal basis would be one or both of the following:
* legitimate interests (to develop our products and services and to be efficient in meeting our obligations); and/or
* consent (to track you when you have location services switched on).

6. Do you carry out credit checks or make any automated decisions about me?
We will carry out a credit check if you apply for a credit product
We (and our lending partners) use credit-reference agencies to carry out credit checks on you. This means that when you apply for credit products, or we suggest credit products to you through the Revolut app, we can better understand your financial circumstances and repayment history, and can tailor our credit products to your needs.
Some of the searches leave a 'soft footprint' on your credit history. This means that the search will be registered on your credit file but will not be visible to others if they search your credit history. (Basically, you will be able to see this footprint but other people won't - see here for more information.) A soft footprint will not affect your credit rating. If you apply for credit, we will provide more information about this in the application form.
Some of our third-party providers, such as fraud-prevention agencies, may also use credit-reference agencies to help us check your identity and prevent fraud. These searches also only leave a trace on your credit history.
We do not accept joint account holders, but credit-reference agencies may sometimes link your credit record with that of anyone else who is financially connected to you.
Due to the international nature of our services, we use credit-reference agencies and fraud-prevention agencies in the UK and overseas.
Sometimes you may have a right to see your personal records held by credit-reference and fraud-prevention agencies. If you would like details of the credit-reference and fraud-prevention agencies we use, please contact us through the Revolut app or by sending an email to dpo@revolut.com.
You can withdraw your permission for credit checks by contacting us through the Revolut app.
The credit-reference agencies have created a joint document to explain how they use and share your information – you can see the here.
7. How do you use my information for marketing?
If you sign up to our services, we will assume you want us to contact you by post, email and phone (including text message) with offers and promotions. We may use the information we have collected about you in order to tailor our offers to you.
You can adjust your preferences, or tell us you don't want to hear from us, at any time. Just use the 'Privacy' section within the 'Profile' section of the Revolut app or click on the unsubscribe links on any marketing message we send you.
We won't pass your details on to any organisations outside the Revolut group of companies for their marketing purposes without your permission. You can find out more in the Do you share my information with anyone else? section.
Your rights
8. What are my rights?
Your right | What it means
---|---
You have the right to be informed about how we use your personal information. | We provide this privacy notice to explain how we use your personal information.
You can ask to see the personal information we hold about you (this is called making a ‘data subject access request’, or DSAR for short). You can also ask for information about what information we process and why. | If you make a DSAR, we will provide a copy of the personal information we hold about you. We can’t give you any information about other people, information which is linked to an ongoing criminal or fraud investigation, or information which is linked to settlement negotiations with you. We also won't provide you with any communication we've had with our legal advisers.
You can ask us to correct your personal information if you think it's wrong. | You can have incomplete or inaccurate information corrected. Before we update your file, we may need to check the accuracy of the new information you have provided.
You can ask us to delete your personal information. | You can ask us to delete your personal information if:
| ✓ there's no good reason for us to continue using it;
| ✓ you gave us consent to use the information and you have now withdrawn that consent;
| ✓ you have objected to us using the information;
| ✓ we have used the information unlawfully; or
| ✓ the law requires us to delete the information.
| Just to let you know, we may not be able to agree to your request. As a firm authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority, we must keep certain customer information for at least six years (we've explained this in more detail below). If you've closed your Revolut account, we may not be able to delete your entire file because these regulatory responsibilities take priority. We will always let you know if we can't delete your information.
You can object to us processing your personal information for marketing purposes. | You can tell us to stop using your personal information for marketing.
You can object to us processing other information (if we are using it for legitimate interests). | If our legal basis for using your personal information is 'legitimate interests' and you disagree with us using it, you can object.
| However, if there is an overriding reason why we need to use the information (for example, legal reasons), we will not accept your request.
| If you object to us using information which we need in order to provide our services, we may need to close your account as we won’t be able to provide the services.
| For example, if you object to us sending your personal information to our partners such as concierge providers (as part of our Premium and Metal plans), we may no longer be able to provide you with those concierge services.
You can ask us to restrict how we use your personal information | You can ask us to suspend using your personal information if:
| ✓ you want us to investigate whether it is accurate;
| ✓ our use of the information is unlawful but you do not want us to delete it;
| ✓ we no longer need the information, but you want us to continue holding it for you in connection with a legal claim; or
| ✓ you have objected to us using your information (see above), but we need to check whether we have an overriding reason to use it.
You can ask us to transfer personal information to you. | If we can, and are allowed to do so under regulatory requirements, we will provide your personal information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.
You can withdraw your permission. | If you have given us any consent we need to use your personal information, you can withdraw your consent at any time by changing your settings in the Revolut app (or sending an email to dpo@revolut.com).
| (Note, it will have been lawful for us to user the personal information up to the point you withdrew your permission).
9. How do I exercise my rights?
To exercise any of your rights set out in the previous section, you can contact us through the Revolut app or send us an email at dpo@revolut.com.
For security reasons, we can't deal with your request if we are not sure of your identity, so we may ask you for proof of your ID.
If you are unhappy with how we have handled your personal information you can complain to the ICO through their website.
Revolut group companies
We share your personal information within the Revolut group of companies in order to provide you with the best service.
For example, we may share your information with Revolut Travel Ltd, in order to provide you with insurance mediation services (for example when we offer overseas medical insurance as part of a Premium or Metal plan).
Suppliers
The table below explains which suppliers we normally share your personal information with.
Type of Supplier | Why we share your information
---|---
Suppliers who provide us with IT, payment and delivery services | To help us provide our services to you

Analytics providers and search information providers | To help us improve our website
Customer service providers, survey providers and developers | To help us to provide our services to you
Communications services providers | To help us send you emails, push notifications and text messages
Partners who help to provide our services
We may share your personal information with our partners in order to provide you with certain services you have asked us for.
If you are a business customer, we may share your personal information with our integrated partners (via the Revolut for Business API) when you switch this function on through Revolut Connect.
Here's an example of when we might share your information with our partners
If you have asked for concierge services, we will share relevant information to the provider of the concierge service.
We will only share your personal information in this way if you have asked for the relevant service. You can withdraw your permission at any time by contacting us through the Revolut app. However, this may affect your ability to continue to use those services.
From time to time we may work with other partners to offer you co-branded services or promotional offers, and we will share some of your personal information with those partners. We will always get your consent before sharing your information for these purposes. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us through the Revolut app.
Our partners will have their own privacy notice explaining how they use your personal information. It's important that you read those privacy notices as well.
Credit-reference agencies
If you apply for a credit product, we'll share your personal information with credit-reference agencies to check whether you are likely to make repayments when due.
For legal reasons
We also share your personal information with fraud-prevention agencies to check your identity, protect against fraud, keep to anti-money-laundering laws and confirm that you are eligible to use our products and services.
Here's an example of when we might share your personal information for legal reasons
If you give us false or inaccurate information and we identify fraud, we will let fraud-prevention agencies know. Law-enforcement agencies may check and use this information.
If fraud is detected, you could be refused certain services, finance or employment. You can contact us through the Revolut app to ask for more details of how your information will be used by us and these fraud-prevention agencies.
Some fraud-prevention agencies have created a document to explain how they use and share your information - you can see this here.
We may also need to share your personal information with other third-party organisations:
if we have to do so under any law or regulation;
if we sell our business;
in connection with criminal or fraud investigations;
to enforce our rights (and those of customers or others); or
in connection with legal claims.
Revolut & your personal information
11. Will my information go outside Europe?
As we provide an international service, we may need to transfer your personal information outside the European Economic Area (EEA) in order for us to provide our services.
For example, if you ask to make an international payment, we will send funds to banks overseas. We might also send your information overseas to keep to global legal and regulatory requirements, and to provide ongoing support services.
We may share your personal information with credit-reference agencies and fraud-prevention agencies outside the UK. (You can read more about this in the Do you carry out credit checks or any make any automated decisions about me? section above).
We will take all reasonable steps to make sure that your personal information is handled securely and in line with this privacy notice and data-protection laws.
If you would like more information, please contact us through the Revolut app or by sending an email to dpo@revolut.com.
12. How do you protect my personal information?
We store your information on our secure servers.
Any payment transactions carried out by us or our payment-processing providers will be encrypted using Secured Sockets Layer technology or a secure virtual private network.
If you use a password for the Revolut app or our website, you will need to keep this password confidential. Please do not share it with anyone.
Unfortunately, providing information online is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee that all information you provide through the Revolut app or our website will be secure. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.
When you use our services, which include social networking, chat room or forum features, do not share any personal information that you don't want to be seen, collected or used by other users, as this information will become publicly available.
13. How long will you keep my personal information for?
Under anti-money laundering laws we need to hold information about you and your transactions for five years.
You have the right to redeem your e-money for up to six years after your Revolut account is closed. We will therefore hold your information for this long.
Generally, we will not hold your personal information for more than six years after our business relationship with you has ended, unless we need to hold it for longer because of a potential or ongoing claim or another legal reason.
14. How will you keep me updated on how you use my information?
If we change the way we use your personal information, we will update this notice and, if appropriate, let you know by text message, by email, through the Revolut app or through our website.
15. Cookies
We use cookies to analyse how you use our website. Please read the Cookies Policy for more information about cookies.
