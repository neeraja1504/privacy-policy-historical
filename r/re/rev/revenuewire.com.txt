Information Collection
When you submit information to open an account to either offer your digital download product for sale through the RevenueWire services or you open an account to purchase or promote any products that are being offered by RevenueWire, we may collect personal information including without limitation your name, address, email address, and phone number for the purpose of establishing an account with RevenueWire, the collection of billing information for transaction processing, and recording the transactions when you engage in activities on our web site or through the RevenueWire services.

When creating an account as an Affiliate or Merchant on our site, if you wish to have payments wired to your bank account, we will ask you to submit Bank Account information to us in order to facilitate these payments. The Bank Account information you submit to us is sensitive information and is therefore protected by us using industry-standard SSL Encryption.

We may provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities such as shipping your order or offering customer service. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.
