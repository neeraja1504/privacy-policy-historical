Revlo Privacy Policy
Last Updated: 09.23.2015
[Revlo] (“Revlo,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Notice sets out the manner in which Revlo collects, uses, discloses and otherwise manages personal information. This Privacy Notice applies to the privacy practices of Revlo, including on the website www.revlo.co (the “Website”).
Collection and Use of Personal Information
Revlo offers a personal loyalty program administration service for broadcasters on Twitch.tv (“Twitch”). Broadcasters can customize a loyalty program that provides viewers with points that can then be redeemed for rewards offered by the broadcaster on Twitch or on the Website.
If you are a broadcaster and use Revlo to create a personal loyalty program:
To register as a Revlo user, we will collect your Twitch username and email address. We use this information to administer your account and communicate with you about the service.
We may also use your email address to send you bi-weekly newsletters about Revlo’s products and services. You can opt-out of receiving our newsletter at any time by following the instructions in each of these communications.
As a registered Revlo user, you will have access to a Dashboard where you can review the details of your account, set certain preferences and edit your personal details (such as your username, the details of your loyalty program, currency and notifications settings). We use the information you provide on the Dashboard in order to deliver the loyalty program services you request.
We use a bot on Twitch in order to collect information about your Twitch account (such as the number of your viewers, followers and subscribers) and information about your Twitch usage (when you stream, and how long and often you stream). We use this information to understand our users and improve our product and service offering.
If you are a viewer and participate in a broadcaster’s loyalty program:
On behalf of broadcaster, we use a bot to collect your Twitch user name and interactions with the broadcaster’s channel on Twitch (such as length of watching time per session and amount of interaction on stream). This information is used to reward and redeem points and to otherwise administer the loyalty program on behalf of the broadcaster. We may also collect the types of games you watch and when you typically watch games. We use this information to understand our users and improve our product and service offering.
The broadcaster may permit you to redeem points on our Website in addition to on Twitch. Depending on the rewards offered by the broadcaster, we may also collect additional information from you for the purposes of facilitating the point redemption. For example, we may collect your mailing address so that the broadcaster can send your reward by mail or the name of a charity so that the broadcaster can donate to the charity of your choice.
If you are a viewer or broadcaster:
When you contact us with a comment, question or complaint, you may be asked for information that identifies you (such as your name, address and a telephone number) along with additional information we need to help us promptly answer your question or respond to your comment. We may also retain this information to assist you in the future and to improve our customer service, product and service offerings, and events and promotions.
