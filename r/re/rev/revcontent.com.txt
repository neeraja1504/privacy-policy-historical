Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies We Use to Collect Information
We use various technologies to collect information, including cookies, web beacons, web storage, unique device identifiers, and similar technologies.  Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory that help us to tailor recommendations and promoted content to your preferences over time.  For example, we may use your web browsing information to show you specific recommendations and sponsored recommendations that we think will be of particular interest to you.  We may also collect information using web beacons (also known as "tracking pixels").  Web beacons are electronic images that may be used in our Services and help perform a variety of functions, including delivering cookies, counting visits, and understanding usage.  For more information about cookies, and how to disable them, please see "Your Choices" below.

SHARING OF INFORMATION
We may share the information we collect as follows or as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy:
With vendors, consultants and other service providers who need access to such information to carry out work or perform services on our behalf;
In response to a request for information if we believe disclosure is in accordance with, or required by, any applicable law, rule, regulation or legal process;
If we believe your actions are inconsistent with our user agreements or policies, or to protect the rights, property or safety of Revcontent or others;
In connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company;
Between and among Revcontent and any current or future parent, subsidiary and/or affiliated company; and

DATA RETENTION
We store the information we collect for as long as is necessary for the purpose(s) for which we originally collected it. We may retain certain information for legitimate business purposes or as required by law.
DATA TRANSFERS AND PRIVACY SHIELD
Revcontent is based in the U.S.  As such, we and our service providers may transfer your information to, or store or access it in, jurisdictions that may not provide equivalent levels of data protection as your home jurisdiction.  We will take steps to ensure that your personal data receives an adequate level of protection in the jurisdictions in which we process it.
When we transfer personal data from the European Union or Switzerland to the United States, we comply with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss - U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States, respectively.
Revcontent has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/.
In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, we are committed to resolving complaints about our processing of your personal data. EU and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our compliance with the Privacy Shield program should first contact us at privacy@revcontent.com  We have further committed to refer unresolved Privacy Shield complaints to JAMS, an alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your complaint to your satisfaction, please contact or visit https://www.jamsadr.com/file-an-eu-us-privacy-shield-or-safe-harbor-claim for more information or to file a complaint. The services of JAMS are provided at no cost to you. Under certain conditions, you may be able to invoke binding arbitration to resolve your complaint. Revcontent is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission.
If we share personal data transferred to the U.S. under the Privacy Shield with a third-party service provider that processes such data on our behalf, then we will be liable for that third party’s processing in violation of the Privacy Shield Principles, unless we can prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
HOW WE PROTECT THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT
We take reasonable measures to help protect the information we collect from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration
and destruction.  However, no transmission over the internet or electronic storage can be completely secure, so we cannot guarantee the absolute security of any data.
RESIDENTS OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA
If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (“EEA”), you have certain rights and protections under the law regarding the processing of your personal data.
Legal Basis for Processing
If you are a resident of the EEA, when we process your personal data we will only do so in the following situations:
We need to use your personal data to perform our responsibilities under our contract with you (e.g., processing payments for and providing the services you have requested).
We have a legitimate interest in processing your personal data. For example, we may process your personal data to provide content and advertisements that may be of interest to you, to communicate with you about changes to our Services, and to provide, secure, and improve our Services.
There is another applicable lawful basis under which we are permitted to process your personal data.
Data Subject Requests
If you are a resident of the EEA, you have the right to access personal data we hold about you and to ask that your personal data be corrected, erased, or transferred.  You may also have the right to object to, or request that we restrict, certain processing.  If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please contact us at privacy@revcontent.com
