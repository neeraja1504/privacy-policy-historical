We may also transfer that information to our affiliates and subsidiaries or to other third parties, across borders to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. If you are visiting from the European Economic Area or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that you may be transferring your Personal Data to the United States, which does not have the same data protection laws as the EU or other countries.
We maintain appropriate safeguards to properly protect Personal Data concerning you when it is transferred to the United States.

As stated elsewhere in this privacy policy, we do not share Personal Data with third parties for their direct marketing purposes, as defined by California Civil Code Section 1798.83, unless we give you choice (opt-in or opt-out) before sharing with those third parties.
Accuracy of Personal Data and your Individual Rights:
While we take various steps to ensure the accuracy and completeness of your Personal Data, we rely upon you to provide accurate and complete Personal Data when interacting with us. You may also have the legal right, for example if you are using the Services from the EU, to request:
Obtain from us confirmation as to whether or not we process Personal Data from you and, where that is the case, access to your Personal Data;
Rectification of inaccurate Personal Data;
Erasure of Personal Data;
Objection to the processing of Personal Data;
Restriction of processing of Personal Data; and
Portability of Personal Data - receive the Personal Data you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable form and transmit those data it to another entity.
Also, where our processing of your Personal Data is based on your consent, you may withdraw consent at any time for the future. Please note that withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before the withdrawal.
Any such requests should be submitted by email to compliance@groupninemedia.com.
Please see for additional information: https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/reform/rights-citizens_en.
If you are using the Services from the EU, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with an EU supervisory authority if you do not think we are handling your Personal Data in compliance with applicable law. However, if you have a complaint regarding the processing of your Personal Data we kindly request that you first contact us directly by sending us an email at compliance@groupninemedia.com, and we will reply promptly.
How Long We Keep Your Personal Data:
We consider several factors to determine how long we keep Personal Data. We consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Data, the purposes for which we process your Personal Data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. Once we no longer have a need for your Personal Data, we will securely destroy it in accordance with our standards and applicable laws and regulations.
We will attempt to honor requests to delete your Personal Data, but please note that we may be required to keep such information for legal purposes and not delete it (or to keep this information for a certain time, in which case we will comply with your deletion request only after we have fulfilled such requirements). When we delete any information, it will be deleted from the active database, but may remain in our archives. We may also retain your information for fraud or similar purposes.
How We Protect Personal Data:
We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to assist us in protecting the Personal Data we collect against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use. We also limit access to Personal Data about you to employees or service providers who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that Personal Data to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.
While we implement these and other security measures on our Services, please note that 100% security is not always possible. We cannot guarantee that the security measures we have in place to safeguard Personal Data will never be defeated or fail, or that those measures will always be sufficient or effective.
Children’s Privacy:
We especially care about the privacy of young children. Accordingly, we do not direct our websites to children under the age of sixteen or knowingly collect Personal Data from them. If we learn that a user is under sixteen years of age, we will promptly delete any Personal Data that the individual has provided to us.
Enforcement and More Information:
When GNM receives formal written inquiries or complaints, GNM will contact the individual regarding his/her concerns. We will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the handling of Personal Data that cannot be resolved between GNM and an individual.

Without prejudice to your rights under applicable law, this Privacy Policy may be updated periodically and without prior notice to you to reflect changes in our Personal Data practices. We will notify you of changes to our Privacy Policy in advance by posting the new Privacy Policy here and updating the “Last Updated” date above.
