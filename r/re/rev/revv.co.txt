Last modified: September 5, 2017
We (meaning Revv, LLC) collect certain information through our website, located at  revv.co  and/or our mobile applications, other platforms that connect to our website and/or mobile applications, and the products and services provided at our website and/or mobile applications, all as now existing or as may exist in the future (the “Platform”). This page (this “Privacy Policy”) lays out our policies and procedures surrounding the collection and handling of any information that can be directly associated with an individual, whether or not they create an account on the Platform, and includes personal information such as names, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, etc. (“Personal Information”).
This Privacy Policy applies only to our Platform. It does not apply to any third party site or service linked to our Platform or recommended or referred by our Platform, through our products or services, or by our staff. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any other website, product, or service operated by our company, or to any of our offline activities.
Personnal Information We Collect.  We collect the following information provided from users or through user’s use of the Platform: name, e-mail address, telephone number, address, occupation, employer, employer’s address, contribution amount, contribution recipients, and credit card information. We may also collect additional information on behalf of our clients upon their request. As such, you should be aware that if a client of ours customizes information collected by the Platform, we will collect and store that information as well.
Non-Personal Information We May Collect.  We may also collect information about your device type, browser, usage behavior, IP address, websites from which you came to the Platform, or websites to which you depart from the Platform. We may also collect additional information on behalf of our clients upon their request.
Contribution Information.  We share information, potentially including Personal Information, concerning the contributions you make using the Platform with each candidate, committee, or organization (“Organization”) to which you made the contribution so that each Organization receiving your donations may include this information in their regulatory reports. The FEC reports containing this information are publicly available from the FEC web site. State reports are typically available through the state agency designated to oversee campaigns and elections. Often, Organizations use third parties to manage, among other things, their campaigns for contributions, including their Revv account. For purposes of this Privacy Policy, such third parties are included within the definition of “Organizations.” Organizations may receive reports about donations made through the forms they create. These reports include such items as your Personal Information and the dates, amounts, and recipients of contributions.
Credit Card Information.  We outsource processing of credit card transactions to Stripe. We securely transmit your credit card information to Stripe (our payment processor). Stripe, however, does store this information. Stripe maintains that it is PCI compliant. We also store the last four digits of your credit card and the brand of the credit card. We also request your phone number and email address when you contribute so that we can reach you should further verification of your credit card information be required. Stripe uses Personal Information, including credit card information, you provide. Please visit Stripe’s privacy policy for information regarding Stripe’s collection, use, and transfer of Personal Information, currently available at  stripe.com/us/privacy. Please see Stripe’s security policy for additional information regarding Stripe’s security measures, currently available at  stripe.com/help/security.
We request your phone number and email address when you contribute so that we can reach you should further verification of your credit card information be required. Other than the last four digits of your credit card and the brand of the credit card, Revv does not store, process, or transmit any other cardholder data in electronic format and is in compliance with SAQ A data security standards issued by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council.
