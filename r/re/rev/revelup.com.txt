Last Updated: May 24, 2018
This Privacy Policy applies to all products and services offered by Revel Systems, Inc., and our affiliates (collectively “Revel”, “we”, “us” or “our”), including our websites, products, services, mobile and software applications we own or control (the “Services”).
Our Privacy Policy does not apply to products or services offered by other companies or individuals, such as ** ** payment processing services, hardware, third-party software, or ISP services that customers may use in connection with the Services, including such third-party products or services that a customer may lease or procure through Revel. **  **Our Privacy Policy also does not apply to data that we process as a service provider on behalf of our customers, as our handling of this data is governed by the contract with our customer.
Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what data we collect, why we collect it and what we do with it.

We also may use a third-party payment service to collect payment information to process your transactions with us.
