The information collection, use, and dissemination practices of AFFILIATE SUMMIT:
This policy applies to AFFILIATE SUMMITâ€™s collection, use, storage and disclosure of information by AFFILIATE SUMMIT on its (a) websites, including all its divisions, subsidiaries and related companies (collectively, the â€œWebsitesâ€), (b) on various third party websites, and (c) to AFFILIATE SUMMITâ€™s other information collection, including the purchase of customer lists from third parties. AFFILIATE SUMMIT is not responsible for the information collection or privacy practices of third web sites or applications.
1. Collection of Information.
1.1 Survey Information.
AFFILIATE SUMMIT collects information from individuals by various methods, including, but not limited to, when an individual voluntarily completes an AFFILIATE SUMMIT survey, order form, or a registration page either online or offline, or by means of online or offline surveys, order forms, or registration pages operated by third parties (collectively, a â€œSurveyâ€). (As used herein, â€œonlineâ€ means using the Internet, including the Websites, and related technologies, and â€œofflineâ€ means by methods other than online, including in person, in the postal mail, using telephones and cell phones, and other similar means.) In the Surveys, AFFILIATE SUMMIT or a third party (a â€œThird Partyâ€) may ask an individual to provide various information to AFFILIATE SUMMIT, which may include his or her name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, social security number, employment information, personal and online interests, and such other information as may be requested from time to time (together, â€œSurvey Informationâ€). AFFILIATE SUMMIT may also collect information concerning an individual from another source and uses that information in combination with information provided from this web site. Completing the Surveys is completely voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to provide Survey Information to AFFILIATE SUMMIT or Third Party, but an individual may receive incentives from AFFILIATE SUMMIT or a Third Party in exchange for providing Survey Information to AFFILIATE SUMMIT.
1.2 Third Party List Information.
AFFILIATE SUMMIT collects information from individuals when an individual provides information to a third party and AFFILIATE SUMMIT subsequently purchases, licenses, or otherwise acquires the information from the third party (the â€œSellerâ€). Such purchased information may include, but is not limited to, an individualâ€™s name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, industry of employment, personal and online interests, and such other information as the individual may have provided to the Seller (together, â€œThird Party List Informationâ€). When acquiring Third Party List Information, AFFILIATE SUMMIT seeks assurances from the Seller that the Seller has a right to transfer the Third Party List Information to AFFILIATE SUMMIT and that the Seller has a right to provide offers from advertisers to the individuals whose personal information is included on the Sellerâ€™s list.
1.3 Other Information.
Other occasions when AFFILIATE SUMMIT obtains information from individuals include (1) when an individual is making a claim for a prize or seeking to redeem an incentive offered by AFFILIATE SUMMIT or by a third party, (2) when an individual requests assistance through AFFILIATE SUMMIT customer service department, and (3) when an individual voluntarily subscribes to a AFFILIATE SUMMIT service or newsletter (together, â€œOther Informationâ€).
1.4 Cookies, Pixel Tags, and Other Info Collected Using Technology.
AFFILIATE SUMMIT currently uses cookie and pixel tag technology to associate certain Internet-related information about an individual with information about the individual in our database. Additionally, AFFILIATE SUMMIT may use other new and evolving sources of information in the future (together, â€œTechnology Informationâ€).
(a) Cookies.
A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individualâ€™s computer that allows AFFILIATE SUMMIT to identify the individual with his or her corresponding data that resides in AFFILIATE SUMMIT database. You may read more about cookies at http://cookiecentral.com. Individuals who use the Websites need to accept cookies in order to use all of the features and functionality of the Websites.
(b) Pixel Tags.
A pixel tag is programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page (by using an programming function â€” see http://truste.org for more information), but can also be used to transfer an individualâ€™s unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows AFFILIATE SUMMIT to track certain web sites an individual visits online.
(c) New Technology.
The use of technology on the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly evolving, as is AFFILIATE SUMMITâ€™s use of new and evolving technology. As a result, AFFILIATE SUMMIT strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use of technology.
1.5 Outside Information.
AFFILIATE SUMMIT may receive information about individuals from third parties or from other sources of information outside of AFFILIATE SUMMIT including information located in public databases (â€œOutside Informationâ€).
1.6 Individual Information.
As used herein, Individual Information means Survey Information, Third Party List Information, Other Information, Technology Information, and Outside Information, and any other information AFFILIATE SUMMIT gathers or receives about individuals.
1.7 No Information Collected from Children.
AFFILIATE SUMMIT will never knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of 13. If AFFILIATE SUMMIT obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personal information about a child under the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted from our database. Because it does not collect such information, AFFILIATE SUMMIT has no such information to use or to disclose to third parties. AFFILIATE SUMMIT has designed this policy in order to comply with the Childrenâ€™s Online Privacy Protection Act (â€œCOPPAâ€).
1.8 Credit Card Information.
AFFILIATE SUMMIT may in certain cases collect credit card numbers and related information, such as the expiration date of the card (â€œCredit Card Informationâ€) when an individual places an order from AFFILIATE SUMMIT. When the Credit Card Information is submitted to AFFILIATE SUMMIT, such information is encrypted and is protected with SSL encryption software. AFFILIATE SUMMIT will use the Credit Card Information for purposes of processing and completing the purchase transaction, and the Credit Card Information will be disclosed to third parties only as necessary to complete the purchase transaction.
