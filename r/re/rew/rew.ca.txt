REW.CA™ has established this Privacy Policy to explain how it protects and manages the personal information that it collects from you (the customer) online.
REW.CA may change this policy from time to time by updating this page. It is recommended that you check this page from time to time to ensure that you are aware and comfortable with any changes. This policy is effective from the 1st July 2014.
1. Consent for Collection, Use and Disclosure
Your use of the REW.CA site and/or your registration for REW.CA products and services constitute your consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the REW.CA site.
REW.CA may occasionally update this Privacy Policy. When it does, REW.CA will also revise the "last update" date at the top of this Privacy Policy. In addition, REW.CA will seek a customer's prior consent, by email, for any new uses or proposed disclosures of information collected from the customer prior to the change. REW.CA will notify customers by email of changes to this policy that will affect information collected from them in the future. In certain circumstances, however, REW.CA will not inform and obtain the consent of the customer, such as in connection with an investigation of a breach of an agreement, contravention of laws, an emergency where the life, health or security of an individual is threatened, the collection of a debt or in compliance with the request of a law enforcement agency or a court order.
A customer may withdraw his or her consent for collection, use and disclosure at any time by sending an email to [email protected] Please note that, if you do, REW.CA may suspend its provision of products and services to you.

REW.CA has implemented this Privacy Policy to protect personal information received from its customers, and to respond to any inquiries. The Privacy Policy also provides that REW.CA will use appropriate contractual means to establish a comparable level of protection for personal information which is sent for processing by third parties on REW.CA's behalf.
REW.CA has designated responsibility for your personal information to its Privacy Officer, who ensures compliance with the principles in this Privacy Policy. Other REW.CA individuals may be delegated to act on behalf of the Privacy Officer.

4. to respond to judicial process and provide information to law enforcement agencies or in connection with an investigation on matters related to public safety, as permitted by law, or otherwise as required by law.

In such transactions, personal information may be one of the transferred business assets.
