Privacy Policy
Ipsos Stat FZ - LLC is a company registered in the UAE. Ipsos Stat is part of the Ipsos worldwide group of companies. This privacy policy explains how we use any personal information we collect about you when you join our on-line panel, take part in surveys, or use the panel members website.
We offer a refer-a-friend feature on our websites, which enables existing members of our panel to invite their friends to join the panel. This process allows the member to enter their friend’s first name and email address into our system, which then sends an automated email message to the friend's email address which includes the registration link to join their panel. As a result, we may obtain your first name and email address from an existing panel member who has asked us to send you an invitation to join the panel. All automated email messages sent to the friend’s email address will include an opt-out link to allow the friend to opt-out of receiving any further emails from us. We limit the number of referrals to five (5) per month.
We collect the information you provide by email and in completing our recruitment questionnaire, when you decide to join our panel.
We collect your Facebook basic profile information (meaning your name, e-mail address, and gender) that you have consented to our using when you connect to, and use the Rewarding Panel Facebook Application within your Facebook account, or you use the “Join using Facebook” or “Login with Facebook” buttons on the panel website.

Some on-line surveys collect information through the use of 'cookies'. These are small files stored on your computer. These files are used as sparingly as possible and only for quality control, validation and, more importantly, to prevent us sending you reminders for any on-line survey you have already completed. It is possible for you to delete 'cookies' or to prevent their use by adjusting the browser settings on your computer.
In addition to our use of cookies, our online surveys automatically capture information about your IP Address, operating system, screen display settings, browser type, and use of Flash and Java. We use this information to:
ensure that the survey questionnaire is delivered in a form suited to the software your computer is using.
assist in providing support to you should you have difficulty accessing or completing a survey.
anonymised information is also used for research purposes, for example to determine the percentage of our panelists in a specific country who use a certain type of browser.
With your prior agreement, we may also install advanced cookies or similar code that can identify tags attached to certain web-sites or on-line advertisements relating to our clients and/or their products. Alternatively, again with your prior agreement, we may scan for and read cookies or code installed by other websites that you may have visited. The information obtained in this way will be used to help us send you surveys that are relevant to you (for example, you may be asked your opinion on ads that you've actually seen), or for other research into internet usage.
5. Use of Digital fingerprinting
We also use digital fingerprinting technology, also known as "Machine Identification" digital fingerprints, to gather certain information about your computer hardware and software, for example, your IP address, the display settings of your monitor, the type of browser you are using, the type of operating system you are using, etc. This information is sent to our trusted third-party partner who converts it into a unique serial number – the digital "fingerprint" – and determines if it matches previous fingerprints. The data collected in this process and the digital fingerprint created is not tied to any of your personal information, is stored on secured servers, and is only used for quality control purposes and to help prevent panelists from completing the same survey many times, and for no other purpose.
6. How long will we keep the information you provide?
We will keep the information you provided when you joined our panel, together with any information you provided in response to a recruitment questionnaire for as long as you remain a member of the panel. You can leave the panel at any time you wish. We may also remove you from our panel if you are not taking part in any surveys, are no longer eligible to be a member of any other reason, or the panel is closed. Before removing anyone from our panel, we will contact them to let them know and provide details of how to remain a panel member where appropriate. However, in the event we consider you breach Rewarding Panel’s rules or terms and conditions, Rewarding Panel may remove you from our panel without any notice and your access to the panelist website and to your points account will be closed.
When you leave the panel you will be unsubscribed, or the panel is closed, we will delete all your contact details, together with any other information that could be used to identify you, leaving only anonymous responses to surveys that you participated in.
