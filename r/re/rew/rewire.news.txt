Privacy Policy - Rewire.News
Last updated May 25, 2018
Privacy Policy
Rewire.News wants to ensure that visitors to our site understand what information we gather about them, how we use it, and how we work to protect it.  By using our website, and/or signing up for services such as our newsletter, you consent to information practices outlined in our Privacy Policy.
Information Collection
We track how our visitors use this site so that we can see what people like and don’t like. We also analyze and aggregate information about use patterns and may share the aggregated data with our consultants, funders and others involved with Rewire.News. We may also collect personal information about you via registration for newsletters, commenting, making donations, interaction with external social networks and platforms, remarketing and behavioral targeting, displaying content from external platforms, and other areas. Where you have an opportunity to supply information about yourself, you may choose not to provide requested information, but in such cases you may not be able to use certain functions on this website.
We will not release your name, email address or any other personal information to anyone outside Rewire.News without your consent, unless we are under a legal order to do so or there is an emergency involving danger to a person or property.
If you chose to provide your personally identifiable information for the purposes of a third-party contest, survey or newsletter, your consent shall be deemed to be given for the release of your personally identifiable information with regard to that third party only, in addition to Rewire.News. Only authorized Rewire.News employees or consultants are allowed access to personal information about you. Any employee or consultant who violates our privacy and security policies is subject to disciplinary action.
We occasionally have service contractors, third party agents, subsidiaries, affiliates, and/or joint ventures that perform functions on our behalf, including but not limited to credit card processing and website hosting. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, and are contractually obligated to maintain the confidentiality and security of the data. They are restricted from using or altering this data in anyway other than to provide the requested services to Rewire.News. In addition, we may always share, disclose, and transfer all information, postings, and any and all other personal and non-personal information we have collected to a successor-entity in the case of the sale of the assets of Rewire.News , corporate reorganization, merger, change in control, or other similar transaction.
Remember that any information you share in public areas, such as the Rewire.News comments area, becomes public and therefore this Privacy Policy does not apply to any information you choose to make public. We encourage visitors to Rewire.News to be cautious about what they disclose and that they do not post any personal information that they expect to keep private. Personally Identifiable Information is information that can be used to contact you or determine your specific identity.  If other information is linked to this information, it also becomes Personally Identifiable Information.
Use and Disclosure of Anonymous Information
Anonymous Information is any information other than Personally Identifiable Information, including aggregate information derived from Personally Identifiable Information.
Rewire.News may use this information:
To improve the Rewire.News website and service, to monitor traffic and general usage patterns, and for other general business purposes.
To inform publishers as to what content is appealing to readers, to inform Rewire.News stakeholders of the usage habits or characteristics of the interested audience, and to advise potential donors so that they may better understand Rewire.News ’ user base.
Cookies
A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier that is sent to your browser from a website’s servers and stored on your computer. Each website can send its own cookies to your browser if your browser’s preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) most browsers only permit a website to access the cookies that the same website has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites.
Rewire.News may use cookies to identify you as a repeat visitor or customer of the website, to maintain session information for logged in users, and to track usage trends and patterns in order to better understand and improve areas of our website.
Rewire.News has no control over whether and how any sites we link to use cookies that originate from their website. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but you may not be able to take full advantage of our site’s features.
We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf.  These companies may employ cookies and action tags to measure advertising effectiveness. All computers and servers on the internet use IP addresses to recognize and communicate with each other. We collect IP addresses to administer and analyze our site and report aggregate, non-personal information (such as how many visitors we have). When you call up our site on your computer, our servers enter the IP address of that computer into a log. To maintain our users’ anonymity, we do not associate IP addresses with records containing personal information.
We do not and cannot use cookies or IP address tracking to retrieve personal information from your computer.
View our Cookie Policy for more specific information about exactly what cookies Rewire.News uses and why.
Security
Rewire.News employs a number of security methods designed to prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure correct use of information. Your personal data will be stored within a database that is located behind a firewall for added security.
No data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be secure.  As a result, while we try to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. We are not liable for the illegal acts of any third party.
We use SSL to encrypt all web sessions to help protect user privacy and data.
Links to Other Sites
Rewire.News provides links and pointers to websites maintained by other organizations. Rewire.News provides these links as a convenience to users, but it does not operate or control such sites. Rewire.News also disclaims any responsibility for the information on those sites and any products or services offered there, and cannot vouch for the privacy policies of such sites. Rewire.News does not make any warranties or representations that any linked sites, or this site, will function without error or interruption, that defects will be corrected, or that the sites and their servers are free of viruses and other problems that can harm your computer.

Rewire.News is not directed to children (persons under the age of 13), and we do not knowingly collect, either online or offline, Personally Identifiable Information from children. If you believe that we have received information from a person under 13, please contact us via our contact form or in writing at Rewire.News , 7315 Wisconsin Ave., Ste. 400W, Bethesda, MD 20814, and we will take appropriate action.
