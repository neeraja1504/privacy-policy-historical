OPPO collects information for more efficient operations and provides you with the best product experience. Our channels for collecting personal information include: (1) the information directly provided by you; (2) the data we record on how you interact with our products; and/or (3) your data obtained from third parties. The information we collect depends on the environment in which you interact with OPPO, the choices you make (including your privacy settings), and the products and features you use.  It is worth noting that we usually identify the delivery area recorded in the mobile phone package box as the actual use place of the mobile phone, and comply with local laws and regulations, including data protection.
The personal information we collect includes:
1. In order to provide you with realme account registration and login services, we need to collect your mobile phone number or email address, password, user name, avatar and gender. Among them, the mobile phone number or the email address or password are necessary for account registration or login. If you do not provide the above information, we will not be able to provide you with an account registration or login service;
2. Depending on the legal requirements of your country, we may also collect your date of birth to determine whether you are a minor;
3. If your country's relevant laws and regulations have real name authentication provisions, we will also collect your real name authentication information, such as your name and identity card number;
4. To ensure the security of your account, we need to collect your login address, IP, device information (such as IMEI), emergency contact information for each time, and record your acts during the account login (such as change of password, change of binding mobile phone number, email number or complaint record);

8. In order to optimize product features and customize your user experience, we need to obtain your operational behavior data, such as product feature usage statistics.
We will ask your consent in advance when we wish to use the information for other purposes not specified in this Policy. When we want to use the information collected for a specific purpose for other purposes, we will seek your prior consent. We will not provide the user’s personal information and behavior data to third parties without the user’s consent.
IV How do we keep your personal information
Our retention period for personal information is the minimum time required to achieve the purpose of collection, unless the law requires a longer retention period. When the above retention period is exceeded, we will delete or anonymize your personal information.
V How do we disclose your personal information
1. OPPO may from time to time share some of the personal information with its affiliates and strategic partners who work with OPPO to deliver products and services, so as to provide the product or service that you require. Your personal information will not be shared with a third party for its own marketing or commercial purposes.
(1) Affiliate: Your personal information may be shared with OPPO’s affiliates. We only share the necessary personal information and are bound by the stated purposes of this Privacy Policy. If the affiliate wants to change the purpose of processing personal information, it will seek for your authorization again.
(2) Share with authorized partners: Some of our services will be provided by authorized partners only for the purposes stated in this Policy. We may share some of your personal information with our partners to provide better customer service and user experience. Our authorized partners include but are not limited to logistics companies, cloud service providers, technical service providers, etc. For example, when we need to deliver an event prize for you, we will inform the logistics company of the contact information you have reserved for such event so as to complete the delivery.
(3) In the case of merger, acquisition or bankruptcy liquidation, if personal information transfer is involved, we will require new companies and organizations that hold your personal information to continue to be bound by this Privacy Policy. Otherwise, we will ask the company and organization to seek your authorization again.
We only share your personal information for legitimate, rightful, necessary, specific, and explicit purposes, and only share the personal information necessary to provide the service. Our partners do not have the right to use shared personal information for any other purpose.
2. We will publicly disclose your personal information in the following circumstances:
(1) With your express consent;
(2) Disclosure on the basis of law: In cases where there is a mandatory requirement to comply with subpoena or other legal proceedings, litigation or mandatory requirements of the competent governmental authority, we may disclose your personal information if we sincerely believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraudulent acts or respond to government requests.
VI How do we protect your personal information
1. We have taken reasonable and feasible measures and technical measures to protect the information collected in relation to services. Please note that while we have taken reasonable steps to protect your information, no website, Internet transmission, computer system, or wireless connection is absolutely secure.
2. We have protected your personal information with industry-standard security measures from unauthorized access, public disclosure, use, modification, damage or loss of data We will take all reasonable and feasible measures to protect your personal information, including:
(1) We use technologies such as SSL to encrypt many services. Practices in the collection, storage and processing of information (including physical security measures) are regularly reviewed to avoid unauthorized access to various systems.
(2) We only allow access to personal information by OPPO employees who need to know that information in order to process it for us, and to people from the service companies authorized to process it. They are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations. If they fail to comply with these obligations, they may be held liable or their relationship with the OPPO may be terminated.
(3) The security of your information is very important to us. Therefore, we will continue to work to protect your personal information security, and implement security encryption and other safeguards throughout storage and transmission to prevent your information from being accessed, used or disclosed without authorization. At the same time, the specific content of some encrypted data is only accessible by the user.
(4) When we transmit and store your particular type of personal information, we use security measures such as encryption; when we store personal biometric information, technical measures will be used to process the information before it is stored. For example, only the summary of personal biometric information will be stored.
3. In the event of a personal information security incident, we will comply with the requirements of the laws and regulations, and will inform you in time of the basic situation and possible impact of the security incident, the disposal measures we have taken or will take, the suggestions you can take to prevent and reduce the risk, or the remedial measures. We will inform you of the event by mail, letter, telephone or notice. When it is difficult to inform the user of personal information one by one, we will issue the announcement in a reasonable and effective manner. At the same time, we will also actively report the handling of personal information security incidents in accordance with requirements of the regulatory authorities.
VII Your rights to your personal information

We may reject requests that are unwarranted, require excessive technical means (for example, to develop new systems or radically change existing practices), pose a risk to the legitimate rights and interests of others, or are highly unrealistic. In addition, if your request is directly related to national security, national defense security, public health, criminal investigation and other matters directly related to the public interest, or is likely to cause serious damage to the legitimate rights and interests of yours or other individuals or organizations, we may not be able to respond to your request.
