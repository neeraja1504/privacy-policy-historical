5. Managing Your Privacy.
As set forth herein above, Company and/or third-parties that either serve advertisements on our behalf and/or on behalf of others may use technology information to match your information to make and improve profiles of you, to track your online browsing habits over time and across different websites on the Internet and to show you targeted advertising for products and/or services.
Because an industry-standard Do-Not-Track protocol has not yet been established, Company's information collection practices will continue to operate as described in this Privacy Policy regardless of any “Do Not Track” signals that may be sent by certain browsers or selected by you. However, you can visit www.cookiecentral.com and www.aboutads.info to learn more about this type of advertising and how to opt-out from receiving it by from companies that participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) self-regulatory program. Opting-out, however, will not stop advertising from appearing on your browser. Rather, it may make the advertisements that you are presented with less relevant to your own personal interests.
We believe that you benefit from a more personalized experience when we know more about you and what you like. However, you can limit the information you provide to us and thereby limit the communications that we and/or third-parties send to you.
