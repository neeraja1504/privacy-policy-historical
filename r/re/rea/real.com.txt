WHAT INFORMATION MAY BE COLLECTED BY THIRD-PARTY COMPANIES?
When you visit our website or use our products or services, certain third-party companies can collect information as part of serving ads, providing analytics services, or delivering content or plug-ins.
We work with  third-party advertising companies to help ensure the advertisements about goods and services you see are likely to be of greater interest to you. These third party partners currently include Google’s DoubleClick. The advertising companies we work with typically use third-party cookies and/or web beacons to collect a unique ID number in combination with information such as click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over during your visits to this and other websites in order. In order to enable a consistent browsing experience, the RealPlayer PC application may copy the DoubleClick cookie from your web browser to the app’s embedded browser.
Please review our Use of Cookies section to understand how we Use cookies and how you can change cookie settings.
On mobile devices, these advertising companies sometimes collect and use this cookie along with advertising IDs provided by the mobile operating systems – such as the Android advertising ID and/or Apple's ID for advertising. These advertising IDs can be controlled or reset through your mobile operating system settings. Settings vary from device to device but you will usually find the ad identifier settings under "privacy" or "ads" in your device's settings.
To learn more about third-party targeted advertising, you can visit either the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) or the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), which each provide an easy way to opt out of ad targeting from participating companies.  Similarly, for Europe you can visit the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA) and for Canada you can visit Ad Choices: Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada (DAAC) / Choix de Pub: l'Alliance de la publicité numérique du Canada (DAAC).
We also use third-party analytics providers such as Google Analytics to help us compile aggregated statistics about the operation and effectiveness of our websites. Analytics providers set or read their own cookies or other identifiers on your device, through which they can collect information about your use of our websites and those of other companies.  You can learn more about Google Analytics, including how to opt-out, by visiting Google’s Privacy & Terms for Partners.
When you search for specific content on RealNetworks websites, the search terms may be embedded in the "search string" that appears in the URL display window of your web browser. Certain advertising services or third-party content providers may associate these search strings with cookies they set or retrieve from our pages.
USE OF COOKIES
Please see RealNetworks’ Cookie Policy for more information about how RealNetworks and our business partners use cookies and similar technologies.
WHEN AND HOW DO WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES?
We will not share your personal information with third parties without your consent, except as necessary for the purposes set forth in this Privacy Policy.
In some cases, access to certain products and services may require the provision of personal information to a third party. In such cases, this will be stated during the registration process, in the terms of use, through the distribution process, or in a similar manner. The third party's use of such information is governed by that party's privacy policy. Please visit the privacy policy of the third party to make sure you understand how they use the personal information you provide to them. If you do not wish for such a transfer to take place, you should not register for the applicable product or service. Additionally, RealNetworks may be required to provide specific access and usage information to certain content providers and rights holders as a condition of content licensing and royalties.
RealNetworks may disclose relevant information about our customers to our contractors in order for them to provide specific services for RealNetworks. For an example RealNetworks shares personal information with third party payment processors for billing purposes. RealNetworks contractors are bound to keep all personal information they process confidential.
RealNetworks may transfer personal information in connection with a sale, merger, transfer, exchange or other disposition (whether of assets, stock or otherwise) of all or a portion of a business of RealNetworks and/or its subsidiaries.
Finally, RealNetworks may disclose your personal information, including the content of files you upload using RealNetworks’ products or services, if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law; (b) comply with the order of a competent judicial authority in any jurisdiction; (c) comply with legal process served on RealNetworks; (d) protect and defend the rights or property of RealNetworks; or (e) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of RealNetworks products or the public at large.
RealNetworks websites may link to third-party websites or services.  Certain RealNetworks products allow the addition of third-party plug-ins.  This Privacy Policy does not apply to any such third-party websites, services, or plug-ins.
HOW TO MANAGE E-MAIL COMMUNICATIONS FROM REALNETWORKS
RealNetworks will send marketing e-mail messages to you only in accordance with your preferences. You may change your communications preferences at any time by either (a) selecting the opt-out option in any marketing message you receive or (b) if you have created an online account with RealNetworks, changing your account setting to select whether to receive marketing messages. Note that separate RealNetworks products, services and lines of business may send separate newsletters and marketing emails to you, which you may have to manage separately. We may also send you certain essential (non-promotional) e-mail about products or services you have previously purchased or to inform you about critical technical service issues relating to a RealNetworks product or service even if you have opted out of marketing messages.
HOW TO ACCESS AND UPDATE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
To access your account information and preferences, select "Manage My Account" from the menus in the RealPlayer (usually under the "Help" menu) or other RealNetworks consumer software. Sign in to your account and modify your information and preferences as needed.

TRANSFER OF DATA TO OTHER COUNTRIES
RealNetworks processes information about our users on servers located in a number of countries. We may also subcontract processing or share your information to third parties located in countries other than your home country. Information collected by RealNetworks in the United States may, for example, be transferred to and processed in a country outside of the United States. Information collected within the European Economic Area and Switzerland may, for example, be transferred to, and processed in a country outside of the European Economic Area and Switzerland, some of which have not been determined by the European Commission to have an adequate level of data protection. Wherever we process personal information, we do so according to the provisions of this Privacy Policy and the requirements of applicable law.
EU-U.S. AND SWISS-U.S. PRIVACY SHIELD
RealNetworks complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from the European Union and Switzerland, and has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. The subsidiaries of RealNetworks included in our Privacy Shield certification also adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles.  If there is any conflict between this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.
In some cases, RealNetworks may remain liable if a third party processes personal data on our behalf in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit www.privacyshield.gov.
If you have a question or complaint related to our participation in the Privacy Shield, we encourage you to contact us via our web form.
