You take your privacy seriously and so does Real Living Real Estate. We are a company committed to protecting the personal information and privacy of our customers. This statement is one way of sustaining your trust in our company, our products and our services.
Our Online Privacy Statement describes how we collect, protect and use information about you during your visit to our web sites.  Our web sites also contain hyperlinks to web sites operated by parties other than Real Living Real Estate, LLC or its affiliates.
These other parties include independently owned and operated Real Living franchise offices and their sales associates and service providers who have a relationship with us.  This privacy policy is applicable only when you are on our web sites.  Once linked to another party’s web site, you should read that site's privacy policy before disclosing any personal information.

We may collect and subsequently share personal information about you to:
run our everyday business;

We do not sell or rent personally identifiable information to third parties.  We may disclose personally identifiable information to our affiliates or to third parties only to the extent necessary to respond to a specific request made by you.  We also may disclose personally identifiable information as may be required by law.

This anonymous information is used for research and analytical purposes only (like evaluating how many visitors our Web sites receive or which pages they visit most often). It does not reveal any personal information about you, the user. This aggregate data may be disclosed to third parties, but never with personally identifying information.

The information helps us improve the functionality of the site and enhance the navigation and security of your session. Most major Web sites use this technology and most browsers are set up to accept them.
You may configure your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, and you may refuse to accept them entirely. However, if you refuse to accept cookies, you may limit the functionality that we can provide to you when you visit our site.
