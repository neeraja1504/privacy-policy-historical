With your consent: We will disclose your personal information if you have explicitly agreed that we may do so.
Users of our API: Readmill has an open API which enables application developers to integrate elements of the Platform into exciting new apps. Some of these developers may be locations outside of the European Economic Area. Any personal information that you choose to make public on the Platform, including our public profile information and any public readings, may be accessible to these developers. Please bear this in mind when deciding what information to publish on your profile.
Other networks and connected apps: If you choose to connect your Readmill account to other apps or social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Wordpress or Pinterest, you will be sharing certain information with these apps or networks.

Choice and Control
We do our best to give you as much choice as possible regarding the amount of personal information you provide to us, and the control you have over that information.
It is not necessary for you to provide us with any information in order to visit the Website, although certain information will be collected automatically by virtue of your visit (as described above). However, if you do decide to register a Readmill account, you can control your personal information in the following ways.
Email preferences
Check out the Basics tab within your Settings page on the Website. When you are logged in to your account, you can access your Settings by clicking on your profile picture at the top of the screen, and selecting Settings from the drop down menu.
From the Basics tab you can tell us:
The email address that you may wish us to use to communicate with you.
You can also turn off email notifications from the Notifications tab within your Settings. This will immediately disable all email notifications, other than essential account notifications such as important service updates, reports of copyright infringement and other essential information relating to your account and your use of the Platform.
It is also possible to unsubscribe from email newsletters and notifications (other than essential account notifications) at any time by clicking on the link at the end of each email.
Sharing with other apps and networks
The Connections tab within your Settings on the Website enables you to control the information you share with other networks and applications. As well as selecting those of your social networks you wish to share to, you can also control access to other services and applications to which you have connected your Readmill account.
If you sign up for Readmill using your Facebook account, your Readmill account and your Facebook account respectively will be connected automatically. Information regarding the public readings, comments and likes that you post on Readmill, will be shared with the connected Facebook account. If you do not want this information shared with Facebook please change your Settings.
Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any third party sites or applications, and we cannot control the activities of those sites or applications. You are advised to read the privacy policies of those sites or applications before sharing your information with, or connecting your Readmill account to, any of these third party sites or applications.
Sharing with other users
Readmill is a very social place, but if you would prefer to read anonymously you may do so anytime in the app. By doing so, other users will not be able to see your readings, but we will still have access to this information.
Sharing with app developers
Readmill has an open API, which allows third party developers to build some really cool apps as an extension of the Platform. Please note that your public profile information will be accessible, but this does not include anything that this not publicly available on the Website.
Deleting your account
You can delete your account from the Basics page within your Settings on the Website at any time. Please bear in mind that, if you delete your account, all data associated with your account, including the content shared and the usage data associated with that content, will be deleted and may not be recoverable. You are therefore advised to copy or back up all content uploaded to your account before you delete your account.
Even if you delete your Readmill account, it is possible that your information may still show up in some internet search results for a short while afterwards, if the search engine maintains a temporary cache of web pages. Search engines' caching processes are outside of Readmill’s control and therefore we cannot be responsible for any information that remains cached by search engines after that information has been removed from the Platform.
Please note that deleting any Readmill Apps, or any third party apps to which your Readmill account is connected, will not delete your Readmill account. If you wish to delete your account, you will need to do so from the Basics tab in your Settings on the Website. Similarly, if you delete a third party app that is connected to your Readmill account over our API, this will not necessarily delete all data from within that third party app. You will need to refer to the app provider’s terms of use and privacy policy to find out how to delete your data from that third party app.
Access to your data
As described above, most of the personal information you provide to us can be accessed and updated in the Settings page of your Readmill account. If you wish to access, amend or delete any other personal information we hold about you, or if you have any objection to the processing of any information that we hold about you, please contact us at support@readmill.com
If you ask us to delete your account (either via the Settings page or by email), we will do so within a reasonable period of time, but we may need to retain some of your personal information in order to satisfy our legal obligations, or where we have a legitimate reason for doing so.
International data transfers
Readmill is based in Europe, and your personal information is collected, stored, used and shared in accordance with European laws. However, from time to time, it may be necessary for us to transfer your personal data to the United States to (1) maintain a high level of service through companies like New Relic, (2) provide useful information to you relating to the app and website through services like Campaign Monitor and (3) to consistently improve the services and product we offer and you expressly consent to such transfers. You should be aware that privacy laws in the United States may not be equivalent to the laws in your country, and by using the Platform, you consent to the transfer, storage and processing of your personal information in the United States in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law. In relation to such personal data, we shall take all reasonably necessary steps to ensure that it is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Declaration of Consent
I hereby give permission for my personal data to be transferred to third parties as set forth under this Section for the purpose of conducting the services provided by Readmill. I reserve the right to withdraw this consent by notifying Readmill in writing or by e-mail (support@readmill.com), in which case Readmill will be obligated to delete my personal data from their and the third party’s server within a reasonable period of time.
Social Plugins
Our website uses the following social plugins (“Plugins”):
Plugin provided by the social network facebook.com, operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Avenue, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA (“Facebook”). The Plugin is identifiable by a Facebook logo.
Plugin by the Twitter service, operated by Twitter Inc., 795 Folsom St., Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA (“Twitter”). The button can be recognized via the “Twitter” or “Follow” sign.
The content of the Plugin button is sent directly from the relevant company (e.g. Facebook) to your browser and integrated via the browser into the webpage. This may have the effect of establishing a direct connection between your browser and the servers of the respective companies (e.g. Facebook) as soon as you visit a page of our website that contains the Plugin. Further or more intensive interaction usually occurs when you press the relevant buttons (e.g. by clicking “Like” in case of Facebook), especially if you are simultaneously logged onto the services of the respective companies. Our own website can therefore not influence which data is collected through the operation of the Plugins.
For further information on the collection and processing and use of Personal Data by the respective companies, please visit their websites and view their privacy policies.
Children
Readmill is not intended for use by children. Anyone under the age of 13 is not permitted to use the Platform and must not attempt to register an account or submit any personal information to us. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from any person who is under the age of 13 or allow them to register an account. If it comes to our attention that we have collected personal data from a person under the age of 13, we will delete this information as quickly as possible. If you have reason to believe that we may have collected any such data, please notify us immediately at support@readmill.com
Access to Information
Under EU data protection legislation, you have the right to access information held about you. Your right of access can be exercised in accordance with the legislation. Any access request may be subject to a fee of 10 EUR to meet our costs in providing you with details of the information we hold about you.
Changes and Updates to this Privacy Policy
We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy, and when we do so, we will also revise the Effective Date set out below. Any changes to our Privacy Policy will always be available here so that Readmill users are always aware of what information we gather, and how we might use and share that information.
