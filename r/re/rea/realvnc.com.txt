Your information is only collected or handled if you have signed in to VNC® Viewer with your RealVNC® account, or if you have allowed the collection of usage data.
When you use your RealVNC®  account to sign in to VNC® Viewer, we collect and handle information about your sign-in so you can identify exactly where you’ve signed in from. The details we collect include application name and version, local user name, computer description, machine name, device name, device type, and OS name and version. This information is cleared if you sign out of VNC® Viewer.
When signed in to a VNC® Viewer with your RealVNC® account , we also collect information about computers in your VNC® Viewer Address Book. The details include any name you have assigned to a computer in your address book, the address to use when connecting to it (e.g. a hostname, IP address, port/display details, or other identifier), the public key to expect when connecting to that computer, the default user name to use for authentication, the time of last connection, any configured labels for the address book entry, and an optional screenshot taken during the last connection. You can clear this information at any time by deleting the relevant address book entries from VNC® Viewer.
When you use VNC® Viewer’s Instant Support capability,  we collect chat transcripts logging information about activities in the session. Logging information includes the timings and results of activities such as session start/end, file transfer, elevation requests and reboot attempts. This information allows us to provide you with historic details of instant support sessions you have been involved in. All chat transcripts are encrypted at-rest on our servers.
We need to collect and handle your personal information in these ways to perform the contract for your use of our software.
When you use the Instant Support Application, or when you receive support from someone using VNC® Connect’s Instant Support capability, you download and run the Instant Support Application. During the support session, we collect chat transcripts logging information about activities in the session. Logging information includes your IP address and the timings and results of activities such as session start/end, file transfer, elevation requests and reboot attempts.
We need to collect and handle your personal information in these ways to perform our contract for the use of this software.
When you use our VNC® Server and VNC® Viewer applications , if the ‘send usage data’ option is enabled, we will use our own systems as well as selected third-party analytics providers to collect and process the following information:
Device/machine information, such as machine name, network name, brand, manufacturer, model, operating system version and IP address.
Version, mode and subscription information.
Information about paths through the software.
Frequency that features are used, and how they are used.
Summary information about remote control sessions established, including (but not limited to) encryption type, protocol version, preferences set, duration and locale.
For the avoidance of doubt, we explicitly do not log or collect passwords, mouse clicks or keystrokes. These are encrypted end-to-end and are never available either to RealVNC® or to third parties.
This data may be used for product improvement, to tune the system, support technical decision-making, inform choices for a better user experience, and to validate and improve our model of user behaviour.
The collection of this data can be prevented by disabling the ‘send usage data’ option in the VNC® Server and VNC® Viewer applications.
