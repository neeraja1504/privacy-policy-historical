If you request that we delete your account on any of our Services (via a user settings page, by email, or otherwise), we will do so within a reasonable period of time, but we may need to retain some of your information in order to satisfy our legal obligations, or where we reasonably believe that we have a legitimate reason to do so.

We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies applicable to any Web site or service you visit other than the Services before providing any Personal Information on them.
INTERNATIONAL VISITORS
RealScout is based in the United States and our servers and data centers are primarily located in the United States. If you choose to use the Services from outside the U.S., then you should know that you are transferring your Personal Information outside of your region and into the U.S. for storage and processing. By providing your information to us through your use of the Services, you consent to the transfer, storage, and processing of such information in the U.S. and other countries. Also, we may transfer your data from the U.S. to other countries or regions in connection with storage and processing of data, fulfilling your requests, and operating the Services. You should know that each region can have its own privacy and data security laws, some of which may be less stringent as compared to those of your own region.
SECURITY
We use reasonable security measures that are designed to protect personal information from accidental loss, disclosure, misuse, and destruction. Please be aware, however, that no data security measures can be guaranteed to be completely effective. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you provide to us. You transmit information to us at your own risk.
UPDATES TO THIS POLICY
We may occasionally update this Policy. When we do, we will also revise the “last updated” date at the beginning of the Policy. Your continued use of our Services after such changes will be subject to the then-current policy. If we change this Policy in a manner that is materially less restrictive of our use or disclosure of your information, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you of the change (such as adding a statement to our homepage, sending you an email or such other method as we determine) and to obtain your consent prior to applying the change to any information that we collected from you prior to the date the change becomes effective.
