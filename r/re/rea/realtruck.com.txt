Ways We Collect your Information:
We collect your information at registration and during the ordering process. Before checking out and even while placing some items in your shopping cart, RealTruck will require you to enter vehicle information as well as an online registration form. During registration, you will be asked to give us your personal information including your name, shipping and billing address, phone number, payment information (credit card number), and email address.
Additional information required may be your country of residence and your organization's country of operation so that we can adhere to applicable laws and regulations.

If you are using the PayPal Credit method of payment, formerly known as Bill Me Later, the last four (4) digits of your social security number and your date of birth are required. This information is used only for the PayPal Credit transaction. It will not be kept in our files.
A few locations on the RealTruck.com website permit you to enter your email address for marketing and communication purposes. These are either to register for a contest or sweepstakes, or to sign up for email newsletters and special offers. Participation in a contest or sweepstakes is completely voluntary. RealTruck will use information to notify contest and sweepstakes winners and to award prizes. We may post on our website the names, photos, videos, cities, and states of contest and sweepstakes winners when applicable. By entering a contest or sweepstakes, you may be opting in to receive our email newsletter and special offers, and this will be disclosed in the official rules governing the contest or sweepstakes. Contest and sweepstakes rules and regulations are outlined per event.

Your Privacy Protection:
RealTruck takes great steps to ensure that your data is collected safely, efficiently, and is protected at all times. We employ several internal and external methods of high security to ensure your personal and financial data is safe from potential fraud.
RealTruck.com is a verified PayPal Payments Pro merchant. Our website is not only protected by secure-transaction technology through PayPal, but we've also taken steps to ensure our environment for collecting your data meets or exceeds their standards for doing business. PayPal is a worldwide leader in the e-commerce industry and has been for over a decade, so you can shop with confidence knowing your credit information is locked down.
In addition to the merchant provided security, RealTruck has added GeoTrust Secure Socket Layer technology to our website. This certificate once again enables us to do business securely and efficiently without fear of transmitting any personal or sensitive data unwittingly to the wrong recipient.
Finally, trust our website's content, images, videos, and more with our daily Qualys Secure scanning technology. Rest assured you'll receive no viruses or other bots from our site due to our ever-diligent protective online software. With over 500,000 products online with photos and more, Qualys provides us with the protection needed to keep your computer and our servers safe.
Additional Privacy Considerations:
We do not knowingly or intentionally collect personal information from children under age 18. If you are under the age of 18, please do not submit any personal information to us, and instead rely on a parent or guardian to assist you.
You may choose to submit a product review, video and/or photograph of your vehicle or accessory to RealTruck.com. If you post a review, we may ask for your email address and geographic location. If you submit a review, your geographic location will be visible to other users (your email address will be kept private). Also, any personally identifiable information that you submit as part of the review can be read or used by other visitors to RealTruck.com. We are not responsible for any personally identifiable information that you choose to submit as part of your review.
We use your information internally to complete your order, process it, and provide you with any additional customer service you may need. Due to the method of our business, your order and shipping information is shared with any manufacturer that you may have selected to purchase from to ensure you receive your product in a timely manner. Our agreement with our manufacturer / vendors and brands ensures that your information is not "sold" or used by these third parties in any way outside of fulfilling your order and providing warranty, returns, or any other applicable customer service needed.
RealTruck does not sell, rent, license, or disclose any of your personal or financial information to anyone other than to our RealTruck.com affiliates. Our disclosure to our affiliates is solely to perform the function of processing your order, servicing a warranty, or providing customer service. It's our promise to you that we will protect your data and your privacy.
Sometimes RealTruck, Inc. hires third parties to perform marketing and other functions on our behalf. We partner with these companies to improve the quality of our service and to give you, our customer, the best experience possible while shopping with us.
In the event of a request from law enforcement to disclose personal, financial, and order information, RealTruck, Inc. will comply with all investigations. RealTruck, Inc. requires that proper subpoenas and court orders are provided to disclose any information. We will also release any necessary information when disclosure is needed to protect our legal rights, to enforce our Terms of Use, or other agreements.
Upon your request, we will stop sending you emails, disable your account for any purchases, or update any customer information you require. Please visit our Customer Service page or give us a call.
