RealtyTrac Community Content. The RealtyTrac Community portion of the RealtyTrac.com website contains sections (aka forums or message boards) where readers and users can submit and publish comments, questions, and answers. We do not actively monitor these sections, and RealtyTrac, its affiliates, and content licensors assume no liability for any content therein, or for any actions taken in reliance thereon. If we are alerted to something we deem inappropriate in any way, we may delete it at our discretion. We use login validation for most of our Community in order to reduce "comment spam." While your email address will not be published, the actual content of the any comments, questions, and answers you submit are considered public property. Do not offer any personal information in any content you submit, unless you want that information displayed publically to the online world. We will remove "comment spam" from our Community sections at our discretion.
You may contact our customer service department to update or correct your personal information at anytime. If you wish to opt out of receiving further communication from us regarding future promotions or other goods and services, please contact our customer service department. Please know that depending on what opt-out choices you select, your ability to maintain your membership and continue to obtain goods and services may be affected. Our customer service department can be reached by e-mail at support@realtytrac.com; by telephone at 877.888.8722; and by facsimile transmission at 949.305.0803. The effective date of any opt-out action will be ten (10) business days following the date your opt-out request is received by RealtyTrac, after which your e-mail address will be added to the suppression files associated with this site.
If you want to request to be removed from further communication with this site, including our Premium Services, please opt out by clicking on this link to our opt-out procedure. We will place your e-mail address on a suppression file associated with this site. Persons whose names appear on our suppression file will have their e-mail addresses checked against all correspondence to be sent by us. Where there is a match, the planned e-mail correspondence will be withheld, and such persons will receive no further e-mail correspondence from us. Your e-mail address will be placed on the suppression list associated with this site following ten (10) business days of the day your opt-out request is received by RealtyTrac.
We may unilaterally amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting a new privacy policy on the site. Be sure to check the current terms of any privacy policy in effect by visiting this site. By checking the effective date of the policy, you will know whether the Privacy Policy has been amended. Please note however, that all amended terms, or the new privacy policy shall automatically become effective thirty (30) days after initial posting.
If you choose not to accept or do not agree to be bound by the terms of the revised or amended Privacy Policy, then you must opt out and terminate your RealtyTrac Membership before the effective date of the revised or amended Privacy Policy. Your failure to take advantage of the opt-out provisions prior to the effective date of the revised or amended Privacy Policy will constitute your agreement and approval to be bound by the revised or amended Privacy Policy after its effective date.
From time to time, we may use your information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our Privacy Policy. Please note that if our information practices change at some time in the future, we will use only data collected from the time of the new policy amendment forward for those new purposes.
