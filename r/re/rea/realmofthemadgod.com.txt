Cookies
What are cookies?
We may collect information using “cookies”. Cookies are small data files stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer or mobile device until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Sites.
We use two broad categories of cookies: (1) first party cookies, served directly by us to your computer or mobile device, which are used only by us to recognize your computer or mobile device when it revisits our Sites; and (2) third party cookies, which are served by service providers on our Sites, and can be used by such service providers to recognize your computer or mobile device when it visits other websites.

Our Sites use the following types of cookies for the purposes set out below:

Purpose
---|---
Analytics and Performance Cookies
|
These cookies are used to collect information about traffic to our Sites and how users use our Sites and Services. The information gathered does not identify any individual visitor. The information is aggregated and therefore anonymous. It includes the number of visitors to our Sites, the websites that referred them to our Sites, the pages that they visited on our Sites, what time of day they visited our Sites, whether they have visited our Sites before, and other similar information. We use this information to help operate our Sites and Services more efficiently, to gather broad demographic information and to monitor the level of activity on our Sites.
We use Google Analytics for this purpose. Google Analytics uses its own cookies. We use this information to improve how our Sites and Services work. You can find out more information about Google Analytics cookies here:https://developers.google.com/analytics/resources/concepts/gaConceptsCookies and how Google uses your data here: https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/****

We may also use Flash cookies (which are also known as Flash LSOs) on our Sites to collect and store information about your use of our Sites and Services. Unlike other cookies, Flash cookies cannot be removed or rejected via your browser settings. If you do not want Flash cookies stored on your computer or mobile device, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash LSO storage using the tools contained in the Website Storage Settings Panel at https://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html.

Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash LSOs may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in connection with our Sites and Services.
Pixel Tags
We may also use pixel tags (which are also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) on our Sites to track the actions of users on our Sites. Unlike cookies, which are stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website, pixel tags are embedded invisibly on WebPages. Pixel tags measure the success of our marketing campaigns and compile statistics about usage of the Sites, so that we can manage our content more effectively. The information we collect using pixel tags is not linked to our users’ personal data.

We may share your personal data as follows:
Third Parties Designated by You: We may share your personal data with third parties where you have provided your consent to do so
Our Third Party Service Providers: We may share your personal data with our third party service providers who provide services such as data analysis, payment processing, information technology and related infrastructure provision, customer service, email delivery, auditing and other similar services.

When we use the term “anonymous data”, we are referring to data and information that does not permit you to be identified or identifiable, either alone or when combined with any other information available to a third party.
We may create anonymous data from the personal data we receive about you and other individuals whose personal data we collect.

We reserve the right to use anonymous data for any purpose and to disclose anonymous data to third parties in our sole discretion.
Third Party Sites
Our Sites may contain links to third party websites and features. This Policy does not cover the privacy practices of such third parties.

Please read their privacy policies before you submit any data to them.
User Generated Content
You may share personal data with us when you submit user generated content to our Sites, including on forums and blogs on our Sites.

We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Security
We seek to use reasonable organizational, technical and administrative measures to protect personal data within our organization. Unfortunately, no transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be completely secure, and transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure.

You may access the personal data we hold about you. If you wish to exercise this right, please contact us using the details in the Contact Information section below. Any access request may be subject to a fee to meet our costs in providing you with details of the information we hold about you.

For your protection, we may only implement requests with respect to the personal data associated with the particular email address that you use to send us your request, and we may need to verify your identity before implementing your request. We will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable.
Please note that we may need to retain certain information for recordkeeping purposes and/or to complete any transactions that you began prior to requesting such change or deletion (e.g., when you enter a promotion, you may not be able to change or delete the personal data provided until after the completion of such promotion).
