Information that may be collected
Analytics and logs
realityblurred.com uses Google Analytics to track usage of the website and information about visitors, such as pages that were visited or what web browsers people are using to visit the site. Any data that’s gathered will not be linked to any information that is personally identifiable, and your IP address will be anonymized by Google Analytics.
In order to ensure network and information security and prevent fraud, the web servers that host realityblurred.com may generate and store access, usage, and/or error logs, which may include IP addresses of visitors to the site. Only authorized personnel have access to those sever logs, and they are automatically deleted after seven days.
Cookies
Cookies may be set in your browser when you visit this website, including by third-party services and as described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, in order to support advertising, social sharing, and other functions.
You can, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies by changing the settings in your web browser, including by permanently denying the setting of cookies. Furthermore, you may delete already set cookies at any time via your browser or other software programs.
Embedded content from other websites
Articles on this site may include embedded content, such as YouTube or Facebook videos; tweets from Twitter; or comments from Spot.IM. Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as you’ve visited that website.
Those websites may collect data about you, use cookies to provide their content, embed additional third-party tracking, and/or monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracing your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.

realityblurred.com uses Google Surveys, which asks you a few market research questions in order to give you free access to premium content and to provide realityblurred.com with revenue. Answers are anonymous and not connected to personally identifiable information, nor are they used to show ads to you. realityblurred.com does not have access to your answers nor know what you’ve been asked; all answers are aggregated with other anonymous answers before being provided to the company or person who paid for the survey. You may choose “Show me a different question” or “Skip survey” if you are uncomfortable with the questions. The “Info” link at the bottom of the survey has details about how the surveys work.
As a result of your visit to realityblurred.com, third-party ad server and traffic monitoring companies—including advertising networks and exchanges, traffic measurement service providers, marketing-analytics service providers, and others—may collect anonymous data. In addition, third-party advertising companies may use non-personally identifiable information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide relevant ads. Other technologies, such as cookies, JavaScript, or web beacons, may also be used by the third-party ad networks to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and/or to personalize the advertising content that you see.
Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on realityblurred.com. Google’s use of the DoubleClick cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads to users based on their visit to realityblurred.com and other sites on the Internet.
realityblurred.com itself has no access to or control over these cookies that are used by third-party advertisers. realityblurred.com’s privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites.
