In addition to the above, we may need to share your information in continuance of the transaction for which you have voluntarily utilized our services. The ways in which we share that information immediately follows.
Potential Disclosure of Subscriber Information to Related Transaction Parties; Ongoing Compliance with Governmental Requirements. The real estate company(ies) sponsoring an investment project (collectively, the “Sponsor”), lenders relating to the investment project, or other parties involved with the investment and related transactions (collectively, “Related Transaction Parties”) may require that RealtyShares, the Manager, or any of their respective affiliates provide such Related Transaction Parties with the names, investment amounts, and other information regarding the various investors in a financing offering, notwithstanding the usual privacy policies of RealtyShares or any of its affiliates. You hereby expressly consent and agree that any of RealtyShares, the Manager or any of their respective affiliates may provide such information (which may include, without limitation, Social Security numbers or similar identifying information, evidence of your qualification as an “accredited investor,” or other information related to your involvement with an investment project) to any such Related Transaction Parties requiring such information as part of the consummation of, or continued participation in, the investment project or the related transactions contemplated hereunder, as RealtyShares or any of its affiliates may deem appropriate in its or their sole and absolute discretion.
The Department of the Treasury, the Internal Revenue Service, and other governmental authorities may from time to time impose certain compliance or reporting requirements that may require RealtyShares or any of its affiliates to request from you additional financial or personal information. These regulations, including (without limitation), the PATRIOT Act and the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, may require increased due diligence, compliance activity, or reporting on the part of RealtyShares or any of its affiliates. You hereby warrants that you will, upon request, supply to RealtyShares or any of its affiliates all information reasonably necessary or advisable to carry out such functions or requirements.
Safeguarding User Information
The Security of your User Information is important to us, and we take commercially reasonable steps to safeguard such information. These steps and procedural safeguards are in line with industry standards and practices and include:
(i) Encryption and authentication tools to maintain the confidentiality of User Information including Transport Layer Security technology (TLS) encryption certificates provided by Comodo CA Limited (SHA-256 With RSA Encryption);
(ii) Limits on, to the greatest extent possible, who or what can access your User Information, including utilization of a “lease-privilege principle” such that employees have access only to the information and systems needed to perform their functions and only for the duration of such need;
(iii) Redundant systems to monitor the entire RealtyShares’ server infrastructure in real-time with web-based and server applications reporting and instant notification to the appropriate staff for any remediation; and
(iv) The use of cookies to help (anonymously) recognize you as a repeat visitor and to track Site traffic patterns.
However, despite these efforts, please note that RealtyShares cannot ensure or guarantee the security of your User Information nor do we make any representation or warranty regarding the security of your account. If we learn of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. We may also post a notice on or through the Site and the Services in the event of a security breach. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.
Accurate Information
You are solely responsible for helping us to maintain the accuracy and completeness of your personal and other information. We urge you to review your information regularly to ensure that it is correct and complete. If you believe that any of your information is incorrect, please contact us at contact@realtyshares.com.
You may, of course, decline to share any or all of your Personal Information with us or ask us to delete your Personal Information from our systems at any time, in which case we may not be able to provide to you some of the features and functionality found on or through the Site and the Services ( see below section regarding Right To Opt-out).
Additional Accreditation Verification Measures. In addition to the information you provide to us, under certain circumstances, federal law may require RealtyShares or any of its affiliates to take additional steps to verify that you are an “accredited investor.” If such circumstances apply to the offering of certain securities in which you would like to invest, you agree to utilize an independent third-party verification provider, which may be VerifyInvestor.com (“VI”) or such other service provider as RealtyShares may from time to time utilize for such purpose, to verify your status as an accredited investor. You understand that VI or such other provider may contact you directly in such instance, and you agree to promptly work with VI or such other provider to complete the verification process. RealtyShares or an affiliate will pay the service provider's fees and costs for this service. RealtyShares will not share with you the information received from VI or such other service provider regarding you or your status as an accredited investor unless such information is the basis for RealtyShares or an affiliate declining to accept your investment subscription.
We will retain your User Information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services, and we may continue to retain such User Information beyond your active use of the RealtyShares platform. You may modify or delete the Personal Information you have provided to us by logging in and updating your account. We may, however, retain certain information as required by law or for necessary business purposes.
