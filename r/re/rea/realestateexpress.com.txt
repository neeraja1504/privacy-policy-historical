Privacy Policy - Real Estate Express
Information sharing
Legal disclaimer
Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law or where we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Website.
Third party intermediaries/service providers
We use a credit card processing company to bill users for the Services, including Real Estate Express education courses. We share users’ personal information with this third party company only to the extent necessary to process payment for the Services.
Information confirming users’ completion of Real Estate Express courses is sent to the following states if the users reside in those states: Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Virginia and Washington. This information is shared with the applicable state to provide the user credit with the relevant state licensing agency.
In compliance with FERPA regulation 99.3, directory information (name, email address, phone number, registration date) may be shared with Partner Affiliate Members when a student enrolls through a Partner Affiliate’s website or uses a Partner Affiliate promotional code. For more information regarding our Partner Affiliate Member program, please click here.
We may also disclose users’ personal information to third party service providers who provide services to us, such as data analysis, information technology, customer service, email delivery, auditing or consulting services, and other similar services.
Business transitions
In the event Real Estate Express goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings), users’ personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred.
Communications from the site
Service announcements
On rare occasions we will send a strictly service-related announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their Real Estate Express account. These communications are not promotional in nature.
Special offers and updates
We send all new users a welcoming email to verify password and username. Established users may occasionally receive emails on products, services, and special deals.
Choice/opt-out
Users who no longer wish to receive our promotional communications may opt-out of receiving these communications by clicking on an opt-out link in all promotional emails. Users may also unsubscribe from these emails, and/or be removed from our database completely, by sending us an email at the address provided above, by sending a postal mail at the address provided above, or by calling us at the telephone number provided above.
Links
This Website contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, Real Estate Express, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our Website and to read the privacy statements of each and every site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Website.
Refer a friend
If a user takes advantage of our referral program to inform a friend about our Website, we ask for the friend’s name and email address. Real Estate Express will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the Website. Real Estate Express stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program. The friend may contact Real Estate Express via email at the address provided above, by sending us postal mail at the address provided above, or by calling us at the telephone number provided above to request the removal of this information from our database.
Message boards and public forums
Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online – for example on message boards or through email – that information can be collected and used by others. By posting personal information online that is publicly accessible, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.
Security
This Website takes every precaution to protect our users’ personal information. When users submit sensitive information via the Website or Services, we take every reasonable effort to protect their information both online and offline.
When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and transmitted via a secure server. Our secure socket layer (SSL) software is the industry standard and among the best software available today for secure commerce transactions. It encrypts all personal information including credit card number, name and address, so that it cannot be read as the information travels over the Internet.
Real Estate Express also does everything in its power to protect user information offline. All of our users’ information – not just the sensitive information mentioned above – is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, a billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. On at least an annual basis, and any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure that our users’ information is protected.
Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment.
If you have questions about information security at RealEstateExpress.com, please send an email to customercare@realestateexpress.com.
Access to personal information
Upon request we provide users with access to information that we obtain about them including financial information (e.g., credit card account information), unique identifier information (e.g., customer number or password), transaction information (e.g., dates on which customers made purchases, amounts and types of purchases), and contact information (e.g., name, address, phone number). Users can access this information by sending an email to the above address, calling us at the above telephone number, or by writing to us at the above address. Upon request we offer users the ability to have inaccuracies corrected in contact information, financial information, unique identifiers and transaction information. Users can have this information corrected by sending us email at the above address, calling us at the above telephone number, writing to us at the above address.

Notification of changes
We may change this Privacy Policy at any time in our sole discretion. If our information practices change at any time, Real Estate Express will contact users whose personal information we maintain, before we use such data for any new purposes. All such users will be notified of the policy change and provided a clear and convenient opportunity to opt out of the new practices. The personal information of users who do not opt out of the new practices will be subject to the new practices. If users have opted out of all communication with the Website, they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner.
Users may also prevent their information from being used for purposes other than those for which it was originally collected by sending a postal mail to the address provided above, or by calling us at the telephone number provided above.
