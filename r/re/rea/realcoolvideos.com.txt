III.            Information We Collect and How We Collect It
A. We collect information generally in one of three following ways: (i) we collect information you submit via the Service; (ii) we collect information we derive from your use of the Service; and (iii) we collect information we obtain from third parties. The information we gather enables us to personalize, improve, monetize and continue to operate the Service.
B. In connection with certain features of the Service, we may collect several types of information from and about you, including:
information that, taken alone, identifies you and that can be used to contact you, on-line or offline (“Personally Identifiable Information”), which may include, for example: your name, physical address, email address, gender, telephone number, date of birth or age range;
information about you that cannot be used, alone, to identify you; and
information about your use of the Service, which may include, for example, internet connection, your computer or mobile device and software you use to access the Service, including your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address or other device identifiers.
C Below are specific types of information we collect from our users:
1. Account Information. Certain features of the Service may require you to create a user account (an “Account”). If you create an Account with us, you will be asked to provide information that could be Personally Identifiable Information, such as your name, username, password, postal address and email address. You acknowledge that this information may be personal to you, and by creating an Account on the Service and providing Personally Identifiable Information to us, you allow others, including us, to identify you, and therefore, you may not be anonymous.
2. Information from Social Networking Websites.
A. By registering for an Account, you may have the option to sign in using third party social networking websites (“Social Networks”), such as Facebook or Twitter. You may also have the option of connecting to Social Networks to complete your profile information and populate your Account with information from these networks. If you choose to sign in through these Social Networks or connect your Account to these Social Networks, we use the information you have already provided to such Social Networks in registering for an account with such Social Networks and which you have allowed such Social Networks to share with WNI, including, but not limited to, your first name, your user profile picture, your friends and contacts list, your gender, and the networks to which you belong (collectively, your “Submitted Information”).
B. You expressly authorize us to collect and use your Submitted Information in connection with your use of the Service. You further acknowledge and agree that WNI may, but is not obligated to, maintain copies of your Submitted Information indefinitely, or delete any or all Submitted Information, at our sole discretion.
C. We advise you to carefully read to the terms of use and privacy policies of Social Networks. It is your responsibility to read and accept the respective Social Networks policies prior to signing into your Account through such Social Network.
3. Content
a. Among other features, the Service (including via whipclip.com and the Whipclip App) will allow you to (i) create, reproduce, display, perform and distribute (including by means of streaming or other digital transmission) bookmarked excerpts of certain third party streamed and on-demand audio and video content generated through use of the Service or third party websites or services (“Whip Clips”), (ii) provide comments with respect to Whip Clips, (iii) share links of Whip Clips through the Service, Social Networks and search engines, and (iv) follow other users who have created Whip Clips.
b. Some features of the Service, including, but not limited to, your creation, use, viewing, and sharing of Whip Clips, allow you to submit content to the Service, which may include videos, audio, images, graphics, written posts and comments and other forms of multimedia (collectively, “User Content”). All User Content submitted by you may be retained by us indefinitely, even after you terminate your Account. We may continue to disclose such User Content to third parties in a manner that does not reveal Personally Identifiable Information, as described in this Privacy Policy. By submitting any User Content, you agree that such User Content is non-confidential for all purposes. In addition, you User Content is posted and transmitted at your own risk. Additionally, we cannot control the actions of other users of the Service with whom you may choose to share User Content. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that your User Content will not be viewed by unauthorized persons.
4. IP Address Information and Other Information Collected Automatically.
a. We may collect IP addresses from you when you use the Service, and we may collect and monitor other data and information about your activities on the Service. We only use such data anonymously and in the aggregate. This data is not used to track or monitor Personally Identifiable Information of individual users. We gather and monitor this data to analyze trends, administer the Service, identify users when they visit or use the Service, track users’ movements when using of the Service, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We also may use the IP addresses to geo-target advertisements. We may share this information with our partners so that they too may understand our user base and Service usage patterns, but only on a collective, aggregated basis and in a manner which does not reveal any Personally Identifiable Information about any individual User.
b. We may use spot light ads/web beacons/GIF and/or pixel tags which are site instrumentation tools that help us to determine, for instance, whether a page has been viewed or not and, if so, how many times. When you ask us to send you information on a promotion or a newsletter, we may use web beacons to establish how many of the emails are actually opened. In general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page, including an ad banner, can act as a web beacon. We may use web beacons to collect web usage analytics.
c. When you visit portions of the Server, the server housing the applicable pages automatically generates a “session log.” We use session logs to help us determine how people travel through the Service. In this way, we can structure our pages so that the information most frequently visited is easier to find. By tracking page visits, we can also determine if the information we’re providing is being used. The only data gathered is the Internet Protocol (IP) address from which you came (which contains no personal information), the web site that referred you, the pages you visited and the date and time of those visits.
d. Users may be directed to the Service via banner ads or site links. Ads or website links that are placed by the Service may use cookies or web beacons to deliver metrics on the effectiveness of the ads or links. They do not collect Personally Identifiable Information from the user.
e. We or our vendors or content partners use several common online tracking tools, including browser and flash cookies, web beacons and similar technologies, to personal your experience on the Service, provide measurement services, and serve you targeted advertisements. Some web browsers have a “Do Not Track” feature that lets the browser specify that a user does not want to have their online activities tracked. These browser features are not uniform, and the Service does not respond to those “Do Not Track” signals.
f.  Information Collected using Cookies. Cookies, which are small text files recorded in a user’s hard drive, are employed by thousands of sites to enhance users’ web viewing. Cookies cannot damage user files, nor can they read information from a user’s hard drive. Cookies allow sites and advertisers to “remember” users across pages of a site and across multiple visits to a site. Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user’s computer. We use session and persistent cookies for remembering user preferences and current session information. Because of our use of cookies, we can deliver faster service, more consistent, updated results, and a more personalized site.
g.  Information Related to Advertising. To support and enhance the Service, we may serve, and also allow third party, advertisements (including, without limitation, pre-and post-roll, banner, frame and pop-up advertisements) through the Service. These advertisements are sometimes targeted and served to particular users and may come from third party companies called “ad networks.” Ad networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms. Advertisements served through the Service may be targeted to users who fit a certain general profile category and may be based on (i) anonymized information inferred from information provided to us by a user, including Personally Identifiable Information, (ii) Service usage patterns of particular users, (iii) the content in the Whip Clips you create or share or (iv) your activity on a Third Party Website. We do not provide Personally Identifiable Information to any ad networks for use outside of the Service.

A. A California resident who has provided personal information to a business with whom he/she has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes (“California customer”) is entitled to request information about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. In general, if the business has made such a disclosure of personal information, upon receipt of a request by a California customer, the business is required to provide a list of all third parties to whom personal information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of personal information that were disclosed.
B. However, under the law, a business is not required to provide the above-described lists if the business adopts and discloses to the public (in its privacy policy) a policy of not disclosing customer’s personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, as long as the business maintains and discloses this policy. Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of personal information and providing a cost free means to exercise that right.
