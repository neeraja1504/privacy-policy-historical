Your non-personally identifying demographic information is used to personalize your experience, allow other members to find you through a search, to compose your personal profile - which is associated with a pseudonymous identity you have created (username). Your contact information are available to other members only if you pre-set this options, otherwise our default setting will allow other users to see your contact information only, without demographic characteristics. Non-registered users (visitors) are not able to see your contact information or to contact you through Private Messaging system until they subscribe and become a valid REALPOOR.COM community member. In the event that you decide to buy one of our products or services, you will be asked for your financial information (like credit card number) which cannot be read by others when you initiate your order through a secured system. You will know you are in secure mode when the tiny padlock icon - located at the bottom of your browser - appears "locked". We are using CLICKBANK & PAYPAL for billing purposes. They pledge that the information you enter will not be shared with any outside party without your expressed consent (does not include fraud cases) and that any emails you receive from them will be related to your order. However, either CLICKBANK or PAYPAL are not the owner for this services, it's just a partner and billing processor.

The specific information we collect is not shared with other organizations and we will never release your personally identifiable information to an external organization without your prior consent except for the purposes of validating credit information and collecting debts. We may disclose your personally identifiable information if we reasonably believe we are required to do so by operation of law, which may include, but is not limited to a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on REALPOOR.COM.

We keep the information you have given us for as long as you are a member on the site or for as long as we are required to do so by law, which ever is longer.
CAN I CHANGE THE INFORMATION I HAVE ALREADY GIVEN YOU?

DO YOU MONITOR ONLINE BEHAVIOR?
This is a community site where the members communicate to share the information using our forums. Also our members communicate with each other through instant private messages.

WHAT SECURITY FEATURES DO YOU HAVE?
The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our registration or order forms, our payment processors encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). SSL is the leading security protocol on the Internet. It ensures that information being transferred over the network is private through a process called encryption. Once encrypted the information is an unintelligible code until it is decoded upon arrival at the authorized destination.
REALPOOR.COM follows generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.

This is particularly concerning trading of game accounts, where members should not post account name in public, because it could lead to suspension or ban from the game.
