Your privacy is important to us. REALfarmacy.com provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive from you when you use the REALfarmacy.com website (https://www.realfarmacy.com) and any other REALfarmacy.com service. Together we refer to the REALfarmacy.com services as “REALfarmacy Properties”. This Privacy Policy applies only to information that is provided to us through REALfarmacy Properties. This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the REALfarmacy.com website.
Cookies
Like many websites, we may use “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies for two purposes. First, we may use persistent cookies to authorize you and ensure that only approved REALfarmacy.com members may use the service. Second, we may use session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Sites, to better understand how you interact with the Sites, and to monitor aggregate usage by REALfarmacy Users and web traffic routing on the Sites. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Sites and Service and then close your browser. Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a user’s prior visits to your website or other websites. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from any websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Sites or all functionality of the Services. To opt-out of certain cookies and for more information, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices and/or http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp .
Google’s and other advertisers’ use of cookies enables it and its partners to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and/or other sites on the Internet.
Users may opt out of personalized Google advertising by visiting Ads Settings.

You may opt-out of providing your location information to us when you are using mobile devices. If you do not want us to use your location information as described in this Privacy Policy, you should turn off the location services located in your account settings (if available) or in your mobile device settings.

Information We Collect
You may voluntarily provide us with information, including:
Email address
Information you provide when you contact us (for example your name when contacting regarding support)
Any other information you voluntarily provide us with in using the website.
We automatically collect other information about you, including:
Device identifiers as well as certain software and hardware information about your device;
Your Internet Protocol (IP) address;
Domain name of your Internet service provider;
Your geographic location;
The Service pages that you visit and the date and time of your visits;
Aggregated information that cannot be used to specifically identify you when you visit or use the Service; and
We may collect information about the other apps that you have used via our Advertising Partners or other Third Parties.
We may collect information about you from:
third party social networking services;
commercially available sources;
our affiliates; and
our third party business partners.
We may combine any of the information we collect from or about you and use it in the manner described in this Privacy Policy.
We may supplement any of the information we collect from or about you with other information.
Your direct feedback and comments are valuable, especially when combined with information automatically gathered about how you use REALfarmacy Properties. To that end, REALfarmacy collects key information that helps us improve the product. Some of this information may be personal information about you (e.g., your email address, Facebook login ID, sites you visit). We may also collect personal information in ways that don’t involve REALfarmacy products and services – for instance, if you send us an email with your phone number in it. We also collect information about your use of REALfarmacy Properties and the configuration of your system. While this information is collected anonymously, it may still be possible to associate the collected information with you (e.g., through heuristics or in combination with third-party data about you). However, it is our policy not to make such associations, and to make it difficult to determine such associations.
If you don’t want us to collect this information, open a browser window in Private or Incognito Mode, which can be accessed from the browser menu.
If you open a window in “Privacy” or “Incognito” mode, no data from that window will be collected or sent to REALfarmacy, and all data from that window including history and cache generated by activity in that window will be deleted as soon as you close that window.
Information Collection, Use and Disclosure
In this policy, when we say we “collect” information, we generally mean that your browser keeps track of the information locally and then periodically uploads it to our Metrics Service.
Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our services, features, and content.
Your Personal Information. When you communicate with us or use REALfarmacy Properties, we may collect personal information about you. For instance, if you email us requesting support, you’ll provide us with your email address so we can respond to you. Personal Information can also include, but is not limited to, your name, phone number, IP address, or home address. (We might not ask you for all or any of these things, but you might provide them to us without our asking – for instance, in an email to us.) We use your Personal Information to provide the Services and to respond to your requests for support.
Pseudonymous Information. We also collect other information that you provide or that is provided to us about you when using REALfarmacy Properties (e.g., without limitation, what search engine(s) you use, and your individual preferences, etc.)
How We Use Your Information. We don’t sell your Personal Information. We use your Personal Information to provide you with and improve REALfarmacy Properties, including to respond to your requests for support. Your Pseudonymous Information, such as device ID’s, other unique identifiers such as “hashed” email addresses and profile information can be made available by REALfarmacy to its partners to help target ads to you based on your presumed interests.
Aggregating Information. We may aggregate the Pseudonymous Information we collect with similar information collected from other REALfarmacy Users to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of REALfarmacy Properties, and to analyze and understand how REALfarmacy Properties are used. We may also use information you provide without aggregating it to serve you specifically; for instance, to deliver a product to you according to your preferences or restrictions.
Demographic Profiling. We might also use non-aggregated information for development or demographic profiling purposes, but any such use would not be personally identifiable.
Newsletters. We also may use your email if you sign up for newsletters to occasionally email you updates. If you decide at any time you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications or contact us as explaining in Your Data Protection Rights section below.
Log Data. When you visit the REALfarmacy Web Site, whether you’re using REALfarmacy or as a non-registered user just visiting, our servers automatically record information your browser sends whenever you visit a website (“Log Data”). This is different from the information REALfarmacy will send included in the “Please Read This Carefully” section at the top of this Policy; here, we’re talking about information that’s automatically collected by our web server in order to show you pages on the REALfarmacy Web Site. This data is collected whether or not you use REALfarmacy, but only when you visit our website. This Log Data may include information such as your computer’s Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, the web page you were visiting before you came to our Sites, pages of our Sites that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Sites, access times and dates, and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Sites and the Service and for the Sites’ technical administration, to increase our Sites’ functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor it to our visitors’ needs. We also use this information to verify that visitors to the Sites meet the criteria required to process their requests.
Legal basis for processing personal information (EEA Users only)
If you are a User from the European Economic Area, our or our customer’s legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.
However, we will normally collect personal information from you only (i) where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, (ii) where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your rights, or (iii) where we have your consent to do so.
If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contact with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information).
If we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), this interest will normally be to operate our platform and communicating with you as necessary to provide our services to you and for our legitimate commercial interest, for instance, when responding to your queries, improving our platform, undertaking marketing, or for the purposes of detecting or preventing illegal activities. We may have other legitimate interests and if appropriate we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.
If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us using the contact details provided under the “Contacting us” heading below.
Information Sharing and Disclosure
Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement. REALfarmacy cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties that we believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal processes (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of REALfarmacy or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, illegal, unethical or legally actionable. We may also transfer your Personal Information to third party service providers that assist us with carrying out the purposes identified in this Privacy Policy. Lastly, we may disclose your Personal Information for any other purpose to which you Consent.
Business Transfers
In the event REALfarmacy (or any of its affiliates) goes through a business transition, such as a merger, consolidation, restructuring, acquisition by another company, sale or assignment of rights or assets or a portion thereof, or other company change, we may transfer users’ information, including Personal Information, and other business data in connection with that business transition (e.g., to a subsequent owner, co-owner, or operator of REALfarmacyk, or any affiliates and trusted agents, service providers, or partners thereof), including during the course of any due diligence process.
Security
REALfarmacy is very concerned with safeguarding your information. We employ appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access.
International Transfer
Where transferred internationally, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy. These include implementing the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information between our group companies, which require all group companies to protect personal information they process from the EEA in accordance with European Union data protection law.
Our Standard Contractual Clauses can be provided on request. We have implemented similar appropriate safeguards with our third party service providers and partners and further details can be provided upon request.
Retention
We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
Your data protection rights
If you are a resident of the European Economic Area, you have the following data protection rights:
If you wish to access, correct, update or request deletion of your personal information, you can do so at any time by contacting us using the contact details provided under the “Contacting Us” heading below.
In addition, you can object to processing of your personal information, ask us to restrict processing of your personal information or request portability of your personal information. Again, you can exercise these rights by contacting us using the contact details provided under the “Contacting Us” heading below.
You have the right to opt-out of marketing communications we send you at any time. You can exercise this right by clicking on the “unsubscribe” or “opt-out” link in the marketing e-mails we send you. To opt-out of other forms of marketing (such as postal marketing or telemarketing), then please contact us using the contact details provided under the “Contacting Us” heading below.
Similarly, if we have collected and process your personal information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal information. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority. Contact details for data protection authorities in the European Economic Area are available here – http://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm.
We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
