Privacy – Reading Eggs
This Privacy Policy describes how Blake eLearning, including its related companies which handle personal information (Company), collects, holds, uses and discloses personal information.
Blake eLearning is committed to protecting the privacy of your personal information. An individual who provides personal information to the Company, either directly or through a business partner or service provider, has ready access to this Policy.
By providing personal information to the Company and having access to this Policy, either directly or through a business partner or service provider, an individual consents to the Company collecting, holding, using and disclosing personal information in accordance with this Policy.
What information do we collect and how do we use it?
Free trial registration
When you sign up for a free trial of Reading Eggs, Reading Eggs Junior, Reading Eggspress and Mathseeds, we collect your first and last name, email address, phone number, your country and postcode. Once you log into your free trial account, we also collect your child's first and last name and their date of birth. Collection of these details is necessary for us to tailor our communications to you, manage your child's progress through the programs, and ensure we can better respond to your customer service requests. You are entitled to provide us with a pseudonym if you wish to sign up anonymously. If you choose to sign up anonymously you will still have full access to the trial and all its features.
Subscription and product purchases
When you subscribe to Reading Eggs, Reading Eggs Junior, Reading Eggspress or Mathseeds, or purchase any of our products, we collect your first and last name and your credit card details. If you are purchasing one of our products, we also collect your address for delivery. When you subscribe or purchase a product, we do not allow the option for you to use a pseudonym as we require this information for payment and/or delivery.
Surveys
Our surveys are designed to collect your feedback so that we can improve our programs and the way we market to you. When you complete one of our surveys, we may collect your first and last name, your email address, your home address if the survey entitles you to a free gift, your child's age, your income, as well as your opinion or other personal information relating to our survey questions. You are not obliged to complete any of our surveys, either as part of our free trial or subscription programs or otherwise. You are entitled to provide us with a pseudonym if you wish to complete our surveys anonymously, although if completion of our survey entitles you to a free gift, we will require your correct name and address details to deliver it to you.
Social media
We periodically run competitions through the Website and our social media channels. By entering into a competition, you acknowledge that we may use your personal information for the purposes of administering the competition and to contact you about our products and services.
We may also provide you with joint promotional offers in conjunction with other third parties. These offers are designed to be relevant to you, but should you not wish to receive this, you may select the 'Unsubscribe' link at the bottom of every email we send you. Alternatively you may contact us at dpo@blake.com.au for home data enquiries. For Reading Eggs school data enquiries please contact readingeggssupport@edmentum.com. For Mathseeds school data enquiries please contact privacy@3plearning.com.
Cookies
Like many websites, we use cookies to enhance your experience and gather information about visitors and visits to our websites. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser (if you allow) that enables the site’s or service provider’s systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. For instance, we use cookies to help us remember and process the items in your shopping cart. They are also used to help us understand your preferences based on previous or current site activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services. We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.
We may contract third-party service providers to assist us in better understanding our site visitors. These service providers are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf except to help us conduct and improve our business.
You can choose to have your web browser (like Google Chrome or Internet Explorer) warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser's help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. If you turn cookies off, you won't have access to many features that make your site experience more efficient and some of our services will not function properly. However, you can still place orders over the telephone by contacting our customer service team.
Email communications
When you sign up for a free trial, you will automatically receive promotional and student report emails from Reading Eggs, Reading Eggspress and Mathseeds. To opt out of these email communications, you can click on the 'Unsubscribe' link at the bottom of the email, or you can simply log into your account and click on the 'My Account' option, where you can choose to opt in or out of emails.
Data storage and security
Limiting access to education records
Education records are only accessible to users who are logged in and have been successfully authenticated by entering a username and password. Students are only able to access their own progress, and teachers can only view students from within their school.
Student and teacher data can only be accessed by Blake eLearning staff and partners. Data is never shared with third parties without explicit permission.
Management of historical data
When a subscription to the application expires, we retain the data in our database. If the school would like this data to be deleted, they can contact our customer service team and we will be happy to oblige.
Challenging the accuracy of student or teacher data
If a teacher believes there is a problem with any data that has been collected, they can contact our customer service team and we will investigate the matter. If a problem is identified, we will seek a solution to fix it.
Ensuring data is secure and protected
Student and teacher data is stored in a secure database on Amazon Web Services (AWS). Access to these servers is limited to the application, and by software developers at Blake eLearning, via secure shell.
Passwords for users of the system are encrypted using salt and hash technologies.
All data transferred within Reading Eggs, Reading Eggs Junior, Reading Eggspress and Mathseeds is protected by SSL. SSL is a technology that makes your data illegible in transit. If anyone were to intercept communication between our servers and your computer, they would not be able to easily decipher what was being passed back and forth.
Disclosure of information to third parties
Blake eLearning does not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal information to third party sources. The term 'third party sources' does not include Blake eLearning's related companies.
It also does not include website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others' rights, property or safety. However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising or other uses.
Third party links
In an attempt to provide you with increased value, we may include third party links on our site. These linked sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these linked sites (including if a specific link does not work).
Changes to our privacy policy
We may change, modify, or revise this Privacy Policy in order to comply with any applicable laws, to reflect changes in our processes or for any other reason at any time. Material changes in our Privacy Policy will be communicated to you, but we also encourage you to check our Privacy Policy periodically to read about any changes, modifications, or revisions. You will be deemed to have consented to any variations by your continued use of the Websites or Platforms following any changes being made.
