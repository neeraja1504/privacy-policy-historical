Privacy Policy — Republic
Nothing is more important to us than the trust of our users.
This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) describes how, OpenDeal Inc. and its subsidiaries OpenDeal Portal LLC and Republic Crypto LLC (together “Republic,” “we,” “us,” or “our”), collect, use and disclose any personal information you provide to us when using the site, services, and applications offered by Republic (the “Services”) on and through https://republic.co (the “Site”). By accessing the Site or using the Services, you acknowledge and consent to our practices described below. Your access to the Site, use of the Services, this Privacy Policy and all defined terms used herein, are subject to and governed by our Republic Portal Terms of Service and RAS Terms of Service (as applicable).
We emphatically value the trust of our users. We are committed to protecting your privacy and preserving your trust. Please carefully review this Privacy Policy to learn about choices available to you regarding our use of your information.
Information We Collect and How We Use It
We collect information that may personally identify you (“Personally Identifiable Information”), such as when you sign up for an account on the Site, make an investment, provide payment instructions, fill out bank form information, comment on a part of the Site, provide your passport or identification-document, or provide us with access to your accounts on third-party sites (“Third-Party Sites”). The personal information collected from the Third-Party Sites may be used to register you on our Site and to provide some of our Services. You may be able to revoke our access to your account on the Third-Party Sites by updating the appropriate settings in the account preferences of the respective Third-Party Sites. You understand that certain features of our Site may not be available to you if you choose to remove our access to your account with the Third-Party Sites.
Personally Identifiable Information may include, among other things, your email address, name, phone number, birthday, address, investment experience, and your educational or professional history. If you choose to invest through our Site, we will collect payment information from you, such as financial account information or card payment information, and we may collect information to verify your income or net-worth. Please note that we do not store your card payment information, but we do store other financial information. If you choose to add an investment entity to your account, we will also collect information about the entity. The decision to provide this information is optional; however, if you decide not to register or provide such information, you may not be able to use certain features of the Site or the Services.
We may automatically collect information that does not identify an individual user, such as IP (internet protocol) address, ISP (internet service provider), the web browser used to visit the Site, the time the Site is visited, which web pages were visited on the Site, a mobile device-type identifier, and other anonymous Site usage data. We may use third-party analytics services which provide us with a clearer picture of how you use the Site, such as where you click on the Site, non-sensitive text entered into the Site, and mouse movements.
We also may use cookies and web beacons. Most web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, certain features of the Site may not work if you delete or disable cookies. If you choose to make an account, we provide private messaging services between registered-users of the Site; while we do not monitor these messages, we will periodically select a few to review for compliance and audit purposes; therefore, you should assume any message you send through the Site may later be accessed by our staff or our regulators for compliance or audit purposes.
How We Share and Use Your Information
We may share information you provide to us amongst our affiliated entities. If the Services you use are exclusively provided by one of the entities, you have the right to limit the other affiliated entities from contacting you for marketing purposes (“Affiliate Marketing”), please see Your Choice About Your Information below for details.
We provide the Personally Identifiable Information on a confidential basis to non-affiliated companies we engage as vendors or agents (i) to facilitate the Services provided on our site, such as escrow agents, transfer agents, counsels, advisors, accountants, banks and other financial service providers, and (ii) to service our operation, such as maintaining software or servers, designing or implementing marketing initiatives on our behalf, or conducting audit or testing of any aspect of our operation or Services. Information will be shared with such parties only to the extent reasonably necessary for them to perform services for us or on our behalf and pursuant to confidentiality obligations, or in response to information requests, subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, from law enforcement agencies, self-regulatory organizations, state, federal and foreign regulators.
In addition to some of the specific uses of information we describe in this Privacy Policy, we may use information that we receive for the following: (i) to deliver and improve our Services; (ii) to manage your account and provide you with customer support; (iii) to perform research and analysis about your use of the Services; (iv) to develop, display, and track content and advertising tailored to your interests on the Services and other sites, including providing our advertisements to you when you visit other sites or mobile application; (v) to diagnose or fix technology problems; (vi) to automatically update the Services; (vii) to verify your identify and prevent fraud or other unauthorized or illegal activity; (viii) to enforce or exercise any rights in our Terms of Service; (ix) to provide users with statistics on how they use the Site relative to other anonymous users, and (x) to perform functions or services as otherwise described to you at the time of collection.
Republic does not sell any customer data to third-party firms.
Information Provided in Discussion Forums
Securities offerings on Republic’s Portal all include a publicly accessible discussion forum as well as an “investment reason” forum. Additionally, other pages on the Site allow for public comment and discussion (“Public Comment”). You should be aware that any information you provide in these forums may be read, collected, and used by the Site’s users and the general public. Information that you disclose in any of these forums is unencrypted, public information, and there is no expectation of privacy or confidentiality there; we reserve the right to use all Public Comments on the Site for marketing purposes. Please refrain from disclosing any Personally Identifiable Information about yourself or anyone else in these discussion forums.
If you choose to post a Public Comment on the Site through whatever means provided by the Site, we may share that Public Comment through other channels, including through the Site’s social media presences, as we see fit. If you subsequently delete or make private your Public Comment, we will discontinue any subsequent use, but cannot retract previous re-publications of your previously Public Comment.
If you choose to make your investment public (“Public Investment Notice”) through whatever means provided by the Site, we may share that “Public Investment Notice” through other channels, including through the Site’s social media presences, as we see fit. If you subsequently make your Public Investment Notice private, or withdraw such investment, we will discontinue any subsequent use, but cannot retract previous re-publications of your previously-public Public Investment Notice.
Note also that in the ordinary course of internet activity, certain information may be sent from your browser to third parties such as advertising networks and analytics companies. Republic has no control over the information sent from your browser to those networks or other third parties and recommends that you ensure that your browser settings prevent the disclosure of information you would not like to share.

You may decline to submit Personally Identifiable Information through the Services, in which case Republic may not be able to provide certain Services to you.
