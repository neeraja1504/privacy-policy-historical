Republic Wireless Inc. (“Republic Wireless” or “we”), provides wireless communications solutions. To learn more about Republic Wireless, please see “How can you contact us?” below.
We make the security and confidentiality of the personal information that you provide to us a top priority.
This policy applies to our members in the United States and to visitors to our Web sites and mobile applications, including  republicwireless.com. Please read our Privacy Policy carefully.
Republic Wireless may update this Privacy Policy in the future. We will notify our community members about material changes to this Privacy Policy by either sending a notice to the email address you provide to us or by placing a prominent notice on our Web sites.
What Information Do We Collect from You?
General
We receive and store any information you enter on our Web sites or communicate with us in any other way. This includes information that identifies you (“personal information”), including your first and last name, telephone number, postal and email addresses, user name(s) and password(s), if applicable. We also may request information about your communications needs and preferences. You can choose not to provide information, but we may require some information about you to use our Web sites and/or services. We also may require some personal information to answer your questions or conduct other transactions on our Web sites. When you contact us, we may monitor or record the communication or keep a record of it to help us train employees and provide customer service.
We do not share your personal information with unaffiliated third parties so they can serve advertisements to you.
Information Automatically Collected Due to Use of Our Wireless Services
We collect information about our wireless services that you use, including network traffic data, call records, websites visited, applications and features used, service options chosen, mobile and device number(s) and other similar information. We collect and use data regarding your mobile device location for a variety of purposes as described below. We also may collect and use mobile usage information and other information for certain business and marketing reports as described below. We may automatically measure and monitor network performance and the performance of your Internet connection to improve your, or our, overall service levels. We also may access information about your mobile device or device settings to provide customized support or to install or suggest specific applications or services that you use or are necessary for your use of certain services we provide to you.
Other Information Automatically Collected
We also automatically collect some information about your computer when you visit our Web sites. For example, we collect session data, including your IP address, Web browser software, and referring Web site. We also may collect information about your online activity, such as content viewed and pages visited. This information also may permit us to identify users associated with multiple devices used to access our sites or services.
We may use cookies for automated data collection. Cookies are small data text files that, if your Web browser permits, can be stored on your computer’s hard drive. Republic Wireless and its Web sites use cookies:
To help us recognize your Web browser as a previous visitor and save and remember any preferences set while your Web browser visited our Web sites. For example, if you register on our Web sites, we may use cookies to remember your registration information so you do not need to log into our Web sites each time you visit. We also may save your password in a cookie, if you checked the box entitled “Save this password for automatic sign-in” (or other similar words).
To help us customize the content, Web site experience, and advertisements provided to you on our Web sites and on other Web sites across the Internet. For example, when you access a web page, a cookie automatically recognizes your Web browser as you navigate on the Internet and presents you with information and advertising based on your apparent interests.
To help measure and research the effectiveness of the features, offerings, advertisements, and email communications (by determining which emails you open and act upon) of our Web sites.
Our Web sites also may use Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or Web bugs). These Web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, that we place in the code of a Web page. Web beacons allow us to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Web sites to another, deliver or communicate with cookies, understand whether you have come to our Web sites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party Web site, and improve the performance of our Web sites. We also may allow our service providers to use Web beacons to help us understand which emails recipients have opened and track the visitor traffic on our Web sites.
As noted above, we may use these technologies to serve interest-based ads. Many of the advertisements you see on our Web sites are served by Republic Wireless or its service providers and may be based on our collection of data as described herein. However, we also allow third parties to collect information about your online activities through cookies and other technologies, and they may do so over time and across different websites. These third parties include advertising networks and our business partners, who collect information when you view or interact our site or services, our ads, or ads you see on our sites or services. We do not have access to or control cookies or other technologies these third parties may use to collect information about your interests; our Privacy Policy does not cover either these third parties or their information practices.
We also receive and use your mobile device location to provide our wireless voice and data services, emergency services, and location- based applications and services offered by us and third parties, including mapping, navigation, weather, mapping and other applications or tools. Wireless applications and services offered by us and third parties also use mobile device location data. We may use mobile usage information and other information for certain business and marketing reports. This information includes the location of your device, your use of our products and services, and other demographic and interest information obtained by us from other sources. We may use this information to prepare aggregated business and marketing reports that we may use ourselves or share with others for their use, but which do not personally identify you. We also may share location information with other companies in a way that does not personally identify you.
For more information about managing cookies or our use of data we collect automatically, please review “What choices do you have regarding the collection and use of your information?” below.
Information from Other Sources
We also may periodically obtain both personal and non-personal information about you from affiliated entities, business partners and third parties and add it to other information about you. For example, if you visit  republicwireless.com  by “clicking-through” from a site operated by one of our business partners, and you have registered with that partner, then the partner may share with us information about you that you have provided to that partner. For example, we may receive your contact information and demographic information. If you access third party services, such as social media services, through our Web sites, we also may collect information such as your user name, password, and other information made available to us through those third party services. We also may obtain from consumer reporting agencies information about you that helps us with customer authentication and related decisions. We also may obtain additional information about you from outside companies that collect information, including demographic and interest data. We also may obtain contact information and other marketing lead information from third parties, which we may add to other information about you that we maintain.

Some information related to certain communications services that we provide to you constitutes Customer Proprietary Network Information (“CPNI”). For example, CPNI includes to whom, where and when you make calls. Specific federal laws and regulations protect CPNI.

You will receive a privacy notice regarding CPNI when you first contract for or order service and every two years thereafter. You may choose to opt out of the sharing of your CPNI within our family of companies (and their divisions) for certain marketing purposes. For more information regarding CPNI, please see  republicwireless.com/legal.
How Do We Use Any Feedback You May Provide?
Any anonymized data that you send to us such as your questions, suggestions, ideas or other creative material belongs to us and we will not treat it as confidential.

The Digital Advertising Alliance also maintains a similar opt-out that may permit you to opt out of the use of your information to identify your devices across multiple websites. It can be found here: http://optout.aboutads.info/\#!/.
If we collect your device’s location when you use our mobile apps, we will ask your permission. Your phone’s location services settings permit you to control collection of your device location through our apps.
How Do We Protect Your Information?
While no company or Web site can guarantee security, we have implemented appropriate administrative, technical, and physical security procedures to help protect the personal information you provide to us. For example, we permit only authorized personnel to access personal information, and they only may do so for permitted business functions. We also employ firewalls and intrusion detection systems to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your information that we maintain. These measures include administrative safeguards, such as policies, procedures, and training, as well as physical and technical controls, such as encryption when personal information is transmitted across a website and where appropriate, for other transmissions, for example, certain information in cookies. However, we make no guarantee, representation or warranty that use of our services or Web sites is protected from all security threats, viruses, or other vulnerabilities or that your information always will be secure.
