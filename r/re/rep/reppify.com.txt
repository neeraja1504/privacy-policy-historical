This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide to use through the Services. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms of Service (the "Terms" ). This Privacy Policy applies to information that you provide to us through the Services.
As used in this policy, the terms "using" and "processing" information include using cookies on a computer, subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using or handling information in any way, including, but not limited to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring information within our organization or among our affiliates within the United States or internationally.
Information Collection and Use
When using our Services, we will ask you for certain personally identifiable information. This refers to information about you that can be used to contact or identify you, and information on your use or potential use of the Services and related services ("Personal Information"). Personal Information that we might collect would include things like, your name, phone number, your email address and home and business postal addresses, credit card or other billing information, and website URLs, and any other information or data that you provide to the Services, such as any of your social networking site accounts that you link to your Account. You are under no obligation to provide us with these credentials, and can de-link your accounts at any time. We use your Personal Information to provide the Services and administer your inquiries. You may change or delete any information that you provide; please use caution when linking or posting any Personal Information, as such information may be viewed by other users of the Services.
We use Personal Information for the following purposes: (i) to administer the Services, (ii) to enable users to easily navigate the Services, (iii) to provide, improve and optimize the Services, (iv) to better understand users needs and interests, (iv) to personalize your experience, (v) to provide you with software updates and/or product announcements, and (vi) to provide you with further information and offers from us that we believe you may find useful or interesting. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications or select the appropriate option in your user profile. (See "Changing or Deleting Information," below.)
When you visit the Services, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website ("Log Data"). This Log Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Services, pages of our website and Services that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Services, access times and dates, and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Services and for the Services' technical administration, to increase our Services' functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor it to our visitors' needs. For example, some of this information is collected so that when you visit the Services again, it will recognize you and serve information appropriate to your interests. We also use this information to verify that visitors to the Services meet the criteria required to process their requests.
We also use "cookies" to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies for two purposes. First, we utilize persistent cookies to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to the Services. Second, we utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Services, to better understand how you interact with the Services and to monitor aggregate usage by users of the Services and web traffic routing on the Services. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Services and then close your browser. Third party advertisers on the Services may also place or read cookies on your browser. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions or all functionality of the Services.
Information Sharing and Disclosure
We will not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide the Services, when we otherwise have your permission, or under the following circumstances:
Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information. We may share aggregated information that does not include Personal Information and we may otherwise disclose non-identifying Information and Log Data with third parties for industry analysis, demographic and analytical profiling and other purposes. Any aggregated information shared in these contexts will not contain your Personal Information.
Service Providers.

These third parties have access to your Personal Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose. We may also provide Personal Information to our business partners or other trusted entities for the purpose of providing you with information on goods or services we believe will be of interest to you. You can, at any time, opt out of receiving such communications by setting the appropriate option in your user profile or by contacting us at support [at] reppify.com.
Reppify Clients. We will share your Personal Information with Reppify clients requesting your Reppify Score only with your permission. If you have provided your Personal Information to the Services to enable Reppify to generate a Reppify Score for use by employers for employment screening purposes or other uses regulated by the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), Reppify will not create a Reppify Score about you for a Reppify client requesting your Reppify Score unless Reppify's client completes a certification required by the FCRA. In this certification, Reppify's client certifies to Reppify that the information obtained through the Services is sought to be used for (or to be provided for) employment purposes; tenant screening purposes; purposes related to a business transaction initiated by the consumer; other permissible purposes as defined by the FCRA); and no other purpose, and that it has, to the extent required by applicable law, obtained your informed consent to use such information, including, when applicable, your Personal Information.

Our Services may contain links to other websites for news and other information. If you choose to visit an advertiser by "clicking on" a banner ad or other type of advertisement, or click on another third party link, you will be directed to that third party's websites.
