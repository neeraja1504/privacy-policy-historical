Personal Information: When you register for an account, you will be asked to provide your name, email address, a user name, a password, and other personally identifying information (collectively, “Personally Identifiable Information”). You may select any username you want, except that your username cannot be an impersonation, the same or confusingly similar to a famous trademark, or be a term that is offensive in any way. You may, but are not obligated to, use your own name. If you do use your own name, you consent to it being passed to others by use of the functions of this site. FRC reserves the right to reject or remove any username that does not meet applicable standards. Please note that your Personally Identifiable Information, in addition to other demographic data, will be retained in order to allow you to use your account. It is our policy to use Personally Identifiable Information to provide our technology and services, and not to provide Personally Identifiable Information to anyone outside of FRC without your consent (but see “Exceptions to this Privacy Policy” below).
Submitted Material: When you use the FRC website, Repost.Us, and functionality, you will provide certain materials and content. As you participate in the website, you will also provide certain information regarding such participation to us. As a reminder, whenever you share information on FRC in your profile, in public areas, or with specific individuals, such information can be viewed by such persons.
Public Content: If you provide content to FRC for public view, we may distribute that content to a wider audience by sharing it (or portions of it) with third parties so that they can publish it on their websites and other media platforms. FRC may, in some instances, ask that such third parties credit you as the source of these contributions, and will provide your account name and profile photo, if any, to them for such purpose.
Website Visit Information: When you visit our website, we may create a log of your visit with information, which includes information such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address; URL information; browser type and language; and the date, time, and duration of your visit.

Communications: If you send us emails, faxes, letters, or other communications, we may keep these in order to address your issue.
Third Party Content: FRC may make available third-party content, applications and information for syndication from participating publishers. The information collected by FRC when you enable or use content from third-party publishers is processed under this Privacy Policy.

FRC may provide your Personally Identifiable Information at the request of such third-party publishers but only to the extent that you use such third-party publisher’s content. FRC employees and agents will not share your Personally Identifiable Information except as required to adequately provide services to such third party publishers.

FRC is not responsible for the privacy or security of any information, personal or otherwise, that you may choose to communicate or exchange using the functionality of this site.

Our Policy Toward Children
The FRC website is intended for general audiences and is not directed to children younger than eighteen years of age in the United States.

We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of thirteen.
Your California Privacy Rights
Residents of the State of California, under the California Civil Code, have the right to request from companies conducting business in California a list of all third parties to which the Company has disclosed personal information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes and a disclosure of the shared information. Alternatively, the law provides that if the company has a privacy policy that provides you with an “opt-out” choice for use of your personal information by third parties for marketing purposes, the Company may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options.
This site qualifies for the alternative option. Its privacy policy provides you with information on how you may opt-out from the use of your personal information by third parties for direct marketing purposes. Therefore, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received your personal information during the preceding year for marketing purposes.
If you are a California resident and request information about how to exercise your third-party disclosure choices, send a request to the following email address privacy@freerangecontent.com.
