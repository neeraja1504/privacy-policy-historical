Cookies and Automated Information Collection
Like many websites, Replay Gaming and service providers acting on our behalf, like Google Analytics, store log files and use tracking technologies such as "cookies" to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer’s hard disk or your mobile device for record-keeping purposes. The Service may send cookies to a computer or a mobile device when a user accesses or views a Service.

We and our service providers may also employ other technologies including (i) web beacons, which allow us to know if a certain page was visited or whether an e-mail was opened; (ii) tracking pixels, which allow us to advertise more efficiently and effectively by excluding our current users from certain promotional messages, identifying the source of a new installation or delivering ads to you on other websites; and (iii) local shared objects also known as flash cookies, which help us to reduce fraud, remember your in-game preferences and speed up load times.
We and our service providers use these log files, tags, and tracking technologies to collect and analyze certain kinds of technical information, including:
the type of device you are using;
your operating system version;
your mobile device’s identifiers, like your MAC Address, Identifier For Advertising (IDFA), and/or International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI);
your browser types;
your browser language;
referring and exit pages, and URLs;
platform type;
the number of clicks on a page or feature;
domain names;
landing pages;
pages viewed and the order of those pages;
the amount of time spent on particular pages; and
game state and the date and time of activity on our websites or games.
In some cases, we will connect this information with your social network ID or Replay Gaming user ID.

3. How We Use the Information We Collect and With Whom We Share It
How We Use Your Information
The main use of the information we collect and store is to provide a better gaming experience, but there are other uses as well. The uses for which we collect and store your information include:
to create your game accounts and allow you to play our games;
to operate, improve and optimize our Services and our players’ experiences;
to identify and suggest connections with other Replay Gaming players and personalize our Services to you;
to enable players to communicate with each other;
to provide technical support and respond to player inquiries;
to protect the safety and well-being of our players;
to protect Replay Gaming's rights and property in connection with our Services;
to prevent fraud or potentially illegal activities, and to enforce our Terms of Service;
to notify players of in-game updates, new products or promotional offers;
to administer rewards, surveys, contests, or other promotional activities or events sponsored or managed by us;
to comply with our legal obligations, resolve any disputes we may have with you or other players, and to enforce our agreements with third parties; and
to conduct research.
One important use of your information is communication. If you have provided your e-mail address to Replay Gaming, we will use it to respond to Customer Support inquiries, and keep you informed of your in-game activity, including messages from friends, let you know about in-game status and promotions. Some messages, like private messages to friends, may include your name and profile photo. We may also send promotional e-mail messages ("Promotional Communications") directly, in accordance with your marketing preferences. Each Promotional Communication will offer you choices about receiving additional messages. Receipt of such communications depends on Replay Gaming having certain contact information from you.
How We Share Your Information
We may disclose or publish aggregated information (information about you and other players collectively that is not intended to specifically identify you, for example, players between the ages of 30 and 40 who live London) and other non-personal information about our players for industry analysis, demographic profiling, marketing, analytics, advertising, and other business purposes.
Aggregated and Analytical Information
We use anonymous, statistical or aggregated information and may share it with our partners for legitimate business purposes. It has no effect on your privacy, because there is no reasonable way to extract data from the aggregated information that can be associated with you. We will share your identifiable information only subject to the terms of this policy, or subject to your prior consent.
Friends and Other Replay Gaming Players and/or
The Service supports and often encourages you to interact with other players. If you register through a social network (for example, Facebook Connect), your social network friends who are registered on Replay Poker will automatically be added as Friends. Other players, regardless of whether they are your social network friends or not, will be able to see descriptions of your game activity (including the identification of any Replay Poker games you have played), communicate with you within our Services, and view your game profile, which will include your username and your profile picture, if you have one. Any other player will see your game profile if you are playing at the same table or if they are watching a replay of a poker hand you participated in. Other players may also be able to send you  friend requests through the related  Replay Gaming’s communication channels.
Third-Party Service Providers
We will share your information with third-party companies to perform services on our behalf, like processing payments, analyzing data, optimizing game play, e-mail delivery, hosting services, customer service and to help us in our marketing efforts, including managing and delivering contextual and tailored advertisements. We contractually require these third-party service providers to maintain the confidentiality of the information we share with them, and we contractually require them not use your information for anything other than to provide services on our behalf.
Sale or Merger
In the event that Replay Gaming undergoes a business transition (including proposed transactions), like a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or part its assets (like selling a game), we may disclose or transfer all of your information, including personal information, to the successor organization in the transition. We will make reasonable efforts to let you and other players know (in the way described in Changes to Our Privacy Policy) of the business transition before transferring your personal information.

6. How we protect the information we store and share about you.
Security of Your Information
Replay Gaming has made reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to secure your information both online and offline from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure, and we are committed to the protection of customer information. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
When you sign into your Replay Gaming account or enter payment information, we or our third-party payment processor use secure socket layer technology ("SSL") to encrypt the transmission of that information. While we take reasonable precautions against possible security breaches of our Services and our customer databases and records, no website or Internet transmission is completely secure, and Replay Gaming cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur and that third parties will never be able to overcome those measures or use your personal information for improper purposes.
Also please note that email and messaging systems are not considered secure, so Replay Gaming discourages you from sending Replay Gaming personal information through these media. We urge you to take steps to keep your personal information safe (including your account password), and to log out of your account after use. If you access our Services through a social network and your social network account is hacked, this may lead to unauthorized play of your Replay Gaming games without your permission. So, be careful to keep your Account Information secure.
Although we strive to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data while it is being transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we have procedures and security features in place to try to prevent unauthorized access. If you have questions about the security of our websites, please submit a ticket via the applicable support channel of the game.
Safety, Security and Compliance with Law
Your information, and the contents of all of your online communications in our Services and between You and Replay Gaming may be accessed and monitored as needed to provide our Service and may be disclosed:
when we have a good faith belief that we have to disclose the information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, or legal process (for example, a court order, search warrant or subpoena);
to satisfy any laws or regulations that apply;
where we believe in our sole discretion that the Service is being used in committing a crime, including to report such criminal activity or to share information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection, credit risk reduction, and other security precautions;
when we have a good faith belief that there is an emergency that poses a threat to the health and/or safety of you, another person or the public generally; and
to protect the rights or property of Replay Gaming and other applicable third parties, including to enforce our Terms of Service.

If you are a resident in a jurisdiction, where transfer of your personal information to another jurisdiction requires your consent, then you provide us your express and unambiguous consent to such transfer for us to provide you with our services.
How Long We Keep Your Information
