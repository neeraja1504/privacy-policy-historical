(Revised May 22, 2018)
This is our policy regarding maintaining the privacy of personal information we collect online in connection with the reprorights.org or reproductiverights.org website (the "Site").
Please note that, by using the Site, you signify your agreement to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site.
Information That We Collect and Track
As further described below, we collect two types of information about Site visitors: (i) personal information that individual visitors provide when contributing to The Center, or voluntarily at certain other points; and (ii) tracking data, which is automatically collected from every Site visitor.
Personal Information
There are several features on our Site which allow you to volunteer personal information, such as your name, e-mail address, postal address, phone number and credit card information. For example, you may volunteer personal information when you:
make an online donation through the Site;
complete a form to subscribe to any of our e-mail networks. When you complete our sign up form, you will receive various e-mail updates and bulletins that we send out on a periodic basis containing selected articles and other information, with hyperlinks to our Site;
sign up for our media list to receive press releases or alerts to items you indicate are of interest including special media events;
report a violation or request legal help;
send correspondence to a friend, to your government representative or to other targeted representatives through the Site;
participate in one of our online petitions or surveys;
or participate in any activity that requires your voluntarily submitted data.
In addition, if you contact us directly, we may keep a record of your correspondence, including any personal information contained therein.
A request for service, support or information may be forwarded to third parties not affiliated with The Center as needed to respond to the request.
Correspondence sent for inclusion in our newsletter or other publications may be so used (as submitted or as edited by us in our sole discretion), including related personal information (such as your name), unless you request confidentiality in that regard.
Wherever we collect personal information from you on the Site, we will ensure that a link from that Site page is linked to this Privacy Policy.
We make every effort to maintain the accuracy and completeness of your personal data which we store and to ensure all of your personal data is up to date. However, you can assist us with this considerably by promptly contacting us if there are any changes to your personal data, or if you become aware that we have inaccurate personal data relating to you. We will not be responsible for any losses arising from any inaccurate, inauthentic, deficient or incomplete personal data that you provide to us.
Tracking Data
Tracking data consists of information we collect automatically from each Site visitor, such as their browser type, operating system, Internet service provider or referring site through cookies and other means. Tracking data includes aggregate information, such as the total number of Site or page visits, and the average time spent on individual pages on the Site.
Basis for Processing Data
By " processing, " we mean the collection, recording, storage, use, disclosure and any other form of operations or dealings with your personal information.
We will only process your personal information, where:
you have given your consent to such processing (which you may withdraw at any time, as detailed below);
the processing is necessary to provide our services through the Site;
the processing is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations; and/or
the processing is necessary for our legitimate interests or those of any third party recipients that receive your personal data (as detailed below).
We use tracking data for a variety of purposes, including, for example, for load balancing metrics and to create reports on visitor demographics and Site traffic patterns. The reports that are generated from tracking data are used for a variety of purposes, including, for example, to improve the Site or to seek funding.
How we use Personal Information
We will process your personal information in connection with the management of our relationship with you for the following purposes:
to contact you where we have received your consent to do so;
for monitoring and assessing compliance with our policies and standards;
for promotional and marketing materials and activities, including photos and videos;
to carry outÂ financial and credit checks and for fraud and crime prevention and detection purposes;
for administrative purposes in relation to the security and access of our systems, premises, platforms and secured websites and applications;
to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations and requests anywhere in the world, including reporting to and/or being audited by national and international regulatory bodies;
to comply with court orders and exercise and/or defend our legal rights;
for any other legitimate business purpose; and
as otherwise permitted or required by any applicable law or regulation.
We may also, from time to time, combine your voluntarily submitted personal data with some publicly available data collected from third parties to improve our services to you and for our own internal marketing, communications and fundraising purposes.
Provided that you have consented as provided below, The Center may send you, by postal mail or e-mail, solicitations to support The Center or particular organizations or causes.
International Transfers of Personal Information
If you are located outside of the United States, information you provide to us and the tracking data we collect will be transferred to the United States, where levels of data of protection may differ from that of your own jurisdiction.
If you are a data subject in the European Union, we will ensure that any such international transfers are made subject to appropriate or suitable safeguards as required by the GDPR. Copies of the relevant safeguard documents are available at 199 Water St., New York, NY 10038 and can be provided by request.
By accessing our Site and by submitting your personal information, you consent to its transferand storage in the United States and its use by us as provided for herein.
Third-Party Sharing
We work with third parties who provide services such as website hosting, order processing and fulfillment, credit card clearance, data analysis, e-mailing and other, often administrative services. We may provide such third parties with visitors' personal information and tracking data. We limit such service providers to using personal information, including financial information, that is shared with them solely for the purpose of providing such services and in full confidentiality.
Third-Party Functionality
Our Site contains links to other websites operated by third parties. For example, when you make online donations to us or request one of our print publications be mailed rather than downloading or printing the electronic version of that publication, you will link to a third-party website through our Site. Such third parties may collect information about you, through cookies or other technologies, when you link to their websites through our Site. We recommend that you review the privacy policies of such third parties to understand how they collect and use information.
Cookies
We collect some data through the use of cookies to track website usage as mentioned above. As also noted, certain services provided in connection with the Site, such as the e-mail signups, online donations or the online store, are handled by third parties that may or may not use cookies or other similar tracking technologies. Although we have chosen vendors with a reputation for security, The Center cannot control the personal information collected by those vendors and ask that you become familiar with their privacy policies.
Consent
You may consent to receiving solicitations from us, and to having us disclose your personal information to like-minded organizations for purposes of contacting you regarding such organizations. You may do this whenever you provide us with personal information by checking the appropriate check box(es) on the applicable online form. If you subsequently desire to withdraw your consent of receiving solicitations from us, and from having us disclose your personal information to like-minded organizations, you may do so by sending a request by e-mail to dataprivacy@reprorights.org or by postal mail to the address provided under "Contact Information" below.
To understand how your information shared with like-minded organizations is treated, we recommend that you contact directly the relevant third party.
Other Communications
From time to time, in order to best serve our community, we may e-mail Site visitors information regarding important developments affecting reproductive rights. We may also e-mail Site visitors on occasion regarding the Site and Site-related services. Such information may be sent to Site visitors only if they have consented to receiving such information.
How Long We Hold Your Personal Information

Compliance with Laws
We reserve the right to disclose any information including personal information in our possession or that of the third parties with whom we contract to perform services on our behalf in compliance with any law, regulation, decree, judgment, order, subpoena or any other governmental order ("Order") without any obligation to contest such Order.
