How we protect your personal information
We have implemented technical, physical and administrative safeguards designed to protect personal information against loss, theft or unauthorized or unlawful access, use, disclosure, alteration or destruction.
All passwords are stored on our server in encrypted form. If you lose your password, we will generate a new one and send it to you.
We have personal information retention processes designed to retain personal information for no longer than necessary for the purposes stated above or to otherwise meet legal requirements.
Other data we collect that is not personally identifiable
We collect information regarding your use of the Site, such as computer-related information (browser type you used, your Internet Protocol address, last URL visited, and the date and time of day of your login). We send a "cookie" or "pixel tag" to your computer which contains an identification number that is unique to the computer you are using. You may decline to provide personal information to us and/or refuse cookies in your browser, although some of our features or services may not function properly as a result, and some services may not be available. We use this information to enhance the experience of using the Site, to tailor our Site for you and other future visitors, to understand how our Site is used, to investigate and verify proper conduct at the Site, and to monitor the security and integrity of the Site.
We may also use third parties to serve our advertisements on other websites. These companies may use tracer tags or web beacons to report certain information (but not your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number) about your visits to our Site and the websites which advertise and feature links to our Site, in order to measure the effectiveness of our advertisements.
We use data in the aggregate for our business purposes, but we do not use it in a manner that allows identification of an individual user.

These links are not intended as an endorsement of or referral to the linked websites. The linked websites have separate and independent privacy statements, notices and terms of use, which we recommend you read carefully. We do not have any control over such websites, and therefore we have no responsibility or liability for the manner in which the organizations that operate such linked websites may collect, use or disclose, secure and otherwise treat your personal information.
