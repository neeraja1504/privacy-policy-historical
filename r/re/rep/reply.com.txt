Cookie Policy
The Reply website (hereinafter referred to as the "Website") uses Cookies to make its services
simple and effective for users visiting the portal page.
Cookies are text files, or parcels of information sent from a web server (the website www.reply.com)
to the user's browser, which are memorised on the computer and automatically returned to the server
every time the website is accessed.
There are various types of Cookie, some used to make using the Website more efficient, others to
enable certain functions. For example, Cookies can:
•  memorise entered preferences;
•  prevent users from having to re-enter the same information several times during their visit,
for example username and password;
•  analyse use of the services and contents provided by the website visited in order to optimise
the browsing experience and services offered;
•  allow visitors of the Reply websites to be recognized by third parties (Google, Facebook,
LinkedIn) during the navigation on third-party platforms and be informed about Reply
initiatives possibly promoted on these platforms;
•  carry out anonymous statistical analysis.
Types of Cookies used by the Reply website
The types of Cookies used by the Reply website are listed below, grouped according to their reasons
for use.
Technical Cookies
This type of Cookie allows certain sections of the Website to function correctly and are essential in
order to allow the user to browse the Website and use its features. There are two categories of
technical cookies:
•  persistent: once the browser has been closed these are not cancelled, but last until a pre-
defined expiry date;
•  session: these are automatically cancelled each time the browser is closed.
These Cookies, always sent by the "reply.com" domain, are necessary for the correct visualisation
of the Website and, in relation to the technical services offered, will therefore always be used and
sent (unless the user modifies the settings in his or her browser). Included in this category are the
persistent Cookies used to allow the user to register with the Website and access its restricted area.
The aforementioned Cookies used by the Website avoid the need to use other data processing
techniques which could potentially reduce the confidentiality of the users' navigation of the website,
and do not permit the acquisition of identifying personal information regarding the user.
Functionality Cookies
The Cookies in this category are used to memorise certain settings selected by the user, in order to
remember their preferences during future visits.

Last update: 15/07/2019

the "reply.com" domain. They may also be used when providing a service not explicitly requested
by, but provided to the user.
The information gathered by these cookies is anonymous and cannot track the user's behaviour on
other websites.
Included in this category, for example, are first-party Cookies used to memorise the user's
preferences regarding the country of origin and therefore the language in which the text of the
Website is viewed.
Performance Cookies

of the website by the user and the number of accesses to the website, in order to manage the
performance and structure of the website. These cookies are generally persistent.

This type of Cookie integrates functions developed by third parties into the pages of the Website
such as icons and preferences expressed on social networks (for example: Facebook, Twitter) in
order to share the contents of the Website or for the use of third party software services (such as
software to generate maps and other software offering additional services). These Cookies are sent
by third party domains and partner websites, which therefore offer their features within the pages of
the Website.
