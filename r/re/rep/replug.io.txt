1. Introduction
This Privacy Policy describes how and when we collect, use, and share your information across our websites, APIs, email notifications, applications and our other covered services that link to this Policy (collectively, the “Services”) and from our white label partners and other third parties.
For example, you send us information when you use our Services on the web, via our API, or from our mobile apps. When using any of our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, storage, disclosure, and use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. This includes any information you choose to provide that is deemed sensitive under applicable law.
Your information is controlled by Replug, a product of Replug Inc, Regeringsgatan 65, 111 56, Stockholm, Sweden. However, you alone control and are responsible for any content you submit, create or post through the Services, as provided in the Terms of Service. Replug is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy regarding all information that might be collected while using any of our Services.
When this policy mentions “we” or “us,” it refers to the processor of your information under this policy. We collect personal information with consent, when appropriate or required, and by lawful means only.
Irrespective of which country you live in, you authorize us to transfer, store, and use your information in any country where we operate.  If there is a case when personal data is transferred from the EU to the United States, it is solely for the purpose of processing as per instructions from the controller.
If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, please submit a request through our form, available at https://replug.io/contact.

4.1. Provide, improve and develop Services
We are able to deliver our Services, support your usage of our products and introduce improvements by using this information to understand how you use and interact with our Services.
When we have location information, we use it to tailor our Services for you and others, like automatically detecting your location in order to support your ability to schedule messages in your own time zone.
We conduct surveys and research, test features in development, and analyze the information we have to evaluate and improve products and services, develop new products or features, and conduct audits and troubleshooting activities.
4.2. Communicate with you
We use your information to send you marketing communications, communicate with you about our Services and let you know about our policies and terms. We also use your information to respond to you when you contact us.
5. Information we receive from other sources
We may receive information about you if you use any of the Services we provide. We inform you when we collect any data that it may be shared internally and combined with other data collected on our Services. For example, when you connect your Facebook account to Replug, you will be able to opt in to the data that Replug is able to collect from Facebook on your behalf.
We may also receive private information about your business profiles from the social network profiles you connect to Replug including Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Google+, Tumblr, and Instagram.
We may also access data from your Google Analytics account in real time when you authorize this from our reporting area.
On all occasions where we receive data from a platform with whom our Services integrate, you will be informed of the data that will be collected by our Services and will need to give consent to have Replug receive and process your personal data from these platforms on your behalf.
We work closely with other third parties (including, for example, business partners, sub-contractors in technical, payment and delivery services, advertising networks, analytics providers, search information providers, credit reference agencies) and may receive information about you from them. The information we receive is used to enhance your experience with our Services.
6. Information we share and disclose
We do not sell or trade your personally identiﬁable information. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our Services, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information conﬁdential and are compliant with GDPR.
We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others rights, property, or safety.
Non-personally identiﬁable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.
6.1 Sharing you control
We share or disclose your personal data with your consent or at your direction, such as when you authorize a social network or third party application to access your account or when you direct us to share your feedback with a business.
When you share content via your Replug account to a third-party service, keep in mind that you are controlling the flow of this content from our platform through to the third-party service.
When you add a team member or client to your account, you may choose to share personal data with them. For example, you may choose to share a client’s analytics report with a team member. By acting as data controller, Replug provides you with all the tools and settings you need to be able to control the flow of data.
Subject to your settings, we also provide certain third parties with personal data to help us offer or operate our Services.
6.2 Service providers and advertisers
We engage service providers to perform functions and provide services to us in the United States, UK, and other countries. For example, we use a variety of third-party services to help operate our services, such as hosting our various blogs and websites, and to help us understand the use of our services, such as Google Analytics.
We may share your private personal data with such service providers subject to obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures, and on the condition that the third parties use your private personal data only on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions.
We share your payment information with payment services providers to process payments; prevent, detect, and investigate fraud or other prohibited activities; facilitate dispute resolution such as chargebacks or refunds; and for other purposes associated with the acceptance of credit and debit cards.
We may share your information with advertisers and advertising networks that require the data to select and serve relevant adverts to you and others.  We may make use of the personal data we have collected from you to enable us to display relevant advertisements to you on third party websites. For example, if we’ve noticed that you’ve been actively using our reporting features, we may use this data to show you relevant advertisements on Facebook informing you of a new analytics feature we’ve launched.
6.3 Affiliates and change of ownership
In the event that we are involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of assets, your personal data may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. This Privacy Policy will apply to your personal data as transferred to the new entity.
We may also disclose personal data about you to our affiliates in order to help operate our services and our affiliates’ services. This information is limited to your email address, browsing behavior and any other actions you’ve taken on our website before becoming a customer.
7. Where we store and transfer your personal data
The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). It may also be processed by employees or contractors operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, processing your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing.
We take the protection of your data very seriously and have made every effort to be compliant with  General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which is a “regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy for all individuals within the European Union and the EEA region.” The GDPR replaces the 1995 Data Protection Directive  . We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.
All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers located in the US and certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using TLS technology and processed via our payment gateway, FastSpring. We do not store any credit cards in our system. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password(s) with anyone. We also provide additional security controls within Replug, allowing you to restrict access to specific IP addresses.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information on the Internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our Services, and any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access.
