Privacy Policy - Computer Repair Shop Software – CRM & Invoice System
Last Updated: April 11, 2014
Preface
This privacy policy ("Policy") applies to the Service operated by Servably, Inc. ("RepairShopr" "we" or "us") with mobile applications and a website located at www.RepairShopr.com (the "Service"). The Policy is designed to tell you how we collect and use personally identifying information (“PII”) (as defined below) so you can make an informed decision about using our Service. Please read this statement before using our Service or submitting any PII to us. By using our Service, you represent that you are 14 years old or older and you consent to the information collection and use practices described herein. We reserve the right to change the provisions of this privacy policy at any time by posting a revised privacy policy on the Site and indicating on the privacy policy the date it was last updated. Your use of the Service following the posting of such changes or revised statement shall constitute your acceptance of any such changes. We encourage you to review our privacy policy whenever you use our Service to determine if any changes have been made and to make sure that you understand how any PII you provide will be used.
What is “PII”?
As used herein, the term "PII" generally means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as user's name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card or other account number or geophysical location) or that is associated with an identifiable person (such as demographic information or information about a person's activities when such information is linked to personally identifying information). PII does not include "aggregate" information, which is data we collect about the use of the Service or categories of Service users, from which any PII has been removed. For example, information that forty-six percent of the Service's registered users identify themselves as male, is aggregate information. We collect aggregate data for a number of purposes, including to help us understand trends and user needs. This policy in no way limits or restricts our collection of aggregate information.
What PII do we collect?
We do not collect any PII from mere visitors to the Site or Service. Your email address may be collected when you send us an email. If you register (as defined in the RepairShopr User Access and License Agreement), we will collect your email address, name, organization information, address and credit card and/or other account information and possibly photos.
What other information do we collect?
When you visit our Site, some information is also automatically collected through the use of log files, such as your computer's Internet Protocol (IP) address, your computer's operating system, the browser type, the address of a referring web Service and your activity on the Service. We use this information for purposes such as analyzing trends, administering the Service, improving customer service, diagnosing problems with our servers, tracking user movement, and gathering broad demographic information for aggregate use. We may also automatically collect certain information through the use of "cookies." Cookies are small data files that are stored on a user's hard drive at the request of a Web Service to enable the Service to recognize users who have previously visited them and retain certain information such as customer preferences and history. If we combine cookies with or link them to any of the PII, we would treat this information as PII. If you wish to block, erase, or be warned of cookies, please refer to your browser instructions or help screen to learn about these functions. However, if your browser is set not to accept cookies or if a user rejects a cookie, you will not be able to sign in to your RepairShopr account and will not be able to access certain Service features or Services.
We may also use third parties to provide certain functionalities or to collect, track and analyze non-personally identifiable usage and statistical information from users, such as the user's browser type, operating system, browsing behavior and demographic information. These third parties may collect PII from you in connection with the Services they provide and may place cookies, web beacons or other devices on your computer to collect nonpersonal information which may be used, among other things, to deliver advertising targeted to your interests and to better understand the usage and visitation of our Service and the other Services tracked by these third parties. We are not responsible for, and do not control, any actions or policies of any third party service providers.
Usage and disclosure
We do not sell information to third parties. RepairShopr only uses your PII to send you the communications noted below and as necessary to provide the Services, as described below.
PII may be used in one or more of the following ways:
To publicly display information in a manner selected by our customers to their customers.
To register a customer and process payments. Credit card processing is performed by a PCI compliant third party processor and such information is not processed or retained by RepairShopr.
To have a record of who posted content to the Service.
To send periodic emails: The email address you provide may be used to send you information and updates pertaining to the Services, and, if you do not “opt out”, to send you occasional company news, updates, or related product or service information.
We do not sell, share, or rent any PII to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this Policy without first obtaining your consent, although we may provide aggregate information or other nonpersonal information to third parties without your authorization. We may share your contact information with third parties if you have indicated to us that you wish to receive information from such parties. In the event that we engage or partner with third party vendors, consultants or other service providers in connection with the operation of our business ("Service Providers"), we may share PII with such Service Providers who need access to such information to carry out their work for us. You should also note that information that you provide to us for posting to the Service will be posted for display in the manner you select. Your posting of such information to our Service constitutes your consent to display such information in such manner. We also may disclose personal information when we are required to or we believe it is appropriate to comply with the law (e.g., a lawful subpoena, warrant or court order); to enforce or apply this privacy policy or our other policies or agreements; to initiate, render, bill, and collect for amounts owed to us; to protect our or our customers' rights, property or safety; to protect our customers from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of our Service or Service; or if we believe that an emergency involving the danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires disclosure of communications or justifies disclosure of personal information. In addition, information about our customers, including personal information, may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of RepairShopr assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which personally identifiable information could be transferred to third parties as one of the business assets of the RepairShopr.
Please note: The Service may contain links to other Services. Please be aware that although we may participate in or utilize such other Services, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other Services. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our Service and to read the privacy policies of any Web Service that collects personally identifiable information. Similarly, if you entered this Service through another Web Service, we are also not responsible for the privacy practices of that Service, and you should review the privacy policy of the originating Service before providing any personal information to that Service. This privacy policy applies solely to information collected by us.
Google. Our Services use Google Analytics to help analyze how users use the Services. The tool uses "cookies," which are text files placed on mobile device, to collect standard Internet log information and visitor behavior information in an anonymous form. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the Services (including IP address) is transmitted to Google. This information is then used to evaluate visitors' use of the Services and to compile statistical reports for RepairShopr.
What steps do we take to protect your information online?
RepairShopr endeavors to secure your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure by putting into place physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect through this Service. Credit card information is encrypted during transmission and payment processing is performed by a PCI compliant third party processor and such information is not processed or retained by RepairShopr. Other account information is accessible online only through the use of a password and data fields calling for personally identifying information are encrypted when in storage and in transmission. Please be aware, however, that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. To protect the confidentiality of your personal information, you must keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person. You are responsible for all uses of the Service by any person using your password. Please advise us immediately by emailing us at help@repairshopr.com if you believe your password has been misused. You should also note that email is not secure, and you should not send any confidential or sensitive information to us via an unsecured email.
