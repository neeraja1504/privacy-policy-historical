PRIVACY STATEMENT
Overview
The following guidelines represent the Republican American’s information gathering and dissemination practices for this Website. By using this Website, you acknowledge and agree to the terms and conditions set forth in this Privacy Statement. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Statement, please do not use this Website.
Information that we collect
We may request that you supply us with personal information during a “registration” process prior to using certain features and services offered on our Website. Personal information requested may include, but is not limited to, your name; mailing address; phone numbers; email address; and demographic information.
Transactions and e-commerce on our site
While the majority of our websites are offered free of charge, we do charge fees for select products and services. When a fee is required, you must supply personal information, including your billing address, phone number and credit card information in order to purchase that particular product or service.
For example, you may elect to purchase a subscription to the online e-edition of the Newspaper, place an online advertisement with our For Sale By Owner (FSBO) feature, submit a photo order online, or purchase other tangible goods or services. To serve you most efficiently, credit card transactions and order fulfillment are often handled by a third party processing agent, bank or distribution institution.
While in most cases transactions are completed without difficulty, there is no such thing as “perfect security” on the Internet or offline. If you are concerned about online credit card safety, in most cases a telephone number will be made available so you can call and place your order by phone.
Under no circumstances is the Republican American or www.rep-am.com responsible for the success or security of transactions undertaken or processed by third parties.
How is my information used?
We use information collected from server log files, such as IP addresses, to help diagnose problems with our services, to administer our Website, and to report and gather aggregate information about site usage and user demographics. The aggregated data may be shared with advertisers or business partners.
Cookies are used to store and sometimes track information about you. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web service and stored on your computer’s hard drive . Cookies are used to deliver targeted advertising based on your behavior or demographics and to track your number of entries in some of our promotions and contests. 3rd parties may be placing and reading cookies on end users’ browsers, or using web beacons or similar technologies to collect information in the course of tasks being served on site. You can set your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do, we will not be able to customize the Website’s features according to your preferences. Advertising networks that serve ads into our site may also use their own cookies.
Security of information
We use our best efforts to ensure the security of personal information submitted by our users. When we collect personal information from our users, it is stored in an area where the general public does not have access to it.
We have adopted a set of information management guidelines that serve as the basis for our customer and advertiser relationships. These guidelines have been developed with the recognition that Internet technologies are rapidly evolving, and that underlying business models are still not established. Accordingly, these guidelines are subject to change. Any such changes will be posted on this page and shall supersede any preexisting guidelines as of the date of posting.
If the changes represent a material departure from our current practices with respect to the use of personal information, registered users will be notified via e-mail.
Information sharing
If you voluntarily transfer personal information in order to access certain services and features on this Website, you are sharing that information with the Newspaper, its affiliated companies and at the discretion of the Newspaper, certain third parties.
The Newspaper will only share your personal information with third parties if (1) sharing such information is necessary to complete an online transaction, and/or (2) the third party agrees not to disseminate and use your personal information for any other purpose than the purpose expressly approved by the Newspaper.
If you do not want your personal information to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer by not using that particular service.
Opt-Out contact information
You may choose to Opt-Out of having your personal information shared by contacting the Newspaper, by telephone or by U.S. Mail. If you choose to opt-out, please inform the Republican American that you do not wish to share the personal information you have transferred in connection with your use of certain services and features of this website.
