A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to your browser from a web site's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. Each web site can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. Our site uses cookies to make sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly.  We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit certain sections of our site that require a login for use, such as our advertiser's area.
