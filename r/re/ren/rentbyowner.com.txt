Our commitment to privacy
At RentByOwner.com we know that protecting the privacy and confidentiality of your personal information is important. This Privacy Policy governs the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information in any form, whether written or electronic, by RentByOwner.com and its affiliates. The collection, use and disclosure of your personal information is governed by the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (the "Act"), and any applicable provincial legislation. This Privacy Policy explains what personal information may be collected from you and how it is used. It also explains how you can ask questions, make suggestions, and express concerns about our privacy practices.
This Privacy Policy applies only to personal information collected by RentByOwner.com and its affiliates. Be aware that our website contains links to other websites that are maintained by third parties who are not required to comply with this Privacy Policy and for which RentByOwner.com has no responsibility. Please review the privacy policies on any external websites to determine their information handling practices.
By submitting your personal information to RentByOwner.com or using the site, you signify your agreement to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.
What personal information do we collect, and why?
We collect personal contact information (including, but not limited to, your name, address, email address and telephone number) if you supply it to us. This information is used to fulfill your request for information, products or services, to provide targeted advertising, and to respond to your inquiries.
We will retain your subscriber ID and passwords (if you create any) so that upon request by you we may remind you of them. If you enter a contest or other promotion, we use your personal contact information to administer the contest or promotion including contacting, announcing and promoting prizewinners. In addition, sometimes our contest rules provide that we may contact contest entrants with promotions and product information. Those rules will also include a way for you to indicate to us that you do not want to be contacted for this purpose. Some contests may also involve co-sponsors, who have their own privacy practices. In these cases, the contest rules and/or entry forms will indicate that your personal information is being shared with these co-sponsors and will provide you with the ability to opt-out from receiving promotions and product information from them.
We collect demographic information, as well as interaction data in order to gain a better understanding of your interests so that we may develop better products and services, and to determine your eligibility for other products and services. If you choose to opt-out of any use of your personal information in accordance with our opt-out policy, we will keep your contact information on a list so that your request can be honoured. If you provide a complaint to any of our departments, we will collect your contact information and the nature of your complaint, for the purpose of investigating your concerns and responding to you.
