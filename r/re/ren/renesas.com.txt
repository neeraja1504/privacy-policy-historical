Use of Cookies and Web Beacons
A “cookie” is a small data file that a web site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your system. We use cookies to better serve you when you return to our web site. Some of our web pages may send cookies when you visit our web site, make purchases, respond to online surveys or promotions, participate in a contest, or request information. Accepting the cookies used on our web site enables our web server to identify your system by reading the cookie that has been stored on your system, but our web server cannot identify you unless you enter your Personal Information. Cookies that are placed when visiting our site cannot be used to obtain your Personal Information at another site.  Cookies also enable you to register and login to different portions of our website, and our related web sites, that require a username and password.  For your convenience, Renesas’ global web sites utilize “single sign-on” functionality.  This means that if you login to one of Renesas’ web sites, you will automatically be logged in to Renesas’ other web sites.
The information collected online permits us to analyze traffic patterns on our web site and is used on an anonymized basis. This can enable us over time to provide users with a better experience on our web site by improving the content and making it easier to use.  The information collected online also allows us to contact you (but only to the extent permitted by applicable law), regarding our products and services that may be responsive to your needs or browsing history.
Depending on the browser used, you can set your browser to notify you before you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it, and you can also set your browser to turn off cookies. However, if you do so, some areas of this web site may not function properly, or you will be required to re-enter your Personal Information to use an area of this web site.
We may also use web beacon technologies to better tailor the web site to provide better customer service. A web beacon is a single pixel GIF that allows a web site to count users who have visited that page or access certain cookies. These web beacons may be placed on specific pages across this web site. When a visitor accesses these pages, an anonymous notice of that visit is generated which may be processed by us or by our vendors. These web beacons work in conjunction with cookies. If you don’t want to associate your anonymous cookie information with your visits to these pages, depending on the browser used, you can set your browser to turn off cookies.
