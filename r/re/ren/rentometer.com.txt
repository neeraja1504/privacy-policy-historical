A subscribing User may edit the User's own information stored in the User's portfolios at any time by logging in with his or her Login Name and Password. IIC strongly urges subscribing Users to not divulge their Login Name and Password to anyone, and to not enable any login storage feature of any web browser or software program, which would permit anyone with access to the subscriber's computer to have access to the subscriber's personal RentometerPro account. IIC also urges Users to completely close their web browser window when they have finished visiting the Pro.rentometer.com web site. This is to ensure that others cannot easily access personal information if the computer is shared or is used at a public place. Subscriber credit card and payment information is not stored in a database or on any servers connected to the Internet. This is to provide the best protection of subscriber payment information. Credit card data transmission in the subscription process is encrypted using SSL or other encryption techniques. IIC has physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in place, including an Information Security Policy, to protect personal information provided to IIC or stored in Pro.rentometer.com from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, alteration and destruction. Although there cannot be a guaranty of the security of personal information provided by Users to IIC or stored in Pro.rentometer.com, IIC believes that its security policies and safeguards are reasonable and appropriate to adequately protect such information, regardless of the format in which such information is held. IIC intends to review and update its security policies and safeguards on a regular basis. IIC requires that its employees keep all personal information confidential and comply with its Information Security Policy and privacy practices. IIC uses reasonable efforts to ensure that upon disposal or destruction of personal information, confidentiality of the information is maintained.
