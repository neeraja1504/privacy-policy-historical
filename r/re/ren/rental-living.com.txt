When you register to request information on a Website or Application or make purchases on a Website or Application, for example, you submit personal information. Once you use these features of the Website or Application, you are not anonymous to us.
Irvine also may acquire personal information from publicly available sources, social media platforms, and vendors and other third parties that may share information as permitted in their privacy policies.
Irvine may combine personal information collected as described above with information available from other sources (such as other platforms, Service Providers, analytics services, offline records or publicly available information). If the combined information, or any other non-personal information that Irvine collects about you, is maintained, used or shared in a manner that associates it with your name, contact information (online or offline), we will treat such information as personal information.
B. NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION
Non-personal information refers to data and information that does not personally identify you as the individual to whom the data or information relates, which may include data and information that (i) is aggregated (that is, relates to a group of individuals) by Irvine or a third party (“aggregated non-personal information”), or (ii) is not linked to personal contact information (“de-identified non-personal information”). In either case, non-personal information does not personally identify the individual to whom the information or data collected relates. Non-personal information may include, without limitation, your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, your media access control (MAC) address, Collection Technology information (as described below), the pages you request, type of computer or device you use, the operating system you use (e.g., Microsoft Windows, Mac OS, Google Chrome OS, iOS or Android), the type of browser you use (e.g., Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer or Safari), the domain name of the Internet service provider, your activities while visiting or using the Websites or Applications and the content you access or view, the time of your visit to or use of the Websites or Applications, the pages you visit and the time spent on the pages, your general geographic location such as the city from which your computer or device is connecting to the Internet, your computer’s or device’s precise geographic location when Wi-Fi is enabled and it is within range of or using Internet connectivity made available by Irvine, information regarding the websites you visit prior to and after visiting the Websites or using the Applications, information regarding your Internet location when you see Irvine’s ads and whether you click on such ads, information regarding your age, gender and interests with respect to products and services and information collected through our security systems and cameras.

(“Google”) and the operators of other websites or applications that you have visited or used, some of which partner with Irvine or with a display network or analytics service utilized by Irvine, and may share information as permitted in such third party’s privacy policy. Non-personal information may also be obtained from inferences based upon the sites you visit, third party data, information you share on other websites, social media platforms and applications, or demographics derived from profiles you create, such as a Google profile.
i. Cookies and other “Collection Technology”
Non-personal information may be collected in a variety of ways, but Collection Technology is often used. “Collection Technology” refers to cookies, web beacons, pixels, gifs, tags and other technologies that collect information in similar ways. Collection Technology such as a cookie may store a piece of data on your browser or device, while other forms of Collection Technology may identify your browser or device and/or collect information through other means. When you visit the Websites or use the Applications or visit another website or application your browser or device may be exposed to Collection Technology and Collection Technology may be stored on your browser or device. Irvine may come to acquire non-personal information about you upon collection of the non-personal information or some time thereafter.
You may delete and/or refuse the use of certain Collection Technologies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser. You may use the Websites or Applications even if you choose to refuse or delete such Collection Technologies; however please note that this may affect your ability to use the full functionality of the Websites or Applications, and may impact our ability to customize the Websites or Applications for you.

The Websites or Applications may use analytics services provided by third parties, such as the analytics services of Adobe Marketing Cloud and Google Analytics, among others. These analytics services use Collection Technology to collect and store information about you and your use of the Websites and Applications, which may include the personal and non-personal information described above.
You can read the privacy policy that governs Adobe Marketing Cloud services at http://www.adobe.com/privacy/marketing-cloud.html; additional information regarding Adobe Systems Incorporated’s privacy practices can be found at http://www.adobe.com/privacy.html.

Analytics services also may offer certain advertising features, which the Websites or Applications may utilize. For example, the Websites or Applications may use these advertising features of Google Analytics:
