We reserve the right to use and disclose in any manner, any non-personal, non-identifiable information, including in the form of aggregated data, that we collect by use of cookies and traffic data, or that you share with us through the Sites.
In addition, we may provide or share some or all of your personal information, including name and email addresses, to:

Third parties offering products or services that may be relevant to you, whose services you agree to use (e.g., online rent payment services), you have expressed an interest in or initiated contact with (e.g., through a property contact form), or with whom you have authorized us to share your personal information.
Service providers under contract who help with our business operations (such as fraud investigations, bill collection, invoicing, telecommunication and call monitoring services).
Another business entity should we plan to merge with, or sell substantially all our assets to that business entity.
Logs, recordings, and other information related to communication between you and third parties in connection with the services and/or other uses and purposes mentioned herein may be stored, maintained and/or divulged to those third parties by us on an individual basis or in the aggregate.
When you contact a property, they will store information about you, such as your name, email address, phone number, etc. We expect properties to use your information solely for the purpose of your interaction with them as a renter; however, we have no control over how a given property will use your information.
5. Communications and Communication Tools.
We communicate with users, and facilitate communications between users, in a variety of ways, including but not limited to:
Property Contact Forms.
We make tools available that facilitate communications between renters and properties by phone, email or text. When these tools are used, we may collect certain information related to the communication, like email addresses, contact logs, calling number, call duration, contents of the email communication, and call recordings. We may share this information with properties so they can manage their communications with renters.
Email preferences.
We provide all users with the opportunity to opt out of receiving non-essential (promotional, marketing-related) communications from us. To remove your contact information from Rentals.com lists and newsletters, click on the "unsubscribe" link that is included at the bottom of any Rentals.com email you receive.
6. Cookies.
We or our service providers may place cookies or web beacons on your device when you visit our Sites. We use permanent cookies to provide personalized features, such as automatically logging you into your personalized home page and to deliver customized services, content, and advertising. We use session cookies to monitor and improve the functionality and usability of the Sites. You can block our cookies by changing the settings on your browser (contact your ISP for help), but doing so may prevent us from delivering certain services to you.
We may use data management platforms and third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our and our advertising partners’ behalf. These companies may employ cookies, clear gifs, web beacons or similar technologies to deliver advertising and measure its effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and web beacons is completely anonymous.
7. Opting Out of Collection of Information by our Service Providers.
As noted above, we or our service providers (e.g., data management platforms, third-party ad servers, ad network providers, or third-party advertisers) may provide you with advertisements that you see on the Sites or other websites. To help deliver these advertisements and improve the overall consumer experience, we or our service providers may employ cookies, clear gifs, web beacons or similar technologies. These technologies may record your activity, and are helpful to understand what types of information or advertisements are most useful for a user. To learn more about your ability to opt out of certain of these technologies and for other information, please visit, the Digital Advertising Alliance and the Network Advertising Initiative.
8. Renters, Properties, External Website and Other Third Parties.
Except as otherwise expressly included herein, this Privacy Policy addresses only the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. If you disclose your information to others, whether they are renters, properties or other websites, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them. We do not control the privacy policies of third parties. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.
The Sites have links to other websites that may collect personal information about you. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those linked websites.
9. Security.
Your information (other than credit card or bank account information) is stored on our servers located in the United States. We treat data as an asset that must be protected and use many tools (encryption, passwords, physical security, etc.) to protect your personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure. However, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, and other users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect from Rentals.com. Therefore, although we work very hard to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private.

The Sites are intended solely for use by persons 13 years of age or older. If you are under the age of 13, you may not use the Sites or other services, or contribute any information to us.
