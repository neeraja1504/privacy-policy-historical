Remote Year Privacy Policy | Remote Year
Remote Year, Inc. its subsidiaries and other entities within its corporate group structure (collectively, “ we ”, “ us ”, “ our ” or “ Remote Year ”) respect the privacy of our users and we are committed to informing you about how we collect, use, and share Personal Information about you which is submitted by you or on your behalf. This Privacy Policy describes our practices with respect to the information we collect from or about our users in connection with the Remote Year website, portal, and/or mobile application (collectively, the “ Remote Year Platform ”) and Services (as defined in the Participant Terms and Conditions). This Privacy Policy applies to persons anywhere in the world who use the Remote Year Platform or Services. For clarity, Services includes the Remote Year Platform..
Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand how we will treat your Personal Information (as defined below) and by continuing to browse the website or purchase or use any of our services you are deemed to have accepted the terms of this Privacy Policy.
In addition, we recommend that you review our Privacy Policy periodically, because we may revise it at any time. We are constantly trying to improve Remote Year, so this Privacy Policy may need to change. We reserve the right to change the Privacy Policy at any time, but if make material changes, we will bring them to your attention by placing a notice on remoteyear.com, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means. The “Effective Date” at the top of this page indicates when our Privacy Policy was last revised.  Each time you use the Remote Year Platform or provide us with information, you accept the practices described in this Privacy Policy as applicable at that time.
Personal Information and Other Information Processed by Remote Year
Remote Year processes both Personal Information and Other Information about its users through their use of and in connection with the Services.  For purposes of this Privacy Policy (i) “ Personal Information ” is information relating to a person who is identified in that data or who is, together with other data, identifiable; and (ii) “ Other Information ” is any additional information that Remote Year collects about our users that is not Personal Information.
Personal Information you provide:  you may give us your Personal Information directly, for example, when you fill in forms on the Remote Year Platform, correspond with us (for example, without limitation, by email, phone, skype, zoom, or chat), register to use the Remote Year Platform, access our mobile applications or services, create an account with us or otherwise use the Remote Year Platform. The Personal Information you give us directly will usually include your name, address, email address, social media details, contact details, emergency contact details, billing information, photos, videos, voice recordings and information about your family and friends. It also includes the information provided in your application forms such as employment history and current employment details, income details, travel plans, personal and professional goals, languages, nationality and residency, passport details, background check and identity check details (including details of any criminal offences), health data, details of personal interests, lifestyle details, sexual orientation, accommodation preferences and insurance details. All information and content submitted by you to the Remote Year Platform may be retained by us indefinitely, even after you terminate your account. We may continue to disclose such content to third parties in a manner that does not reveal Personal Information, as described in this Privacy Policy.
We may use your contact information to send you information about the Services. You may unsubscribe from some of these messages by using the unsubscribe link provided in each email, although, we reserve the right to contact you when we believe it is necessary, such as for account recovery purposes.
Personal Information we collect:  we may combine Personal Information collected through the Remote Year Platform with Other Information that we or third parties collect about you in other contexts—such as our communications with you via email, phone or otherwise or your customer service records and travel details.  Additionally, if you register for or access the Remote Year Platform using a third party service, we may receive Personal Information that you allow such third party service to share with us.  You acknowledge that this information may be personal to you, and by creating an account and providing Personal Information to us, you allow others, including us, to identify you and therefore may not be anonymous.
We will treat all such information, to the extent combined with Personal Information, as Personal Information and protect it in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Other Information we collect:  each time you log onto your account or use the Remote Year Platform, we may, in some cases automatically, collect the following information:
through your device:  we may collect information from or through the device you use to connect to the Remote Year Platform, including, for example, the type of device, the IP address, the approximate location derived from an IP address, the mobile network, the operating system and version, the browser and version or the timezone setting or unique device identifiers.
log information:  we automatically receive and record certain details about your use of the Remote Year Platform, including but not limited to, web traffic data, web logs and communication data, information about your activity on the Remote Year Platform.
other information from other sources:  we work with third parties (including, for example, providers in technical, payment services, advertising networks, analytics providers and search information providers), and we may receive, collect, store, and use information about you from them. We may partner with certain third parties to collect the Other Information and to engage in analysis, auditing, research and reporting or for use in providing online interest-based advertising on our behalf.  These third parties may use web logs or web beacons, and they may set and access cookies or similar technologies on your device.  They may also use information about your use of the Remote Year Platform to help target non-Remote Year advertisements based on your online activity in general. Additionally our website is hosted by Webflow.
information from email communications: we may communicate with you via email, SMS, MMS or other text message (collectively, “ Text Message ”) or push notifications (to the extent you permit us to do so), and we may collect information regarding such communications, such as confirmation when you open an email. We use this information to improve the Services, including without limitation our customer service.
financial information: financial information, such as your payment method, valid credit card number, type, expiration date or other financial information, is collected and stored by our third party payment processing company (the “ Payment Processor ”), and use and storage of that information is governed by the Payment Processor’s applicable terms of service and privacy policy.  We do not currently store financial information. Presently, we use Stripe as one of our Payment Processors. The processing of payments will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the Payment Processor in addition to these Terms. Stripe’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy can be found at https://stripe.com/us/checkout/legal.
information related to cookies: we collect information through our use of cookies. Please see the section below titled ‘Cookies’ for more information.
information related to advertising and use of beacons: to support and enhance the Services, we may serve advertisements, and also allow third parties advertisements, through the Remote Year Platform. These advertisements are sometimes targeted and served to particular users and may come from third party companies called “ad networks.”  Ad networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms. Advertisements served through the Remote Year Platform may be targeted to users who fit a certain general profile category and may be based on (i) anonymized information inferred from information provided to us by a user, including Personal Information (e.g., gender or age); (ii) Remote Year Platform usage patterns or (iii) user activity on third party services. We do not provide Personal Information to any ad networks for use outside of the Remote Year Platform. To increase the effectiveness of ad delivery, we may deliver a file (known as a “web beacon”) from an ad network to you through the Remote Year Platform. Web beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers. Web beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites. Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network’s servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site. You can opt out of certain types of targeted advertising as further described in the section below titled ‘Your Rights.’
aggregate information: we collect statistical information about how both unregistered and registered users, collectively, use the Remote Year Platform (“ Aggregate Information ”). Some of this information is derived from Personal Information. This statistical information is not Personal Information and cannot be tied back to you, your account or your web browser.
How We Use Your Personal Information
Remote Year may use the information that we collect from you:
to provide services to you:  we use Personal Information to provide our services to you through the Remote Year Platform, Remote Year trips/programs and events, to process and complete payments or transactions and to provide customer support.

We also may use Personal Information to improve the Services.
to contact you:  subject to applicable law, we or our third-party service and business providers may send you communications. Such communications are designed to make your Remote Year experience more efficient and may include, but are not limited to: notifications about the Services (including important news that could affect your relationship with us), communications about our services, promotions and our mobile application features.  These types of communications may also contain commercial messages, such as banner ads and special offers.  By using the Services, you consent to the receipt of such communications and marketing information.
for legal purposes:  we may use and share Personal Information for legal purposes, including as described below in the section titled ‘How We Share Information with Third Parties’ (including the transfer of such Personal Information to third parties in countries outside your country of residence where data protection laws may be less adequate compared to your own country’s data protection laws).
for our business purposes:  we may use Other Information to help us efficiently operate Remote Year and the Remote Year Platform, to count and recognize visitors to the Remote Year Platform, to enable certain features on the Remote Year Platform and for other purposes related to managing our business.
for other purposes:  subject to applicable law, we may use Other Information for additional purposes in connection with the Remote Year Platform, including any purpose for which we may use Personal Information, as described above.
Remote Year may link Other Information with Personal Information. In those circumstances, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information.
How We Share Information with Third Parties
Subject to applicable law, we may share your Personal Information and Other Information:
with partners and other third-party service providers:  to operate Remote Year Services, including processing your transactions and supporting your activities on a Remote Year trip or the Remote Year Platform, we may share your Personal Information with our partners and other service providers. These service providers may provide us with support services such as origination of communications, receipt or support services, customer relationship management services and order fulfillment.
with Remote Year group entities:  we may share your Personal Information or Other Information with our parent company and other subsidiary or sister entities, each of whom will comply with the terms of this Privacy Policy with respect to its use and disclosure of such Personal Information.
with third-parties through their websites:  the Remote Year Platform may enable you to share information directly on or through websites or online services operated by third parties. For example, the Remote Year Platform may contain links to third-party websites. If you choose to browse such websites, you may disclose your Personal Information to those third-party websites. Remote Year is not liable for the content or action of such third-party websites.
user information: some of your activity and information provided on and through the Remote Year Platform may be public (such as your name, profession, and participation in a program). Please remember that if you choose to provide Personal Information using certain public features of the Remote Year Platform, then that information is governed by the privacy settings of those particular features and may be publicly available. Individuals reading such information may use or disclose it to other individuals or entities without our control and without your knowledge, and search engines may index that information. We therefore urge you to think carefully about including any specific information you may deem private in content that you create or information that you submit through the Remote Year Platform. Additionally, profile information including your name and other information you enter may be displayed to other participants to facilitate participant interaction within the Remote Year Platform. We will not directly reveal user email addresses to other participants.
with our agents: we also employ and contract with people and other entities that perform certain tasks on our behalf and who are under our control (our “Agents”). We may need to share Personal Information with our Agents in order to provide products or services to you. Unless we tell you differently, our Agents do not have any right to use Personal Information or other information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. You hereby consent to our sharing of Personal Information with our Agents.
for legal purposes and the protection of others:  we may disclose your Personal Information and Other Information for Remote Year’s legitimate business interests or to comply with applicable law, investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, violations of our terms and conditions and Privacy Policy or to cooperate with regulatory authorities or law enforcement, to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights or defend against legal claims. We also reserve the right to disclose any information to respond to user support requests or protect our rights, property or safety, our users, and the public. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and spam/malware prevention.
pursuant to business transfers: in some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the transferred business assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.
aggregated information:  from time to time, Remote Year may also share anonymized and aggregated information about users of the Services such as by publishing a report or providing information to our business partners on trends in the usage of the Services and demographic of users. We use and share this type of data so that we and our business partners can understand how and how often people use our and their services or websites, which facilitates improving our Services, their services and how our Services interface with their services. In addition, these business partners may share with us non-private, aggregated or otherwise non Personal Information about you that they have independently developed or acquired.
financial information: as stated above, we do not currently collect financial information, as that information is collected and stored by our Payment Processor. However, we may from time to time request and receive some of your financial information from our Payment Processor for the purposes of completing transactions you have initiated through the Remote Year Platform, enrolling you in discount, rebate, and other programs in which you elect to participate, protecting against or identifying possible fraudulent transactions, and otherwise as needed to manage our business.
information we share with your consent: except as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal Information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.

Our Security Precautions
Remote Year uses commercially reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your Personal Information against loss or unauthorized access, use, modification or deletion but no security program can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, Remote Year cannot guarantee the security of any information obtained or processed by Remote Year or its service providers, and you use the Remote Year Platform at your own risk. Our website is scanned on a regular basis for security holes and known vulnerabilities in order to make your visit to our site as safe as possible. We use regular Malware Scanning. Your Personal Information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential.

Opting out of Interest Based Advertising
We use Google and Facebook services to advertise to you. Google, as a third-party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our site. Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to our users based on previous visits to our site and other sites on the Internet. Users may opt-out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google Ad and Content Network privacy policy. We have implemented demographics and Interests Reporting.

Through the Digital Advertising Alliance (“ DAA ”) and Network Advertising Initiative (“ NAI ”), several media and marketing associations have developed an industry self-regulatory program to give consumers a better understanding of and greater control over ads that are customized based on their online behavior across different websites. To make choices about interest-based ads from participating third parties and to opt out of receiving certain cookies and certain trackers, please visit the DAA’s or NAI’s consumer opt out pages, which are located at http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/ or www.aboutads.info/choices or http://youronlinechoices.eu.
Do Not Track
Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” or “DNT” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites, and web applications, and services that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites.  The Remote Year Platform does not currently support the Do Not Track options offered by most major browsers. For more information about DNT signals, visit   http://allaboutdnt.com.
