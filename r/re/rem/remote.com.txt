We may also ask for your credit card details if you purchase paid Services.
You may import your address books, contact lists and/or emails, including first name, last name, email address, company, job title and other Personal Information of your contacts (collectively, “Contact Data”), into the Service. You may choose to activate or deactivate the import feature on your Account at any time. When this feature is activated, your address book, contact list or email is copied to our servers and automatically scanned for relevant Contact Data. For some email services, you may need to provide your username and password for us to access your email to enable this feature. We store the Contact Data and use it to provide the services and help you manage and network with your contacts in connection with the Services as described further below. We use industry-standard security practices for the security of any username and or password you provide us.

Your Submissions.
As a professional profile and networking platform, part of Your Information, including without limitation content of your profile, is published to the public Internet and visible to unregistered visitors to the Site.  This public profile will be indexed and displayed through public search engines when someone searches for your name.  Further, nothing shall restrict our right to use, access, process, collect, disclose, share or distribute any Public Data, even if such Public Data is duplicative of your Contact Data.
Any information you choose to provide in a comment or a submission on the Site or the Services will be publicly available and should reflect how much you want other users to know about you. We recommend that you guard your anonymity and sensitive information and we encourage you to think carefully about what information about yourself you disclose in your comments or submissions. If you disclose your Personal Information to others, whether or not they are users of the Site, on our Site or through the Services or otherwise, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them.
Social Media.
If you have opted to link your Account to your Social Media account, you can easily share content from the Services to these third party services, in accordance with your Account settings (which you may change at any time) and respective policies of these third parties.  If you connect your Account with one of these services, you may be giving such third party service access to your Personal Information or Contact Data.
Service Providers.
We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate or enhance the Services (for example, we share parts of Your Information with service providers in order to facilitate data associations and to create a more complete data record of your contacts), to provide the Services on our behalf (such as payment processing), to assist us in analyzing how the Services is used, and to perform services related to administration of the Services or the Site (including, without limitation, maintenance, payments, hosting and database management services, website analytics and administration).  We may share Your Information, including your Personal Information and Content Data, with such third party service providers, so that they may perform these tasks on our behalf. While these third party service providers may not sell Your Information, they may use Your Information, including your Contact Data, to make associations between data elements that constitute Public Data (e.g., email address, twitter handle or Facebook username) and disclose these data elements to their end users even if the association was previously undisclosed. For example, if a person has a twitter handle, an email address and a Facebook page, all of which constitute Public Data, and the part of Your Information shared with them includes the data association to tie those three elements of Public Data together, such third party may disclose that connection. They are obligated to comply with this Policy and may not use Your Information for any other purpose.
Non-Personal Identifiable Information and Aggregate Information.

This shared information may be used for industry analysis, demographic profiling, other commercial purposes and to deliver targeted advertising about other products and services. Any information shared in these contexts will not contain your Personal Information.
Combined Information.
We may combine certain Personal Identifiable Information with Non-Personal Identifiable Information in order to allow us to create information packages and services that are better tailored to your interests and preferences. Among other things, linking this information may allow us generally to improve and personalize the Site and the Services.
