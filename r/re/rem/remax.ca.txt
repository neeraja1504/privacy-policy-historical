PRIVACY POLICY
Effective April 13, 2016
This is the Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) for REMAX.ca which is run through the combined efforts of  RE/MAX of Western Canada, providing information on properties in the provinces and territories of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Yukon, Northwest and Nunavut (“RWC”) and RE/MAX Integra, providing information on properties in the provinces of Ontario, Newfoundland, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island  (“Integra”) (collectively “RG”, “us,” “our,” or “we”).  Your privacy is very important to us. The purpose of this Policy is to disclose what Personal Information (as defined below) and other information we may collect from you, how we may collect it, with whom we may share it, as well as the choices you have regarding our collection of information and our use and disclosure of that information to other parties.
We may collect information through our website located at REMAX.ca, other sites accessible via subdomains, mobile versions of any of these sites, and any other site on which this Policy is posted (each a “Site” and, collectively, the “Sites”), as well as our mobile application (the “Application”).  The Application and Sites are collectively referred to as the “Services”).  Terms not otherwise defined here will have the same definitions as set forth in our Terms of Service.
Except as otherwise discussed in this Policy, this document only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you through our Services. For some services, we may collect and transfer Personal Information to a service provider, or you may visit other sites or service providers through third-party links in our Services, who may collect and use your Personal Information for other purposes. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third-party sites before you disclose your Personal Information to others.
If you do not agree to the terms of this Policy, please do not use the Services.
INFORMATION WE COLLECT
We may collect personal and other information about you when you use our Services, as described below. “Personal Information” is information which can be used to distinguish or trace an individual’s identity, such as their name, mailing address, email address, or phone number, whether used alone, or when combined with other personal or identifying information which is linked or linkable to a specific individual.
We typically collect Personal Information and other data from you, and use that information as set forth in this Policy or otherwise communicated to you from time to time (subject to your consent when required by applicable laws).
WHEN YOU REGISTER OR SIGN UP FOR OUR SERVICES
You may register on our Services in order to save searches, sign up for alerts, access our real estate resources, and for other features we may add from time to time. You may be registered for our Services automatically when you contact one of our agents regarding a property or inquire about us or our Services. If you register on our Services, we collect Personal Information such as your name, email, address and any other Personal Information required on the registration form. If you wish, you may provide us your phone number. We primarily use this information to provide information you have requested, manage and correspond with you about your account, send you information and newsletters related to properties, real estate markets, information related to real estate, and/or other information we think may interest you, and for other matters described in this Policy.
NEWSLETTERS, INQUIRIES AND EMAILS
We may offer newsletters and/or other communications to share information with you about RE/MAX, independently owned and operated RE/MAX franchisees, independent real estate sales associates, real estate, helpful guides and information, and other topics or offers in which we believe you may be interested, about us and our related entities, or about our advertisers, sponsors, or other business partners.  You may sign up to receive information from a specific agent, office, or our general mailing list. If you inquire regarding a property, an independent RE/MAX real estate sales associate may contact you regarding that or related properties to the extent related to your inquiry.   In addition, if you indicate that a property is one of your “favourites,” you will automatically be placed on a list to receive email updates regarding that property (which will be sent by the independent listing agent).
Please note, if you choose to provide your email address or other contact information to an independent RE/MAX sales associate, we collect this information on behalf of that agent and we will submit your information to that agent.  However, we cannot control how these independent sales associates or the independently owned and operated RE/MAX offices use that information, and therefore this Policy does not apply their use of your Personal Information. Please contact the agent or office directly or follow the links included in the communications you receive from the agent to learn more about their privacy practices.

CONTESTS OR SWEEPSTAKES
We may operate or promote contests and sweepstakes through our Services, which may require registration in order to enter. We may collect information such as your name, phone number, address, email and other information included on the sign up form. Please note, the privacy practices of a particular contest or sweepstakes may vary from the practices stated in this Policy; for example when the contest or sweepstakes is sponsored by a third party and hosted on their site. Where the terms of a sweepstakes or contest include privacy practices that differ from or conflict with this Policy, the privacy practices of the contest or sweepstakes you entered will control, and will be disclosed in the rules for that promotion. Without limiting the foregoing, your Personal Information may be used by us or a third party to contact you for winner notification, prize delivery confirmation or other promotional purposes. Your entry in the contest or sweepstakes may also result in your being added to our mailing/texting lists as well as those of our promotional partners associated with the contest or sweepstakes. Acceptance of a prize may require you (unless prohibited by law) to allow us to post publicly some of your information on the Services, such as on a winner’s page, in the event you win a contest or sweepstakes.
In some instances, a third-party advertiser or sponsor may operate or host a contest or sweepstakes on our Services (or promoted through our Services), and may collect your information. In those cases, where we are not the sponsor, operator or host of the contest or sweepstakes, we may have no control over the information collected and accordingly urge you to review the official rules of the contest/sweepstakes as well as the advertiser’s or sponsor’s privacy policy applicable to the contest or sweepstakes before participating.
COOKIES, WEB BEACONS AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES
Our Services use cookies, which are small, commonly-used files that are transferred to your computer by us or a third party when you allow your browser to accept cookies. Similarly, we, our third party service providers or advertisers may also use “web beacons,” “pixel tags” or other tracking technologies, which are typically small pieces of code placed on a web page to monitor behavior and collect certain data regarding the actions of our guests online. These cookies and other technologies may be used to track your online traffic patterns, to enhance your experience when using our Services, to store information during your session, to personalize the Services for you based on your preferences and selections, to target advertising or content to you (as described further below) and to collect Information about you and your visit to our Services for other marketing and business purposes. You can adjust your privacy preferences regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies through your browser. However, disabling cookies may impair your user experience and disable certain features of our Services.
Our Services may use cookies or other technologies provided by website analytics services such as Google Analytics to help us better understand how our Services are used. By tracking how and when you use our Services, these technologies help us determine which features and content on our Services are most important to our visitors. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, you can turn off cookies using your browser’s settings menu; however, this may eliminate our ability to provide a personalized or user-friendly experience.

Data about your activities online may be collected for use in providing advertising tailored to your individual interests, either by us, our affiliates, or third parties. We may use third parties such as network advertisers and ad exchanges to serve advertisements across the internet and may use third party analytics service providers to evaluate and provide us and/or third parties with information about the use of these ads on third party websites and viewing of ads and of our content. The information collected may include information about your visits to our Services, such as the pages you have viewed. These third-party tracking technologies may be set to, among other things: (a) help deliver advertisements to you that you might be interested in; (b) prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times; and (c) understand the effectiveness of the advertisements that have been delivered to you. This collection and ad targeting takes place both on our Services and on third-party websites or services that participate in the ad network, such as websites that feature advertisements delivered by the ad network. This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. We and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as a DoubleClick cookie) together to report how your ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to our Services. To learn more about how to opt out of Google’s use of cookies, visit the Google’s Ads Settings, here. To learn more about how to opt out of DoubleClick’s use of cookies, visit the DoubleClick opt-out page, here.

HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION
Information we collect may be shared with a variety of parties, depending upon the purpose for and context in which that information was provided. When you search for a property, we will redirect you to the site of an independently owned and operated RE/MAX franchise office and provide information you have submitted to us, including the parameters of the search, and if you have registered, we may provide your contact information to that office. Similarly, if you request to be contacted by an agent or office or otherwise request information from us, we will disclose the Personal Information you provide to appropriate affiliates of RG to satisfy your request.
We reserve the right to share your Personal Information with our current or future affiliated entities, subsidiaries, and parent companies. We may also share your Personal Information and other information with trusted third parties for marketing, advertising, or other commercial purposes, and we may occasionally share your Personal Information with trusted parties who may have information that we believe will interest you.
We sometimes offer promotions, such as sweepstakes or contests, in conjunction with a sponsor, and may share your information with these sponsors.  We may also occasionally share Personal Information with our affiliated entities or third parties who have offers or information we believe would be of interest to you. For example, we may share certain information with certain third parties including marketing partners, national industry organizations, and prospective affiliates. We may provide such information as part of Google’s DoubleClick program.
We may share analyses of our server logs, including details regarding usage of our Services and general information about our audience, with current or potential advertisers or business partners. Such disclosures typically aggregate usage data from these analyses and other information not generally considered to be Personal Information.
We may, without your consent, share Personal Information and other data with service providers who provide certain services on our behalf, or in the other circumstances noted below. For example, we may share certain Personal Information we collect with third parties such as providers of data hosting or processing services, payment processors, or other service providers. We also reserve the right to share any information we possess or data derived from it with service providers or others if such information has been reasonably de-identified.
In addition, in the event that we go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition, liquidation or sale of all or a portion of our assets, Personal Information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred, or may be disclosed (subject to confidentiality restrictions) during the due diligence process. If such a transfer occurs, the acquiring company’s use of your Personal Information will still be subject to this Policy, and any privacy choices you selected in your online profile on our Services.
Finally, we may, without your consent, access and disclose your Personal Information, any communications sent or received by you, and any other information that we may have about you as may be permitted or as we believe in good faith may be reasonably necessary to comply with any law, regulation, rule or court order; pursuant to subpoenas or other requests from governmental, regulatory or administrative agencies or law enforcement authorities; to respond to any claims, or to prevent, investigate, identify persons or organizations potentially involved in, or take any action regarding suspected fraud, violations of our Terms of Service, or activity that appears to us to be illegal or we believe may expose us to legal liability. Additionally, we may disclose Personal Information in situations that we believe to be emergencies involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person or property, if we believe that your information in any way relates to that threat.
