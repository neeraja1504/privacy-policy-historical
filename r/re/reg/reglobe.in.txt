Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy describes how ReGlobe ("we" or "us") gathers and uses personal information submitted on our website www.ReGlobe.in (ReGlobe). It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information.
ReGlobe strives to give the best offers to sell your old gadget; then ReGlobe refers you to a buyer for your product. ReGlobe will share your personal information with these carefully selected buyers when you agree to submit for a quote. This means we do not take your credit card/debit card information and we do not take your money. Registration on ReGlobe is voluntary, if you do decide to register; we will not share your personal information until you agree to submit to a quote. You do get access to certain features if you register, but membership is not necessary to find sale offers. If you have questions or complaints regarding our privacy policy or practices, please contact us.
Information We Collect
We collect standard information about ReGlobe users such as IP addresses, browser type, operating system, what you searched for, referring and exit pages, the dates and times of visits, and other site usage behavior ("Site Visitation Data"). Site Visitation Data is used to administer the site and provide general statistics regarding the use of the ReGlobe website. We may also use Site Visitation Data to display advertising or send targeted email marketing messages you may find interesting and to suppress advertising that might not interest you.
To help improve our site and services, we may collect certain technical information from your browser software, screen resolution and the website that referred you to us.
Sharing information with friends and in user forums
The ReGlobe website allows you to share certain information with friends that you select. Please bear in mind that ReGlobe.in cannot control what your friends do with the information you share with them, so you should only share with friends you trust. Once displayed on publicly viewable web pages, information that you share can be collected and used by others. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, please contact us at info@reglobe.in. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.
Furthermore, if you participate in a user forum on the ReGlobe.in website, your comments and your ReGlobe.in username will be displayed to all ReGlobe.in users on the forum. ReGlobe.in is not responsible for what any user or third party may do with information that you choose to share.
We may also provide a feature allowing you to invite a friend to join ReGlobe.in. If you provide a friend's email address to us for this reason, we will use that email address only for the purpose of sending a onetime invitation to your friend. Your friend may contact us at info@reglobe.in to remove their information from our database.
Use of personal information
We will treat your personal information as confidential, and we will not share your personal information with third parties without your permission, except in the limited circumstances described below. If you accept a referral from ReGlobe.in to one of our partner sites, we may provide PII to the partner site to save you having to re-enter that information. When you select a partner site to sell your phone to, you must opt in to allow your PII to be submitted to that partner site, and you agree to be bound by their privacy policy as regards use of your PII.
We may provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities such as fulfilling your request for a free shipping kit, purchasing your phone, or sending confirmation or other emails. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.
We may provide your personal information to our third party marketing partners so they may offer you goods and services which you may find of interest. If you do not wish to receive offers from these third parties, you may unsubscribe from their mailing lists by following the instructions in the offer. If you respond to any such offer, your information will be subject to that third party's privacy policy. We may disclose your personal information when we reasonably believe that it is required by a law or legal process and to protect and defend the rights and interests of ReGlobe, its affiliates, suppliers, or users. In the event ReGlobe goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred.
We may use and disclose your aggregated usage information with others, in a form that does not identify any individual, to allow ReGlobe and our advertisers to present targeted advertising to you. We may disclose to third parties, including advertisers and potential business partners, aggregated statistics that we develop from your usage habits, preferences, and history. For example, we may disclose generalized information about usage habits based on aggregated statistics developed from your site usage behavior and search history. This statistical information will not identify any individual.
