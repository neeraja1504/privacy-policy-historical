Further information in this regard is provided in the following statement.
2.        Legal basis for processing personal data
Article 6, Paragraph 1, Item a) of the EU's general data protection regulation (GDPR) serves as the legal basis for processing personal data, insofar as we have obtained the concerned person's consent to processing of such data.
