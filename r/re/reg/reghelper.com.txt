2. Information Collected.
Access and Aggregate Information. In general, you can visit the Site without telling us who you are or revealing any personally identifiable information about you. Like most standard web site services, we use log files. Our web servers collect the domain or “IP address” of visitors, browser type, type of computer, search engines used, referring/exit pages, operating systems used, type of Web browser used, aggregate information on pages accessed on the Site and statistical information related to our products and the performance of our products, and broad demographic information for aggregate use.
Our web servers also seek (as many web sites do) to place a “cookie” (a small data file) on your computer’s hard drive which allows the server to determine your computer when it visits again. This cookie is not used to store any personally identifiable information. For more information on cookies, please  click here.
Software Installation. During the download process and/or installation of the Software, you will be asked to provide personally identifiable information, including your name and e-mail address. We use this information to contact you by e-mail regarding your installation, registration, updates, and send you special offers from us and trusted third parties. Your e-mail address is not shared with these trusted third parties. Your personal information provided during installation will be stored in our database, along with other information collected during the installation process and by our cookies (e.g., link to referring site, e-mail, or advertisement, IP address, browser capabilities, and total Invalid Entries, Junk Files, or Available Updates).
Software Registration. When upgrading the Software to the full version, you will be asked to provide personally identifiable information, including e-mail address, your name, and additional contact information (ie, telephone number and home address) and billing information (such as a credit card number and expiration date). Your personal information provided during installation will be stored in our database, along with other information collected during the installation process and by our cookies (e.g., link to referring site, e-mail, or advertisement, IP address, browser capabilities, and total Invalid Entries, Junk Files, or Available Updates). Any credit card numbers provided to us will only be stored for as long as necessary to complete the transaction. In the event that we use a third party service provided for processing credit card payments, your credit card information will not be transferred to us and will be subject to such third party’s privacy policy. This information will be stored in our database along with other information collected by our cookies and during the installation and/or registration process. For more information on the types of information collected by our cookies, please  click here.
Contacts. When you contact us or send e-mail inquiries to us, we may keep a record of this communication. Additionally, the return e-mail address is used to answer the e-mail inquiry we receive. We do not share the return e-mail address with any third party, however we may use the e-mail address for other business related purposes.
Voluntary Customer Surveys. We may periodically conduct both business and individual customer surveys. We encourage you to participate in these surveys because they provide us with important information that helps us to improve the types of services we offer and how we provide them to you. Your personally identifiable information will remain confidential. Participation in our surveys is voluntary.
We take the information we receive from individuals responding to our surveys and combine (or aggregate) it with the responses of other users to create broader, generic responses to the survey questions (such as gender, age, residence, hobbies, education, employment, industry sector, or other demographic information).

6. Security of Collected Information.
This Site takes every precaution to protect our users information. When users submit sensitive information via the Site, their information is protected both online and offline. When our registration form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry – SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of web browsers becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked or open when users are just surfing.
While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user information offline. The data center which provides our web hosting services is an SAS-70 Level II Certified facility.
While we make every effort to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third party hackers from illegally obtaining this information.

The Federal Trade Commission regulates the means by which web site operators collect and use personal information from children under age 13, pursuant to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (the "Act").
