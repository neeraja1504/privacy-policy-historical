This Privacy Policy is intended to inform you of our policies and practices regarding the collection, use, disclosure, security and integrity of any Personal Information you submit to us using our web site or otherwise. Personal Information is information that personally identifies you such as your name, mailing address, email address or phone number.
Collection of Personal Information
We require you to register with us to use certain parts of our service. During registration and subsequent use of our service, we may collect the following types of information:
Information you provide: When you register for the Retrevo service, we ask you for Personal Information such as your name and email address, demographic information such as gender and zip code, and product usage information.

Cookies: Retrevo may use cookies to store and sometimes track information about you. A cookie is a small data file sent to your browser from a web server to be stored on your hard drive that allows easier access the next time the same page is visited. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some Retrevo features and services may not function properly if you disable cookies in your browser.
Preference Based Advertising: We also work with and permit certain third parties, including advertising networks and website analysis firms, to place cookies on your computer/browser when you visit our Sites. These third party cookies are used to gather non-PII about your activities on our Sites and third party sites to serve you with advertisements while you are on third party sites (“Third-Party Ads”). If you do not wish to participate in this activity, please click here to opt-out.
Some important notes: (1) the opt-out tools for Third-Party Ads include all the advertising networks that Retrevo works with, but also many that Retrevo does not work with; (2) opting out of Our Ads does not automatically serve as an opt-out from Third-Party Ads – the same is true the other way around. To opt-out of Our Ads and Third-Party Ads, you must use each respective opt-out tool above; (3) the opt-out tools for both Our Ads and Third-Party Ads rely on cookies to ensure that your non-PII is not used for online advertising purposes (“Opt-out Cookies”). Therefore, if you buy a new computer, change web browsers or delete these Opt-out Cookies from your computer, you will need to perform the relevant opt-out tasks again; and (4) the features of your internet browser and/or certain add-on software may allow you to block or limit the use of cookies for preference based advertising and other purposes. We cannot, however, promise that our Sites will work well or be compatible with these alternative methods of blocking or limiting the use of cookies.
Log information: Your web browser sends some information automatically when you connect to a web server. This information may include the IP address of your computer, date and time of access, type of web browser used, the operating system and other information that uniquely identifies a browser. When you use the Retrevo service, our servers automatically record this information in log files. We also record search terms that you type, web pages you access and other information that may describe your behavior.
