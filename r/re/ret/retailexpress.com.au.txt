Use of cookies
Cookies are pieces of text that are transferred into the memory of your computer to store preferences, record session information and collect information on how you visit and access our Website. The use of cookies can improve the efficiency of your navigation of our Website and generally assist in our quest to provide services to you in the most convenient and prompt manner.
Credit related information
Retail Express may use personal information to assess your credit situation when you apply for some products. We might ask you for information about yourself and then seek a credit report from a credit reporting agency. We’ll always tell you before we seek a credit report, and we won’t get one if you’re under 18. The credit report provided by a credit reporting agency may include information like your employment history, previous credit checks, any problems you’ve had paying bills and whether those issues were resolved. Retail Express uses this information to assess whether we’re entering into an arrangement that is sensible for both you and us. After you become a client, we store the crucial bits of information from the credit report and our own credit assessment. We may continue to use this information to manage credit, and to make sure we’re offering and providing the right services to you. Retail Express doesn’t use credit related information to generate marketing lists.  Sometimes, we might ask a credit reporting agency to do that for us. You can ask the credit reporting agency not to use your information for these purposes by getting in touch with them directly. Retail Express works with client service partners inside and outside Australia. Where necessary, we give our partners access to the credit information they need to help manage credit and your services. You can get access to credit related information we hold about you, ask us to correct it, or make a complaint, as described elsewhere in this policy. If we agree that our records need to be corrected, and we’ve previously disclosed that information to a credit reporting agency or other person, we’ll tell them about the correction too. You can ask the credit reporting agencies not to use or disclose the information in their files if you think you have been or are likely to become a victim of fraud. You can find out more about the credit reporting agencies Retail Express works with at www.veda.com.au and www.dnb.com.au. Their websites give their contact details and their policies about the management of your personal information.
Privacy complaints
If you consider there is a legitimate dispute between us and you in respect of a breach of this Privacy Policy, you must first go through the following dispute resolution process before the commencement of any arbitration or other legal proceedings:
you must give us notice in writing setting out full details of the dispute;
to resolve the dispute, we will engage in negotiations and discussions with you in order to seek to resolve the dispute. You must participate in the negotiations and discussions in good faith and we will use all reasonable endeavours to resolve the dispute;
if the dispute cannot be resolved within one month of negotiations and discussions commencing, you may request that the dispute be referred to mediation upon providing a written undertaking to bear all costs involved in the mediation;
if the parties to the dispute cannot agree on a mediator within seven days after a request, the president of the Queensland Law Society Inc or that president’s nominee may appoint a mediator; and
unless agreed by the mediator and the parties, the mediation must be held within fifteen days of a request for the dispute to be referred to mediation and must occur on the Sunshine Coast unless otherwise agreed.
