Introduction
Retreaver Inc. (“ Retreaver ”), respects your privacy and we are committed to protecting it through our compliance with this policy.
This policy describes the types of information we may collect from you or that you may provide when you access our website, view our content, and use our products and services (together, the “ Services ”) and our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting and disclosing that information. Your privacy is critically important to us. We will not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of eighteen.
This policy applies to information we collect:
On retreaver.com.
In email and other electronic messages between you and Retreaver.
It does not apply to information collected by:
us offline or through any other means, including on any other website operated by Retreaver or any third party; or
any third party, including through any application or content (including advertising) that may link to or be accessible from our Services.
Please read this policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how we will treat it. By using the Services, you are agreeing to our Terms of Service, this Privacy Policy, and our Copyright Policy. Please read them carefully. If you do not agree to our Terms of Service, this Privacy Policy, or our Copyright Policy, you may not use the Services.
We may modify this Privacy Policy from time to time. All modifications to our Privacy Policy are effective immediately when posted. If you do not agree to the modified Privacy Policy, you may not use the Services.
At Retreaver we have a few fundamental principles:
We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)
We don’t share your personal information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our Services.

We collect this information:

Like most website operators, Retreaver collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Retreaver’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how visitors use the website. From time to time, we may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate (e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website). We may disclose aggregated information about our users, and information that does not identify any individual, without restriction.
Retreaver also collects potentially personally-identifying information like IP addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on retreaver.com blogs. Retreaver only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.
