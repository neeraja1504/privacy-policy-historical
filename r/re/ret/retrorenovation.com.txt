Why we collect, use and retain data
The websites are journalistic in nature and depend on advertising revenues to sustain them. In order to run the websites efficiently including in a manner expected in today’s media world, we collect customer-, user-, technical- and marketing data that enable features of value to users and which enable us to administer and sustain the sites effectively. The data collected are used to run the websites and not sold to third parties. As possible, we use well-known, industry-standard and industry-leading technologies such as WordPress, Google applications, professional servers, professional newsletter services, etc. In a number of cases, you provide consent and proactively submit data (for example, your email address, when you comment or sign up for a newsletter.) In other cases, technologies like cookies, log files, etc. are activated and other data such as IP addresses are captured in order to do such things as target advertising and analyze our websites so that we can effectively operate our business and offer you these websites and their content.
If you would like to opt out of data collection and/or retention, details on how to do so are contained in the following sections including with the provision of links to or addresses for other websites’ Privacy Policies and control center pages where you can proactively direct the use of your data.
