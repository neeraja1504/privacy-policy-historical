Privacy Policy
At RN.org, we are committed to protecting your privacy.  This Privacy Policy will advise you about how we protect your personal information, and about what choices you have concerning the use of that information.  Please read this policy carefully.  We may need to change this policy from time to time in order to address new issues and reflect changes on our site.  We will post those changes here so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose that information to anyone.
The Information We Collect and How We Use
We collect information on the site in order to make it possible for you to purchase items on our website and to enhance your overall experience.  We also monitor traffic patterns and site usage to help us develop and improve design and layout.  RN.org will not collect personal information about you without your knowledge and consent.
We may employ outside agents, meaning other companies or individuals to perform functions on our behalf, such as sending postal mail and email, promotional activities, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service.  These RN.org agents have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.  Other than our outside agents, we keep all of your personal information private and will not share it with any third party, unless you have authorized us to or we are legally required to do so.  RN.org may also release account information when we believe, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to enforce or apply the provisions of our Terms of Service or to protect the rights, property or safety of RN.org, our users, or others.
RN.ORG may provide information in the aggregate to third parties without disclosure of personally identifying information.
Transfers of Information
As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets.  In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets.  Also, in the event that RN.org or substantially all of its assets are acquired, member information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
Links
Our site contains links from the sites of our advertisers, members of the healthcare industry and others.  RN.org is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any of these linked sites.
IP Address
RN.org tracks IP (internet protocol) addresses for system administration purposes.  IP addresses are logged per user's session and help to determine how often areas on our site are visited.  However, RN.org does not track IP addresses with any of your personal information.
Cookies
We use cookies to improve your experience on our website.  “Cookies” are small pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer's hard drive for record-keeping purposes.  We use cookies to remember information members give us so they don't have to reenter it each time they visit the site.  Cookies identify a user’s computer.  If you chose to decline cookies you will still be able to use most of the features on our website.
Correcting or Updating Personal Information
If the personal information we have gathered from you changes, we will gladly correct, update, or remove any data you have previously provided to us.  You may change your personal information at any time by accessing your “account info” page after logging in as a user and making the necessary changes.  We may retain a copy of the prior version for our records.
Security of your information
When you make a purchase on our website, the bank needs to obtain your credit card number, expiration date and billing address information.  This information is encrypted and transmitted safely over the internet to our bank where it is stored in their secure servers – where it is used for billing purposes only. RN.org does not have access to this information as all credit card processing is handled by our bank and is not stored on the RN.org servers.   Our bank uses SSL encryption to help ensure that all the personal information you provide is encrypted and remains private (unless sent by an unsecured means, such as email).  This helps to maintain the confidentiality of your information.
We strive to protect your personal information, however we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us.
