genetic or biometric data (such as finger prints)
We do not require data concerning political opinion, membership of a trade union, religious or philosophical beliefs which are also categorised as sensitive personal data however this information may be disclosed by you as part of the underwriting process, if you consider it is relevant. We have a very general question on the application form which asks clients to disclose any feature of their lifestyle which may affect / threaten their life expectancy and through this you may disclose further sensitive information.
IFGL will require your explicit consent to process sensitive information. If we do not receive this consent from you we will not be able to provide you with your product.
If you make any of your sensitive personal data public such as putting information on social media we can process that data as this information will be in the public domain.
We can also further process your sensitive personal data in the exercise or defence of legal claims for or against IFGL or whenever we need to comply with a court order.
How we use your personal information
As the controllers of your personal data IFGL may process your data:
a) to administer and operate policies
b) to fulfil IFGL’s legitimate interests, in particular in the course of the operation, support and development of our businesses, evaluating customer service, efficiency, cost and risk and for management purposes
c) carrying out anti money laundering and conflict checks for the prevention of financial crime or fraud
d) exercising and defending our legal rights, complying with regulatory authorities and legislation
e) for audits by national and regulatory enforcement
We will ensure that your personal data is processed in a manner that ensures it is appropriately secure and we will protect your information against unauthorised or unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction or damage. We will do this with the implementation of internal policies, procedures, encryption of emails and data, building security such as swipe cards for building access, CCTV, internal IT testing, IT testing by external parties, internal auditing and staff training therefore treating your personal data with integrity and with the utmost confidence.
As part of our Underwriting Process we require and record data concerning clients’ health. This is primarily gathered from questions on the application form, which include sensitive, personal data. We will use this data as part of our decision making process.
Most clients will also undergo a medical examination, and some degree of medical testing will be undergone for example blood and urine samples are taken and results are recorded.
We are able to process your health data for the purposes of carrying out insurance business.
We can also process health information which relates to a data subject who is the parent, grandparent, great-grandparent or sibling of an insured person.
IFGL will not need to obtain consent of the data subject where we cannot be reasonably expected to obtain consent for the processing of your data. IFGL can process your personal data when IFGL is not aware of you withholding consent.
Your data will not be further processed in a manner that is incompatible with the above purposes.
How the law protects you
Data Protection law allows IFGL to process and retain your personal information only if we have a good reason to do so. This includes sharing your information outside of IFGL. We must have one or more of the following reasons to process and retain your data:
To fulfil a contract we have with you
When it is our legal duty
When it is in our legitimate interest
When you consent to it. (When you give your consent it should be given freely by you along with an informed indication of your wishes which signifies your agreement of your personal data being processed).
The processing of your information is done so within the legitimate interests of business or commercial activities (these are not overridden by prejudice to your privacy rights). For IFGL to comply with applicable regulations it will be necessary, in some cases, to disclose your personal details which would be classed as a legal duty. We will also process your data in order that we can assist you with your policy under the terms and conditions set out in your policy of which IFGL consider this to be a contract between you and IFGL.
Third party data processing for group insurance policies and insurance on the life of another
We can process your personal information if it is necessary for the purpose of carrying on business which consists of effecting or carrying out a contract or is personal data which relates to a data subject who is not a party to the contract or seeking to become a party to the contract and can reasonably be carried out with the consent of the data subject.
Again, as above, processing can be carried out without obtaining consent of the data subject where we cannot be reasonably expected to obtain consent for the processing of that information for instance a nominated beneficiary of a policy who does not know that they have been nominated. IFGL can process the data subject’s personal data when IFGL is not aware of you withholding consent.
Sending data outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”)
Your personal data may be transferred to another country, which may also include countries outside of the EEA. This may be because you or your Financial Adviser live outside the EEA or your nearest IFGL office is outside of the EEA. In those cases where the relevant country has been checked to ensure it has an adequate level of data protection by the European Commission, or we need to make the transfer in order to perform a contract in your interests, we will ensure that the transferred personal data is protected by a data transfer contract. Further details can be obtained by making a request in writing to our Data Protection Officer (“DPO”). We can provide you with copies of any data transfer agreements on request.
To ensure we are only transferring data to countries which have the correct adequacy ratings we regularly check the EU website.
How we use your information to make automated decisions
IFGL does not use automated decision making processes.
If you choose not to give personal information
IFGL may need to collect personal information by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you.
