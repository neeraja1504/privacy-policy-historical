This may include your name, address, email address, telephone or fax number, IP address and certain other information, which we explain in more detail below. We also use cookies, which gather certain forms of information from your computer to help us monitor and improve Site usage and performance.  You can choose not to provide us with this information, but certain portions of the Site may not be available to you.
We do not disclose this information to third parties for their marketing purposes, but we do use third party software and services to assist with analyzing information regarding use of the Site.  We may also disclose your information to others for other purposes, particularly if required to do so by law.  The privacy policy for the Site is set forth below and you should contact RXinsider's corporate offices if you have questions or concerns about this policy or the use of your information.
