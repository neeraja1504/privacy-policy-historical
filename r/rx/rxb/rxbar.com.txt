A. Information You Provide to Us
We may obtain information that you provide directly to us on the Site, for example when you register on the Site, make an online purchase on the Site, request information from us, contact customer support, or otherwise communicate with us. This information may include personal information, which is information that can be used to identify you individually, such as your name, home address, work address, billing address, shipping address, zip code or city, email address, telephone number, payment information, date of birth, and user-generated content including product reviews or profile pictures.
If you are providing us personal information on behalf of a wholesaler, such as to register for a wholesaler Site account, you may provide us your company affiliation, business website, and business Tax ID. Acting on behalf of a wholesaler or nonprofit, you may also apply to receive an event donation from us by submitting an application, which may include your or another person’s contact name, contact email, contact phone number, website, address, shipping name, shipping phone number, shipping email, shipping address, Facebook URL, Twitter URL, Instagram URL, and any information contained in your organization’s 501c3.
Our Site may include a send-to-a-friend feature that makes it easy for you to forward information or materials from our Site to friends or family by email. In order to address your email message, the feature may ask you to input the recipient’s email address and/or similar information (including your email address). If you use send-to-friend features on the Site you represent that you have the permission of your friend, family, or other recipient to provide us their personal information.
B.  Information We Collect Through Cookies and Similar Technologies
In addition to information you submit through the Site, we may collect certain information using automated tools, such as cookies. “Cookies” are small data files stored by your web browser on your device. Cookies may allow a website to recognize a user’s device, record user preferences, track the pages a user clicks on while visiting the website, and identify the website visited immediately beforehand. The types of information we collect automatically when you visit the Site may include IP addresses, device identifiers, browser characteristics, operating system details, language preferences, referring URLs, length of visits, anonymous traffic data, and pages viewed.
We may use location-identifying technologies such as GPS (global positioning systems) software, geo-filtering, and other location-aware technologies to locate you (sometimes precisely), or make assumptions about your location, for purposes such as verifying your location and delivering or restricting content, including third party ads, based on your location. If you have enabled GPS or use other location-based features on the Site, your device location may be tracked by us and third parties.
We may use third-party technology, such as Facebook, to collect and use data in connection with interest-based advertising. These third-party ad technology companies and advertisers may use, store, or access cookies, web beacons, and other storage technologies to collect or receive information from the Site and elsewhere on the Internet and use that information to provide advertising services to us, including interest-based advertising or advertisements targeted to your interests.
We may use certain third-party web analytics services, such as Google Analytics, DoubleClick, Yotpo, and Facebook Custom Audiences, to help us understand and analyze how visitors use the Site and serve ads on our behalf across the Internet. We’ve implemented Google Analytics Advertising features such as Remarketing with Google Analytics, Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reports, Google Ads Remarketing, Google Ads Similar Audiences, and Google Signals. We and third-party vendors may use first-party cookies or other first-party identifiers and third-party cookies or other third-party identifiers to provide information to service providers that help us operate and manage our Site, advertise, market or promote our products, process orders, and fulfill and deliver products that you purchase from us. As an advertising publisher, we may use tags in connection with the Nielsen Digital Ad Ratings Service for Google Ad Manager. Using cookies and pixel tags (also known as web beacons), these third-party analytics services collect information about your visits to the Site and other websites in order to deliver advertisements that may be of particular interest to you.
We may combine certain automatically-collected information with other information we obtain about you, which may include data we obtain from third parties.
We or third parties may collect personal information about your online activities over time and across different websites when you use the Site.
C. Information Collected Through Third Parties or Other Sources
We may obtain personal information about you from third parties or other sources such as our third-party service providers, public databases, other brands and groups within Insurgent Brands, affiliates or partners, our parent company or subsidiaries, or data aggregators and commercially available sources. For example, if you process a payment through our Site, you may choose to do so through a third-party service provider (e.g., PayPal). You may also apply to Company job openings through the Site, which is facilitated and managed by our third-party service provider that may share with us information contained in your job application such as your educational and employment history, resume, cover letter, LinkedIn profile, and website. Alternatively, these third parties may provide us your gender and demographic information in an anonymous/de-identified, aggregated data set to demonstrate the makeup of their audience and/or user base. For example, an advertising partner may let us know what percentage of people who click on an RXBAR ad are female.
The Site may include features that are designed to permit interactions that you initiate between the Site and third-party websites or services, including third-party social networks (collectively, “Social Features”). For example, you may be able to “like” or “share” our content (e.g., through Facebook or Twitter), tag us in photos or public posts, or watch an embedded video from a hosted party (e.g., YouTube). In addition, when you register for a Site account, you may have an option to use your Google, Amazon, or other account provided by a third-party website or application to facilitate the registration, log-in, or transaction process on the Site, or otherwise link accounts.
When you interact with Social Features, both we and the third-party services that operate those Social Features may have access to certain information about you and your use of both our Site and theirs, such as your profile picture. Personal information we receive from third parties or other sources may be subject to third-party privacy policies and terms. We are not responsible for these policies and terms.
2. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION

In some cases, we may use your information to offer you some form of referral award for encouraging an action on the part of a recipient (for example, you can earn a reward if the recipient you send a referral to chooses to register for one of our offerings after receiving the email from you). Such offers are subject to their additional terms and policies.
We may use your information to remarket or reengage advertisements to you, to use third party similar audience features, or for other advertising purposes such as delivering interest-based advertisements or advertisements across sites, mobile apps, and devices over time.
