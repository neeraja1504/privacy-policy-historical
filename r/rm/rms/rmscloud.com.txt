Screen Shots
Screen shots used in demonstrations and examples in manuals, advertising and on our website do not include details of any real person.

Remote access to customers’ databases is needed to provide an efficient and rapid response to requests for assistance. RMS staff will only connect to a customer’s data with the full knowledge of the customer and will advise when connection is terminated.
Internet Transmission
No data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be secure. While RMS will endeavour to protect customer information, it cannot guarantee the security of any information any person may transmit when they access its website. Even though RMS encrypts data transmitted over the Internet, it still cannot guarantee data transmitted cannot be unencrypted by persons with nefarious intentions. Nonetheless, the likelihood of this occurring is extremely low.
