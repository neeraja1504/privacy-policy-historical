We only collect personal information that is relevant to the purpose of our website. This information allows us to provide you with a customized and efficient experience.

We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. The Roosevelts and its authorized agents automatically receive and record certain “traffic data” on their server logs from your browser including your IP address, The Roosevelts cookie information, and the page you requested.
