5. Cookies / Tracking Technologies.
We collect data through cookies and other tracking technologies. For more information about cookies, see ourCookie Policy.
We may use cookies, pixels, scripts, etags, advertising IDs, IFA/IDFA, log files, clear gifs, web beacons, deep linking or other technology. We may use these technologies in a variety of ways, including but not limited to:
Tracking Sales to Consumers;
Facilitating Commissions to Influencers;
Creation of user profiles;
Providing custom, personalized content and information to Influencers and Consumers including without limitation relevant ads, customized ads, interest-based ads and retargeted ads in future navigation;
Remembering information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Services;
Providing cross-app / cross-site functionality across multiple third party mobile apps and websites;
Collect device information which permits generation of device fingerprints and cross-device consumer profiles;
Keeping count of return visits to our Services and Influencers’ sites;
Accumulating and reporting statistical information on Services usage and Influencers’ sites, platform and content;
Determining which features users like best;
Assessing the popularity and effectiveness of the Services;
Determining whether and when an email was opened; and
Improving our Services and creating new services.
You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. However, if you turn off cookies, then you may not be able to utilize certain features of the Services. Turning off and/or deleting cookies does not affect other tracking technologies, such as device fingerprinting.
This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies and other tracking technologies by these Services only.
rS or an affiliate network (each an "Affiliate Network Partner") may drop cookies on a consumer’s device and/or web browser. For example, once an Influencer grabs a Product or Merchant link from our Services, visitors to that Influencer’s website who click on the particular link will be directed by rS or the Affiliate Network Partner to a Merchant’s e-commerce site, at which point rS or the Affiliate Network Partner drops a cookie on the visitor’s browser. These cookies are dropped so that our Services can monetize visits to our Influencers and other actions.
rewardStyle may also utilize third party tracking technology, such as deep linking, to leverage cross-app and cross-site functionality.
Another tracking technology is a script that collects device information to permit what is known as device fingerprinting. (see, e.g., FTC Consumer Guide on Online Tracking - What is device fingerprinting?) For example, this data collection may permit generation of device fingerprints and cross-device profiles to better understand who visits particular Influencers, how often, unique visits, repeat visits, and more.
You agree rS is not liable for the content or use of personal information by third parties, including, without limitation, SNS, Influencers and Merchants, and including their use of cookies and other tracking technologies. Users and Consumers should consult the privacy policies and terms of service for those individual websites.
By agreeing to the terms of this Policy and by using our Services, you consent to the cookies and other tracking technologies referenced above.  It is your responsibility to inform your visitors of the relevant data collection, use and disclosure practices through a privacy policy – see Section 8.  In order for you to be a registered and active user of the Services, you must agree to accept cookies and other tracking technologies and to post a privacy policy. If you wish to opt-out of cookies and other tracking technologies altogether, send an email info@rewardstyle.com to request your account be deleted.
6. Influencers’ Websites/Applications/Other Content.
General. When you begin using links, scripts, cookies and other technologies provided by rS, we will collect and store information about your users and readers. We use this information for tracking sales, abuse prevention, commission processing and data analysis, among other things.

However, information you elect to post on our Services, emails and other information you send to us are not encrypted and such transmissions cannot be considered a secure means of transmitting sensitive information.
You should be aware of the limitations of security, authentication, encryption, and privacy measures used in connection with the Internet and that any information you transmit through the Services may be damaged, corrupted, "sniffed" and/or accessed by another person without your permission. Regardless of the precautions taken by you or by us, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet. Third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, and other users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect from the Services. Therefore, although we work very hard to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private. We cannot ensure or warrant the ultimate security of any information you transmit.
