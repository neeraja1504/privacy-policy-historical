Most of this information is personal, such as your name or email address, but it can also include data such as the kind of computer you are using and how fast your internet connection is.
I collect personal information only when you directly get in touch with me (i.e. calling or sending me an email).

1.) If I believe it necessary to share information to investigate, prevent, or take legal action against fraud, and 2.) If I am required by law to release personal information regarding a specific individual or company.
