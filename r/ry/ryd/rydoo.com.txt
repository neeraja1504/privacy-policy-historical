Rydoo N.V. and iAlbatros Poland Sp.Zo.o and their local subsidiaries provide business process outsourcing services in the areas of travel and expense management using modern technology solutions.
Our expense management services allow the client to capture, track and store his business expenditure receipts, as well as to generate and submit for approval the expense reports derived from those receipts, which are uploaded via either web, e-mail and/or mobile applications.
Our travel management services allow the client to use our web pages, mobile applications, call center, integrated partner applications, instant messaging and social media platforms. This policy applies to all the platforms you can use to get access to our services and all the data we collect using those platforms.
This policy may change when the applicable legislation changes or if we decide to extend our services. Please visit this page regularly to be kept up-to-date.
If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, we kindly advise you to stop using our services.
What kind of information we collect
Information provided by you or your employer
Depending on the services you or your employer has selected, we collect some specific information about you.
To provide you with the best available accommodation, flight or rail ticket we need to know certain things about you, like your first name, last name, ID document number, contact details, other travelers’ data; sometimes also your date of birth can be asked, in order to process the booking.
In order to perform our expense management services, we may also receive and store the following information about you: your bank account number, scanned expense receipts and credit card statements, which may include personal data such as name, address and bank account information.
Use of our services does not always require users to fill in or upload sensitive personal data. In order to avoid unnecessary exposure, we ask you to make sure that sensitive personal data are not filled in or uploaded to your account (intentionally or accidentally) in any form as photos, notes or other if it is not necessary.
Information we collect automatically when you use our services
When you use our services we also collect certain information automatically like your IP address, browser type and version or mobile device data and local settings, e.g. language; activity on our website, including the pages you visited and searches you made.
Information from other sources
If you use a third party payment provider, if you link your profile with social media or instant messaging profile or if you use our platform via third party integrated software we can collect information from those sources.
All our accommodation and transport services providers may also share with us information about you and your trip.
Refer a friend
In case we would enable a refer-a-friend functionality, you must always seek your friend’s consent to our use of your friend’s name and e-mail address to contact them about our services. By providing us with your friend’s name and email address, you warrant that your friend consents to such contact.
What is the purpose of data collection
We need our users and travelers’ data to provide our services to them: searching for hotels and rates available, booking rooms or tickets, managing expenses, creating and transmitting expense reports or any other service we provide and to improve our services for our clients.
We also use your contact information to inform you about any changes to trip itineraries, any actions waiting for you in the system or any new features and services available.
How long do we store your data
Personal data is gathered for a specific purpose and stored also for a specific purpose. The overall rule we apply is that we will delete all the data within 6 months after the end of the year when the data is no longer needed for any purpose.
Please be aware that there are various purposes for which we gather and later process your personal data. We take into consideration all those purposes and have defined a data retention period for each category of the personal data.
Why do we put the deadline on 6 months after the end of the year of termination of the purpose? Because, even though we regularly delete the data that is not needed anymore from our system, this deleted data may stay in the system or the infrastructure logs and backups. These logs and backups are deleted within a period of 6 months.
