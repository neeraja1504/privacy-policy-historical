The EVENT Group engages certain trusted third parties (including data hosting and processing companies, and information technology providers and operators of social media channels and platforms) to help us provide, improve and promote our services and communicate with our customers. We will only disclose your personal information to these third parties to perform tasks on our behalf and in compliance with this Privacy Policy.

We take steps to ensure that our service providers are obliged to protect the privacy and security of your personal information and use it only for the purpose for which it is disclosed. In providing us with your personal information, you consent to this disclosure.
Our hotels and resorts use a reservation system that allows those hotels and resorts to view and access customer personal information on our system (for example to view past booking and transaction details). In providing us with your personal information, you also consent to the disclosure of your personal information to all hotels and resorts owned, managed or operated by the EVENT Group, including any hotels in foreign countries.

Priority Guest Rewards Program
The EVENT Group operates the Priority Guest Rewards loyalty program (“PGR Program”). The hotels that participate in the PGR Program are listed on the website www.priorityguestrewards.com (“Participating Hotels”) and include certain Rydges, QT, and Atura hotels.
Effective from 1 August 2014, any new PGR Program members will automatically also become a member of the Global Hotel Alliance (GHA) loyalty program. Existing PGR Program members need to “opt-in” after 1 August 2014 to become a GHA loyalty program member. GHA member benefits are detailed on the GHA website www.gha.com. GHA is based in Switzerland.
The Participating Hotels use a reservation system that allows any of the Participating Hotels to view and access PGR Program member personal information on our system (for example to view past booking and transaction details for PGR Program members and confirm PGR Program member details and status). It is a condition of membership of the PGR Program that all members consent to the EVENT Group disclosing their personal information to all Participating Hotels listed on our website www.priorityguestrewards.com, including the Participating Hotels in foreign countries listed on that website, for the purpose of providing services or undertaking activities related to the PGR Program.
