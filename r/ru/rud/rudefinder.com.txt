We do our best to police the site for potential fraud and scam artists. We advise you to stop communicating with anyone that pressures you for personal or financial information; and
If you decide to meet face-to-face with another Member and/or Subscriber, you should always tell a close friend or family member where you are going and when you are expected to return.
