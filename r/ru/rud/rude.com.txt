Protecting the privacy and personal data of our visitors is important to us, and we are committed to collecting, maintaining, and securing your personal information in strict accordance with the principles described in this policy.
Throughout this policy, the term "You" or "Your" refers to you, the visitor providing information to Rude.com. The term "We", "Our" or "Website" refers to this website, Rude.com.
Collection of Information
In order to provide you with the highest level of service, we ask that you voluntarily provide us with certain information about yourself (collectively, your "Information"). Your Information includes, among other things, your name, your gender, your age, your physical location, your email address, and other information about yourself. Your Information may also include pictures and/or videos that your provide to the Website. Depending on how you participate at the Website, you also may be required to provide certain financial information to us.
Use of Information
Our privacy policy is simple: no one sees your Information unless (i) you want them to or, as described below, (ii) we have to share such information to comply with the law or to protect the Website.
For example, the information you voluntarily provide to us through your personal "My RudePage" is searchable by Website visitors. In addition, any pictures or videos that you upload to the Website is searchable by Website visitors. If you are unsure about how some of your Information is searchable by Website visitors, go to any random Website member's RudePage and take a look around.
We also may disclose your Information if we are required to do so by law or we in good faith believe that such action is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with legal process; (2) protect and defend our rights and property; (3) protect against misuse or unauthorized use of our website; or (4) protect the personal safety or property of our users or the public (among other things, this means that if you provide false information or attempt to pose as someone else, information about you may be disclosed as part of any investigation into your actions).
In addition, we may use the information we obtain from our members in the aggregate (with all personally identifiable information removed) for promotional purposes, or to determine our members' demographics and preferences. By doing so, we are able to deliver targeted advertisements on our website which you may find to be helpful and informative. Also, in the unlikely event that the Website, or substantially all of the Website's assets are acquired, your Information may be one of the transferred assets.
Unless otherwise specified, we reserve the right to keep a copy of your Information indefinitely, and use such information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.
