Sometimes there may be links on our web site that allow you to leave our site. We do not control the links or these web sites and we are not responsible for the contents of any linked site.

Third Party Collection of Information
We use a third party to serve ads on our behalf across the web sites and the Internet. The third party may also collect anonymous information about your visits to our web site. This is primarily accomplished through the use of a technology device, commonly referred to as a Web Beacon or an Action Tag, which we place on various web pages within our web site that allows the third party to collect anonymous information. The third party may use information about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide ads about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by the third party, click here. The third party reports the anonymous data that they collect on our behalf back to us, which we link to our customers' personally identifiable information for the purposes of better serving you. When we merge this data, it is treated under this policy as personally identifiable information as described above.
