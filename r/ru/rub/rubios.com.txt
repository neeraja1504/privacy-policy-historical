Name

E-mail address

Credit/Debit Card Information - only in encrypted form on secure servers
We need this information to provide you not only with the information that you've requested but also to let you know about additional services which you might want. We may also use this information to customize your experience using our website.
If you order a gift card and want it to be sent directly to the recipient, we will also ask you to submit information about someone other than you. In such situations, we will ask only for the recipient's name, address, telephone number and e-mail address.

We use this data in the aggregate to determine how much our customers use parts of our site so we can improve the customer experience on our site. We may provide this statistical information to third parties, but when we do so we do not provide personally identifying information without your permission.
