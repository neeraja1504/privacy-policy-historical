Privacy
Internet user privacy is of paramount importance to RushLane and its related sites. The success of our business depend upon our ability to maintain the trust of our users. Below is information regarding RushLane’s commitment to protect the privacy of users and to ensure the integrity of the Internet.
User Information
During your visit to the site, RushLane does not collect any personally-identifiable information about you that you do not specifically volunteer. This information may be volunteered when you create an account on the RushLane comment system. However, even then, RushLane does not use that stored information for any purpose other than to allow you to log in and post messages.
RushLane does, however, automatically collect certain non-personally-identifiable information about you, such as your browser type and the IP address that your ISP designates to your machine. This is standard practice for Web sites, and is not used for any purpose other than to monitor traffic evaluate how we can design the site to best serve your needs. This information is not sold to any third parties, nor is it available to anyone outside of the RushLane staff.
Cookies
RushLane, along with thousands of other Web sites, uses cookies to enhance your experience. Cookies are used in the RushLane comment system to keep track of your login information. Cookies can also store your user name and password so that you do not have to log in each time you want to post a message, though you must specifically request that this feature be turned on.
Cookie data is not stored on the server, and therefore, not available for viewing by RushLane staff or any third parties. However, it is possible that security flaws exist in some browsers that would allow other site administrators to write malicious scripts that would collect this data without RushLane’s knowledge, though this is quite unlikely.
