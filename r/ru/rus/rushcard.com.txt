UniRush is free to revise Website Privacy Policy at any time by updating this posting, and your use after such change signifies your acceptance of the changed terms.  Please check this Website Privacy Policy periodically for changes.
The Information We Collect
We collect both personal and non-personal information from you online.
For the purpose of this Website Privacy Policy, when we use the term “personal information” we mean information that is collected in conjunction with your name.  We typically collect such information by requesting that you complete an online application.  When we use the term “non-personal information” we mean information that is not collected in conjunction with your name.  We may use the following technologies to collect such information:
Cookies.  Many sites use “cookies,” which are small text files that reside on your computer to identify you as a unique user.  We may use cookies on our Sites to allow us to, among other things, measure activity and to personalize your experience.  For instance, cookies may enable us to remember your viewing preferences without requiring you to re-type a user name and password.  Cookies may also allow us to track your status or progress when requesting products, services, or information.  If you choose, you can set your browser to reject cookies or you can manually delete individual or all of the cookies on your computer by following your browser’s help file directions.  However, if your browser is set to reject cookies or you manually delete cookies, you may have some trouble accessing and using some of the pages and features that are currently on our Sites, or that we may put on our Sites in the future.
Web Beacons.  A web beacon is an electronic file on a Web page that allows us to count and recognize users who have visited that page.  Among other things, a web beacon can be used in HTML-formatted email to determine responses to our communications and measure their effectiveness.  You can generally avoid web beacons in email by turning off HTML display and displaying only the text portion of your email.
Internet Protocol (IP) Address.  As you enter our Sites, we capture and retain the IP address of the device you are using, such as a personal computer or a mobile device.
Location and Usage Information.  If you use our mobile application or access our website using a mobile device, we may collect information concerning your location, information about when an App is launched, individual session lengths for Apps, or why an App may not be working.
Do Not Track Header:  Some web browsers and devices permit you to broadcast a preference that you not be “tracked” online.  At this time we do not modify your experience based upon whether such a signal is broadcast.
How We Use Personal Information
Our primary purpose in collecting information about you is to provide you with products, services, and information that we think may be of interest to you.  We may also decide to use information about you to track how you use our Sites.  In addition, we may aggregate the information that you provide with the information that other users provide in order to conduct research, analysis, or studies for our own purposes (i.e., not related to providing you with specific products or services).
We may decide to send people who provide us with their email addresses email.  If you decide that you do not want to receive commercial emails from us, you can “opt-out” from receiving such emails by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link provided at the bottom of every commercial email.  Please note that if you choose to opt-out, we will still send you e-mail relating to specific products or services that you purchase, or e-mail that we believe is pertinent to any communication that you have sent to us, or relationship that you may have with us.  If you decide at a later time that you would like to receive commercial emails from us, you can re-add yourself to our communication list.
We may share personal information or non-personal information with other companies in the following situations:
Sharing Your Information with Service Providers.  We may share information with companies or individuals that provide us with services.  These services may include, among other things, helping us to provide services that you request, to create or maintain our databases, to research and analyze the people who request products, services or information from us, to prepare and distribute communications, or to respond to inquiries.  Any party with whom we share your personal information is required either contractually or by law to keep it confidential and not to disclose it without your consent and to only use such information as required for the services to be performed.
Other Companies: We may provide information to carefully selected outside companies when we believe their products or services may be of interest to you.
Law Enforcement and Legal Process.  We may disclose personal information to government and regulatory agencies to comply with a lawful summons, court order, subpoena, discovery request, fraud investigation, audit, regulatory examination or other valid court, government, or regulatory agency request.
Business Transition.  In the event that we, or any portion of our assets, are acquired your information may be transferred to the acquiring company.
Behavioral Advertisers.  We may participate in behavioral-based advertising.  This means that a third party may use technology, such as a cookie on your browser or a web beacon, to identify you on our Sites so that they can provide advertising about products and services tailored to your interest.  That advertising may appear either on our Sites, or on other websites.  If you would like to opt-out of behavioral advertising based on your use of our Sites, you can do so by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative at www.networkadvertising.org and the Digital Advertising Alliance at www.aboutads.info.
Other Websites.  Our Sites, e-mails, or applications may link to third parties’ websites.  It is also possible that third parties’ websites or e-mails may link to our Sites.  We are not responsible for the content or the privacy practices employed by third parties.  We encourage you to read the privacy policies of these websites before transmitting any personal identifiable information to third parties.
How We Secure Information
We use reasonable measures to help keep information secure, and to help prevent it from becoming disclosed to individuals who are not described in this Website Privacy Policy.  While we follow reasonable procedures to try to protect the information in our possession, no security system is perfect and we cannot promise, and you should not expect, that your information will remain secure in all circumstances.

* When you Direct Deposit $3,000 or more in combined tax refunds from the US Department of the Treasury or from your local or state tax agencies, you will receive a $30 account credit. When you Direct Deposit between $2,000 and $2,999 in combined tax refunds from the US Department of the Treasury or from your local or state tax agencies, you will receive a $20 account credit. If you Direct Deposit $2,000 - $2,999 and then later Direct Deposit an additional amount from the US Department of Treasury or from your local or state tax agencies which brings your total combined deposited tax refund amount to more than $3,000, you will receive an additional $10 account credit. Limit one offer per customer. Account will be credited within 30 days after qualifying deposit. The card account must be in good standing at the time the credit is given, meaning your RushCard is not dormant, blocked, revoked or closed. Offer is void where prohibited. Offer expires 5/15/2016. This optional offer is not a MetaBank product or service and MetaBank does not endorse it.
† Faster access to funds is based on comparison of a paper check versus electronic Direct Deposit.
Important information for opening a card account: To help the federal government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, the USA PATRIOT Act requires all financial institutions and their third parties to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens a card account. What this means for you: When you open a card account, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see your driver's license or other identifying documents.
Getting your money up to two days sooner is based on comparison of traditional banking policies and deposit of paper checks from employers and government agencies versus electronic direct deposits. Many employers and government agencies notify us of direct deposits before your "official" day scheduled for payment. If we receive early notice, we may load your direct deposit earlier than your "official" day scheduled for payment. We may limit the amount or type of Direct Deposit eligible for early loading.
There is no charge for Rush Text alerts; however, standard text message and data rates, fees, and charges may apply. Charges are dependent on your service plan, which may include fees from your carrier to send and receive text messages. Charges will appear on your wireless bill or be deducted from your prepaid phone balance. Message frequency will be determined by the alert options you select. For more information, refer to our RushTEXT terms under My Contact Preferences in the online account or text the word "HELP" to 697874 (MYRUSH). To unsubscribe, text the word "STOP" to 697874 (MYRUSH).

Your Prepaid Card account and associated direct deposit account number cannot be used for preauthorized direct debits from merchants or from utility or Internet service providers. If presented for payment, these preauthorized direct debits will be declined and your payment to the merchant or provider will not be processed. The bank routing number and direct deposit account number are for the purpose of initiating direct deposits to your Prepaid Card account only. You are not authorized to provide this bank routing number and direct deposit account number to anyone other than your employer or payer. Direct deposit capability is subject to payer’s support of this feature. Check with your payer to find out when the direct deposit of funds will start. Funds availability is subject to timing of payer’s funding.
"Out-of-network" refers to all ATMs outside of the MoneyPass ATM network. Certain fees including those assessed by the ATM owner/operator may apply. See Cardholder Agreement for complete details.
Subject to gas station’s terms, conditions, and limitations. The gas station may place a temporary hold on your available balance of up to $75 or more. The merchant will release the temporary hold when the transaction has been paid and replace it with the actual amount of your gasoline purchase. If applicable, the pump will automatically stop dispensing gasoline when the purchase reaches your card account balance (if you are on the Pay As You Go plan, the $1.00 Transaction Fee will be subtracted from your card account balance). To avoid this hold, pay inside and tell the cashier exactly how much you want to spend.

Through the Refer-a-Friend program, cardholders and a referred friend will receive a $20 load to their card accounts if the referred friend applies for a RushCard, activates and loads the card.
