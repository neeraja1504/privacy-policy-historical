Welcome to rue21’s privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) which forms a part of your legal agreement with us, together with our Terms of Use and any other terms and conditions which we notify you of when you use or attempt to use the Site.  PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY AS IT DESCRIBES HOW WE COLLECT AND USE INFORMATION AND UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES WE SHARE INFORMATION ABOUT YOU.
Any terms not defined in this Privacy Policy are defined in our Terms of Use.
1. Changes to Privacy Policy.  We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to modify, add or delete provisions of this Privacy Policy at any time and from time to time by updating or revising this posting and such revisions shall take effect as of the date of posting.  Your use of any of the Site after the effective date of any such change, means you accept and agree to be bound by the Privacy Policy, as modified. You should come back to this web page and review this Privacy Policy regularly so that you remain aware of the terms and conditions that apply to you.  If you are a registered user of the Site, we may, in our sole discretion, notify you by email of material changes to our Privacy Policy.
2. Non-Personal Information Collected and How Collected.  We and our operational service providers (as defined below) and others who host the Site often use technology that can recognize, collect and/or transmit information that is associated with you, but which do not personally identify you.  Although the term “cookie” specifically refers to a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes, for the purposes of this Privacy Policy, we will use the term “cookie” to refer generically to any technology that can recognize, collect and/or transmit information about your visits to the Site. This type of information includes such data as the Internet or web domain that referred you, the type of operating system and browser you are using, the date and time of your visit, data relating to activities on the Site (e.g., so-called ‘clickstream’ data) and other technological attributes about your visit to the Site. This information is used to analyze trends, administer the Site, track user movements on the Site and gather aggregate demographic information about visitors so we can continually improve the Site and your user experience.
Cookies also allow the Site to recognize a users’ computer or access device each time it is used to visit the Site and cookies can keep count of how often you return. Cookies can also track how you use the Site, your preferences for features and functions and, if you register for the Site, cookies can store information such as your e-mail address and password so you don’t have to re-enter them each time you return to visit.  Cookies don’t personally identify you or any particular user or individual.
We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“ Google"). Google Analytics uses cookies to help the Site analyze how users use the Site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the Site (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Site, compiling reports on Site activity for Site operators and providing other services relating to Site activity and internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf. Google may collect your IP address or other unique identifier for the device (computer, mobile phone, tablet or other device) you use to access the Site. We may use a device identifier to, among other things, to coordinate the content that we display to you across devices, including across mobile and web-based platforms, by making anonymous inferences about that device linkage. By using this Site, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner and for the purposes set out above. We may also use other similar analytic services.
You can disable or turn the cookie feature off by changing the settings on your Internet browser and you can also change the settings to stop your browser from automatically accepting cookies. Although changing these settings may not affect your ability to browse, it may affect your ability to use certain features and functions of the Site, for instance you will not be able to register for Promotions, and it may also require you to re-enter certain information each time you visit or attempt to use the Site. You should consult the operating instructions that apply to your browser to determine how to best configure your browser settings for your needs.
