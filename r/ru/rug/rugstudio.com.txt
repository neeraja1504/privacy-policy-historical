RugStudio: Privacy Policy
Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested. Additionally, the successful submission of an online order depends upon your submission of individually identifiable information. This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the RugStudio.com website (www.RugStudio.com). On some pages, you can order products, make requests, and register to receive information and materials. The types of personal information collected at these pages are Full name, Address, Email address, Phone number, Credit/Debit Card Information and Comments.
With your permission, we occasionally send you information about new products and services or offers that we feel may be of interest to you. We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order only to complete that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order. You can register with our website, or log in to your existing account if you would like to receive additional information or updates on our new products and services. We use the non-identifying and aggregate information to help design a better website for your shopping convenience.
Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. Cookies are small packets of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Our cookies do not collect personally identifying information, nor are they associated with any information that could be used to identify you. We use cookies to provide features such as Search and Shopping Cart functions. These 'cookies' are common with websites and are necessary for the secure shopping cart to function properly.
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. When you place orders or access your account information, we use a secure server. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all information you input before sending it to us. All customer data we collect is protected against unauthorized access.
Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13. You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain by contacting us directly, as described below. We use this procedure to safeguard your information better. You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by sending us a request that credibly shows error. To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections. Should you have other questions or concerns about these privacy policies, please feel free tocontact us.
