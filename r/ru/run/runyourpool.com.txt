Information We Collect
(1) Site Activity Data
Each time a visitor comes to this website, our web server collects and logs certain information. These access logs are kept for a reasonable period of time. These logs include, but are not restricted to your username (if applicable), date, and time. These logs are used solely for performance, site administration and security reviews.

(3) Personal Information
Personal information, such as your name and email address is collected only when you voluntarily provide it when creating or joining a pool. Unlike many sites, we collect as little personal information possible, just that information required to provide our services.
The personal information you provide is accessible only to your pool administrator, and to site administrators (staff at RunYourPool.com). Your name may be made visible to other members of your private pool by your pool administrator. Your email address may, on rare occasion, be used to send you information and updates pertaining to your account (e.g. password recovery, important notifications related to your pool, etc).
Personal information will not be sold to any third parties, nor will such information be added to bulk email lists.
