** 2.5. Google Analytics**
This website uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (“ Google” ). Google Analytics uses cookies (see section 2.5) to enable an analysis of your use of the website. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website is usually transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there. However, Google will reduce your IP address within member states of the European Union or in other signatory states to the Agreement on the European Economic Area beforehand and thus make it anonymous. Only in exceptional cases the full IP address will be transferred to a Google server in the USA and shortened there.
On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity and to provide the website operator with other services relating to website and internet use. The IP address transmitted by your browser in the context of Google Analytics is not merged with other Google data.
You can prevent the storage of cookies by a corresponding setting of your browser software ) or a privacy plug-in (see section 2.5). You can also prevent Google from collecting the data generated by the cookie and relating to your use of the website (including your IP address) and from processing this data by Google by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available under the following link (http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en).
Further information on data protection at Google Analytics can be found at: https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/.
Google is certified under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, which ensures the level of protection of natural persons guaranteed by GDPR is not undermined through data transfers (https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&status=Active).
** 2.6. Google Double-Click (including Floodlight and Spotlight), Google AdWords Conversion, Google Dynamic Remarketing**
We use Google Analytics to evaluate data from the Google services AdWords and DoubleClick for statistical purposes. In order to improve our offers, we can analyse what happens after a user clicks on our ad, e.g. whether the user has bought our product or accessed the ad from a mobile phone. You will also receive interest-based advertising through these services. Their consent is required for this (see section 2.5). If you do not wish this, you can prevent this, in addition to the variant described in section 2.5, using Google's Ads Preferences Manager: http://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/?hl=en.
DoubleClick places a cookie on your computer to record your surfing behaviour on various websites (tracking) and to play out interest-related advertising. If you do not want this to happen permanently, you can download a plug-in from the following link to prevent the DoubleClick cookie: https://www.google.com/settings/u/0/ads/plugin?hl=en or you can proceed as described in section 2.5.

** 2.7. Google Tag Manager**
This website uses Google Tag Manager to manage website tags. A tag is a JavaScript snippet used to send information from a website to recipients, in particular in the context of web tracking. The Google Tag Manager tool itself does not collect any personal data. The tool triggers other tags that may collect data (e.g. the Google Analytics tag). Google Tag Manager does not access this data. If deactivation has been made at the domain or cookie level, it will remain in effect for all tracking tags implemented with Google Tag Manager. This makes it easier to effectively implement your need against tracking procedures.

** 2.8. Google Fonts**
Our website uses "Google Fonts" from Google to display fonts uniformly. When you call up a website, your browser loads the required fonts into your browser cache to display texts and fonts correctly. Among other things, your IP address is transferred to the Google servers. If your browser does not support Google Fonts, standard fonts are used.
For more information about Google Fonts, please visit https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq and read Google's privacy policy.

** 2.9. reCAPTCHA**
To protect your requests via contact form we use the service reCAPTCHA of the company Google. The query serves to differentiate whether the input is made by a person or abusively by automated, machine processing. The query includes sending the IP address and any other data required by Google for the reCAPTCHA service to Google. For this purpose your input will be transferred to Google and used there. However, Google will previously reduce your IP address within member states of the European Union or in other states party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transferred to a Google server in the USA and shortened there.
On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of this service. The IP address transferred by your browser within the scope of reCAPTCHA will not be merged with other Google data. The deviating data protection regulations of the company Google apply to this data. For further information on data protection at Google, please refer to Google's privacy policy.

** 2.10. Google Maps**
On the page of the contact form there is a plugin which shows a map of Google Maps. Google Maps is a web service for displaying interactive (country) maps in order to display geographical information visually. Using this service will show you our location and make it easier for you to find us.
This is done by connecting your browser to Google's servers as if you were visiting the Google search engine's website. If you are logged into Google, your information will be directly linked to your account. If you do not wish to be linked to your profile on Google, you must log out before activating the button. Google is responsible for data processing by Google. There is no tracking by Google on our website.
If you do not agree to the future transfer of your data to Google in the context of the use of Google Maps, it is also possible to completely deactivate the Google Maps web service by switching off the JavaScript application in your browser. Google Maps and therefore also the map display on this website can then not be used.
For more information about using Google Maps, please see the Google Maps Terms of Use. For further information on data protection at Google, please refer to Google's privacy policy.

** 3.5. Google SDK (Firebase Analytics)**
We use the developer platform called "Google Firebase" as well as the associated functions and services of Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA ( Google ). Google Firebase is a platform for developing apps for mobile devices and websites. Google Firebase offers a variety of features, which can be found on the following website: https://firebase.google.com/products/.
The analysis of user interactions is carried out using the analysis service of Firebase Analytics. This service helps us to record your interactions. Events such as the first time an app is opened, the uninstalling of an app, updates, crashes or the frequency of use of the app are recorded. Certain user interests are also recorded and evaluated.
The information processed by Google Firebase about your use of this app is usually transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there. However, Google will reduce your IP address within member states of the European Union or in other signatory states to the Agreement on the European Economic Area beforehand and thus make it anonymous. Only in exceptional cases the full IP address will be transferred to a Google server in the USA and anonymized there. The data may also be used with other Google services, such as Google Analytics and Google marketing services. In this case, only pseudonymous information, such as the Android Advertising ID or the Advertising Identifier for iOS, will be processed to identify users' mobile devices. Additional information on the use of data for marketing purposes by Google can be found on the following website: https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads.
The legal basis for this use is Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. If you wish to object to interest-based advertising through Google marketing services, you can use the settings options provided by Google: http://www.google.com/ads/preferences.
Further information on data protection at Google can be found at: https://policies.google.com/?hl=en.
Google is certified under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, which ensures the level of protection of natural persons guaranteed by GDPR is not undermined through data transfer. (https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&status=Active).
