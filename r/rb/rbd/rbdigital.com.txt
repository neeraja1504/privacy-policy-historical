WHAT INFORMATION DOES RECORDED BOOKS INC. COLLECT?
We gather information about you (your “Personal Information”) so that We can provide you with
the RBdigital Services, and improve and personalize your experience with RBdigital. Personal
Information that We collect falls into the following primary categories.
I NFORMATION THAT YOU G IVE U S
We receive and store the information that you enter at the Site or give to us in any other way off
line. For example, We collect the information that you provide when you create an account for
RBdigital – this means at minimum, your name, email address, and library card number. We may
also receive the same or similar Personal Information from your library to verify you are properly
eligible to use the RBdigital Services (as described below).
We also collect information you provide when you fill out the information in any “contact us”
form on the Site.
We collect the minimum data set that allows us to deliver the RBdigital Services you choose to
use and to assist you through Customer Support if you request it. If you engage our Customer
Support team they may collect your phone number and other information specific to resolving
your issue.
You can always choose not to provide some or all of the information We ask for, but this may
prevent you from receiving information or obtaining certain services that you desire.
Our service partners may collect additional information in the process of creating your account
on their sites. You control the information you give Recorded Books and our service partners.
A UTOMATIC I NFORMATION & C OOKIES :
Whenever you interact with the Site, We receive and store certain types of information. For
example, We use “Session Storage” or "cookies" to store information when your web browser
accesses the Site. We use Session Storage if permitted by your browser. Session Storage is
temporary browser storage. We use information stored there to enhance your browsing
experience at RBdigital.com. Session storage is deleted when you logout or in 30 days whichever
comes first. If session storage is not permitted by your browser, we use a cookie to store session
information. A cookie is an alphanumeric identifier, which We transfer to your computer via your
Web browser and store on your computer's hard drive. The cookie file allows us to recognize
your computer when you visit the Site. On most web browsers, you can control how cookies
work. You will find a "help" section on the browser toolbar. Please refer to this section for
information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie, and how to
turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they will enable you
to take advantage of some of the Site’s best features.

This Site uses cookies to log IP addresses, browser types, track where a user came from, where a
user goes on our Site, most popular pages, least popular pages, and other similar types of
information for systems administration purposes.
The information gathered via these cookies does not directly identify any individual visitor.
However, it may render such visitors “indirectly identifiable”. This is because the information
collected is typically linked to a pseudonymous identifier associated with the device you use to
access our Site.
Log files associated with these and other Site processes are kept for no more than 60 days.

information of that user in order to respond to that inquiry.

the section entitled Information that you Give Us:. We only process this Personal Information to:

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR EUROPEAN UNION USERS
T HE EU G ENERAL D ATA P ROTECTION R EGULATION (“GDPR”)
The GDPR is a data protection regulation of the European Union. It came into force May 25,
2018. The GDPR is relevant to Recorded Books, Inc. because We process the Personal
Information of individuals who are based in the European Economic Area (“Europe”) in the
context of making available the RBdigital Services to such persons.
This Privacy Policy is intended to meet our duties of transparency under the GDPR.
In particular, We want to make it clear to you what rights you have and how you can exercise
them. These are described in Your Rights in this document.
W HAT IS ‘ PERSONAL DATA ’ UNDER THE GDPR?
The GDPR definition of ‘personal data’ can be found here. Essentially, it means: information
about an individual, from which that individual is either directly identified or can be indirectly
identified.
It does not include anonymous information (i.e., information where the identity of individual has
been permanently removed). However, it does include ‘indirect identifiers’ or ‘pseudonymous
data’ (i.e., information which alone doesn’t identify an individual but, when combined with
certain additional and reasonably accessible information, could be attributed to a particular
individual). For example, certain of the technical information that We automatically collect when
you use the Site may constitute pseudonymous personal data by which you could indirectly be
identified.
To the extent it meets the definition in GDPR, each reference to how We deal with your
‘Personal Information’ or ‘personally identifiable information’ in this Privacy Policy should, for
users based in Europe, be read as a reference to personal data.
W HO IS THE C ONTROLLER OF YOUR P ERSONAL I NFORMATION ?
Recorded Books is a “Controller” of your Personal Information for purposes of the GDPR. In
addition, the library of which you are a member, will also have access to, and be a Controller of,
your Personal Information. This is because, depending on the context, we both determine the
purposes and means of how your Personal Information is used.
For our details, see How to Contact Recorded Books, Inc. above for contact details.
If you want to know how your library handles your Personal Information, you should check its
privacy policy.
O UR EU R EPRESENTATIVE
As noted above, We are not based in the European Union. For this reason, We have appointed a
representative based in the European Union, to whom you can address any issues or queries you
might have relating to our processing of your Personal Information and/or this Privacy Policy.
Our EU representative is: W.F. Howes, Ltd. To contact W.F. Howes, Ltd. Use the information
below.

Y OUR R IGHTS
The GDPR gives you certain rights regarding your Personal Information. You may ask us to take
the following actions in relation to your Personal Information that we hold:
•    Opt-out. Stop sending you direct marketing communications. You may continue to receive
service-related and other non-marketing emails.

your Personal Information that impacts your rights.
You can submit these requests by email to yoursupport@recordedbooks.com or our postal
address provided above. We may request specific information from you to help us confirm your
identity and process your request. Applicable law may require or permit us to decline your
request. If we decline your request, we will tell you why, subject to legal restrictions. If you
would like to submit a complaint about our use of your Personal Information or response to your
requests regarding your Personal Information, you may contact us as described above or submit
a complaint to the data protection regulator in your jurisdiction. You can find your data
protection regulator here.
In addition, if you desire to review your own Personal Information, visit your patron profile page
on the Site. From your profile page you can:
•   View and download the information we keep for you
•   Edit your personal information
•   Change the email address associated with your account
•   Request that we permanently forget your information.
A BOUT O UR F ORGET M E P ROCESS :
We honor your request to be “forgotten” immediately. We delete your information from our
systems and notify our Partners of your request as well. They will “forget” your information upon
receiving our request. We will send you a final confirmation email after which your personal
information will be gone from our client-facing systems and we will no longer be able to locate
your records or contact you. These steps take approximately one business day. The final traces of
your information in logs, backups, etc. will be overwritten through automated processes in less
than 60 days.]
Recorded Books Inc. reserves the right to maintain your Personal Information if Recorded Books
Inc. has suspended, limited, or terminated your access to our Site for violating the Recorded
Books Inc. Terms of Use, as necessary to comply with applicable law.
O UR L EGAL B ASIS FOR PROCESSING YOUR P ERSONAL I NFORMATION .
•   We only use your Personal Information as permitted by the GDPR. The GDPR requires us to
ensure that we have a “legal basis” for each way in which we use your Personal Information.
We are also required to inform you of each such legal basis for our processing of your
Personal Information, these are described in the table below.
•   If you have questions about the legal basis of how we process your Personal Information,
contact us.
•   Please note that where we rely on “legitimate interests” as the legal basis for our processing.
We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and
negative) and your rights before we process your Personal Information for our legitimate
interests. This means that, We have made an assessment that the nature and extent of our
use of your Personal Information is necessary for our legitimate interests and your own
interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests that We are pursuing.
Purpose:            What this means:                           Legal basis:

or demographic data) for any purpose.
Anonymous Data may be derived from
your Personal Information, but once in
aggregated form it will not constitute
‘personal data’ for the purposes of the
GDPR as this data does not directly or
indirectly reveal your identity.
W HAT H APPENS W HEN Y OU D O N OT P ROVIDE N ECESSARY P ERSONAL I NFORMATION ?
Where you fail to provide Personal Information that we need to process based on Contractual
Necessity or for the purposes of Compliance with Law, we may not be able to perform the
contract we have or are trying to enter into with you (for example, we may not be able to open
your account, we may have to close your account etc.)
U SE F OR N EW P URPOSES
We may use your Personal Information for reasons not described in this Privacy Policy where
permitted by law and the reason is compatible with the purpose for which we collected it. If we
need to use your Personal Information for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and explain
the applicable legal basis.
R ETENTION
We will only retain your Personal Information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we
collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting
requirements.
To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Information, we consider the
amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Information, the potential risk of harm from
unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Information, the purposes for which we process
your Personal Information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means,
and the applicable legal requirements.
We also consider the inconvenience to you and your library should we delete your account due
to inactivity. Our policy for retaining the personal information used to maintain your Site account
is that accounts dormant for a three-year period will be closed and the user/patron forgotten.
Accounts showing activity will be maintained until otherwise requested by you or your library or
until you library ceases to engage Recorded Books, Inc. for services.
In some circumstances we may create Anonymous Data from your Personal Information (so that
it can no longer be associated with you) in which case we may use this Anonymous Data
indefinitely without further notice to you.
P ERSONAL I NFORMATION FROM T HIRD P ARTY S OURCES
In addition to the Personal Information that we collect directly from you, we may also collect
your Personal Information from third party sources. Please note that none of these third party
sources are generally available to the public.
As examples, we may receive your Personal Information from the library you are registered with,
as well as our Partners and Agents.
T RANSFERS OF P ERSONAL I NFORMATION TO ENTITIES BASED OUTSIDE E UROPE
We are a U.S.-based company. Although We do not have an establishment within Europe, as
noted above, the GDPR is relevant to us and our use of Personal Information of individuals
located in Europe. For this reason, We take appropriate steps to ensure that when We process
such Personal Information (despite the fact that We are not based in Europe) We do so in
accordance with the GDPR.
In addition, where We transfer Personal Information of individuals located in Europe to any of
the third parties outlined above, We take steps to ensure that We have implemented
appropriate safeguards to provide that such protection is maintained and is not undermined as a
result of that disclosure. This typically means that we endeavor to provide that all our partners
with whom we share your Personal Information (see here) are bound by contractual provisions
that establish appropriate safeguards for your Personal Information (including provision that
Your Rights are still effectively enforceable).
