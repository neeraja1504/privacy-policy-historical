WHAT PERSONAL DATA DO WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU?
PROPERTIES ADVERTISED ON THE SITE
What we collect and where it comes from |
In the course of providing our services, we collect property data such as images of properties, property asking prices, sales history and sold prices, property addresses, property locations and property descriptions.
The property data is provided to us by our members or other third parties on behalf of those members.
Why we collect it |
We will use this information for a number of reasons including:
to provide the Rightmove Site;
to enable our members to advertise their properties to the largest online audience available;
to enable potential purchasers or tenants to see detailed descriptions and images of properties that they may be interested in;
to allow users to see current property trends such as the prices of houses for sale in their local area; and
for our own commercial purposes such as to identify trends in the property market, automated survey and valuation tools, and to build property databases.
Our lawful basis for processing this personal data |
We have a legitimate interest to process this information. These legitimate interests are:
providing a service to our members by helping them to market properties;
providing a service to our members by advertising properties to potential purchasers or tenants;
providing a service to potential purchasers and tenants so that they know what properties are currently on the market and the price of those properties; and
to provide data services to third parties such as banks, building societies, insurance companies and other financial institutions so that they can process this property data for their purposes, including using the data in services such as property valuation models or surveyor comparison software.
How long we will keep it for |
We will stop advertising a property when we are instructed to do so by our members.
However, the property information will remain available on the Site as historical property information to allow users to benefit from services such as identifying previous for sale or sold prices (please see the historical property data section below for further information).
HISTORICAL PROPERTY DATA

If a property has previously been actively marketed on the Site, we will continue to display it on the Site as historical property information. If you have any concerns about any historical property information available on the Site, please see the section of this Policy entitled "Removing Property Data from the Site" (below).
We also have data that relates to historical property listings on the Site which we collect from other third parties. For example, we obtain the sold prices of the properties from the Land Registry (or the Land Register of Scotland) and display those sold prices on the Site
Why we collect it |
We will use this information:
to assist potential purchasers and tenants when forming a view about historical market trends and potential property values;
to assist vendors when researching the approximate value of their property;
to enable users to see detailed property descriptions and images of properties in areas that they may be interested in;
to allow users to see property trends that they may be interested in, such as the previous sale and sold prices of houses in their local area; and
for our other commercial purposes, such as to identify trends in the property market and automated survey and valuation tools, and to build property databases.

How long we will keep it for | To the extent that property data is also personal data, it is generally the case that it ceases to be personal data over time. The historic property data is retained by us in accordance with our property database and remains necessary in order for us to provide the services summarised in the "why we collect it" box.
