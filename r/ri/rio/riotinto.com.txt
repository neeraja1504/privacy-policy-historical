6. Questions and contact information
1. Processing of personal data
Whose personal data does Rio Tinto process?
Rio Tinto processes personal data of individuals with whom it deals in the course of its business activities.
This includes "contact people" within:
its customers and suppliers;
government departments and regulatory agencies;
the communities where it operates; and
industry groups and other organisations that it has business dealings with.
As explained in the introduction, Rio Tinto also processes personal data of employees, prospective employees and contractors, and more information about that is contained in the separate privacy statements referred to above. Rio Tinto also processes personal data of its shareholders and directors.
What type of personal data is processed, and why?
Rio Tinto processes personal data that it needs for its business activities. The scope of your personal data that is processed will depend on the nature of Rio Tinto's dealings with you. We process personal data as we consider required or as permitted by applicable Privacy Laws.
If you are one of the "contact people" described above, Rio Tinto will process personal data that is needed to contact you or your organisation. Apart from your name, Rio Tinto will process your business contact details (egg title, work address, email address and telephone numbers).
This personal data will be processed for the relevant business purposes for which it was collected or obtained, for example to supply goods to your company or acquire services from your company, to enter into contracts, for external communications and for related administrative purposes.
Rio Tinto may also need to process other types of information in order to manage your relationship with Rio Tinto. In particular, we need to process personal data:
about individuals within our customers in order to take actions or measures we consider necessary or appropriate to comply with our legal obligations. For example, to meet our obligations under anti-money laundering legislation in some of our countries of operation, we need to process personal data that verifies the identity of beneficial owners of customers (egg passport data). We also need to collect personal data from shareholders for shareholding purposes (including for regulatory reporting  and shareholder communications); and
about visitors to our premises or sites for security and safety purposes.
In these situations, if you do not provide the personal data we need or request, we won't be able to do business with you (or the company that you represent).
2. Will personal data be shared?
Sharing of personal data within the Rio Tinto Group
To the extent we consider required or permitted by applicable Privacy Laws, personal data may be shared between companies within the Rio Tinto Group as necessary or appropriate for the conduct of business activities (as described in section 1 above).
Rio Tinto operates globally. This means that Rio Tinto companies may be located in a country which does not afford the same level of protection as your country or where your personal data may be accessible by law enforcement, government, regulatory or national security authorities. The sharing of personal data within the Rio Tinto Group is governed by the terms of the Rio Tinto Data Transfer Deed, which incorporates the European Commission's standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data. The Rio Tinto Data Transfer Deed is intended to ensure that personal data transfers are adequately protected for the purposes of applicable Privacy Laws that restrict transfers across national borders.
Disclosures of personal data to third parties
To the extent permitted by applicable Privacy Laws, Rio Tinto may disclose personal data:
to external service providers (as discussed below);
in the event of a proposed sale, merger, reorganisation or other similar event relating to a Rio Tinto business or entity;
as we consider required or permitted under law or to comply with legal or regulatory requirements. This may require disclosures to courts, law enforcement agencies or government, regulatory or other competent authorities and bodies; or
to protect the rights or safety of any of its employees or any third party.
Sometimes Rio Tinto engages external service providers (including professional advisers such as lawyers, accountants and auditors) to fulfil some of Rio Tinto's functions or to perform other important services (egg IT functions, data storage services, share registry services). In that context, personal data may be disclosed to those external service providers.
Rio Tinto's external service providers (including external professional advisers) may be located in a country which does not have laws that provide the same level of data protection as in your country. Rio Tinto takes contractual steps to protect the confidentiality and security of your personal data when it is disclosed to external service providers (including, where necessary, execution of the European Commission's standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data). We also require external service providers to process your personal data only in accordance with Rio Tinto's instructions and applicable data privacy laws.
3. Individual rights
You have a right to seek access to the personal data that Rio Tinto holds about you (subject to some exceptions under applicable Privacy Laws).
You also have the right to ask us to update or correct your personal information when it is inaccurate, incomplete or out of date, and in some instances, you can request that we cease to process your personal data (for example, if the processing causes you damage or distress).
If you wish to exercise these rights, you can contact your local Rio Tinto office, or email us. You will be referred to the data privacy co-ordinator for the relevant Rio Tinto business unit. The data privacy co-ordinator will provide you with an access request form (or other relevant form) to complete (so that we can respond to your request efficiently). We will assume (unless you tell us otherwise) that your request relates to our current records about you. These current records will include personal data about you which is included in our databases and in paper files (and which we may use on a day to day basis).
Generally, we will act upon your requests for access to your personal data free of charge. However, Rio Tinto reserves the right to charge you an appropriate fee or to ask you to reimburse it for reasonable costs associated with retrieving, copying or providing access to your data (if this is permitted under applicable Privacy Laws).
You can also help us to keep your personal data up to date by notifying us if your business contact details change.
4. Online privacy - processing of personal data collected through Rio Tinto websites
This section of the Privacy Statement describes how Rio Tinto processes personal data that is collected or obtained through this website.
