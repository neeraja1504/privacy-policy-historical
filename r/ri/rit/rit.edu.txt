Your data protection rights
If you are an EU resident, you may request access to, rectification, erasure or restriction of processing of your personal data, subject to applicable EU law. You may also have the right to object to processing or request data portability and request a copy of the personal data that we hold about you.
For any of the above requests, please send a description of your personal data stating your name, your date of birth and your place of birth as proof of identity to the contact details below. We may require additional proof of identity to protect your personal data against unauthorized access. We will carefully consider your request and may discuss with you how it can best be fulfilled.
If you have given us your consent for the processing of your personal data you can withdraw the consent at any time with future effect, i.e. the withdrawal of the consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on the consent before its withdrawal.

If you are not satisfied with our response or believe we are processing your personal data not in accordance with the law you can complain to the competent data protection supervisory authority in your country.
Are you required to provide personal data?
As a general principle, you voluntarily provide us with your personal data. However, in certain circumstances we are required to collect certain personal data for legal purposes, for example because this personal data is required to be able to complete a contractual relationship, including your education or for other Services. In these cases, if you do not provide us with your personal information, we may be unable to provide you Services such as, but no limited to, administering your application/enrollment, assign certain tasks to you or permit you to participate in certain activities or services offered in connection with your studies or other interactions with RIT.
How long do we store personal data?
If you are an EU resident, RIT will delete your personal data when it is no longer reasonably required for business purposes or you withdraw your consent (where applicable), provided that we are not legally required or otherwise permitted to continue storing such data. RIT will not delete your personal data where it may be retained for the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes. Please refer to our data retention policies for further details.
