Make Sure Your Order Qualifies
Pillows, personalized orders, and made-to-order frames are not eligible for returns.

Orders may be returned so long as:
* The order is new, unused/unworn, and in the original packaging
* The order is returned within 15 days of receipt
* The order was not purchased on final sale
Return Your Order & Packing Slip
With the exception of rugs and wallpaper, please send your order and its original packing slip, to:
RIFLE PAPER CO.
Attn: Returns
140 Atlantic Drive

Any order returned to the wrong address (i.e. the address not provided in the return form) will incur a rerouting fee subtracted from the refund.
If you are looking to make an exchange for an item of equal or lesser value, please note which item(s) you would like to receive on your original packing slip.
Please keep the tracking number and any other relevant shipping information in the unlikely event we do not receive your return shipment.
Await Credit
Once a qualified return is received we will process your refund as soon as possible. The charges placed on your card will be credited to you, excluding non-refundable shipping costs. Rugs are subject to a restocking fee.
Please note refunds may take up to ten (10) business days to show on your account due to varying processing times between payment providers. If for any reason you do not receive the credited amount within that time frame, please feel free to contact us.
Shipping / Payment
Shipping & Fulfillment
Rifle Paper Co. currently ships all orders with either FedEx or USPS from our shipping and fulfillment warehouse in Maitland, FL  with the exception of a few items. Rugs and pillows will ship from Dallas, TX and wallpaper will ship from Hudson, WI.
International Shipping
We currently offer FedEx options for international orders. Rifle Paper Co. is not responsible for any customs fees or duties incurred on international shipments as these are the responsibility of the purchaser. We strongly recommend using International First or Priority methods if you need your package to arrive in a time sensitive manner. Please note, however, even with these shipping methods, transit times may vary due to customs delays. International Standard, while an affordable method, may vary in transit time and reliability depending on your own country's postal system.
At this time, we are only able to ship rugs and pillows to the United States, US Territories, and Canada.
Rug Shipping & Restocking Fees
Each rug in your order ship individually and incur its own shipping fee. Should you wish to return your rug, an equal restocking fee will apply. Please note, return shipping costs will be the responsibility of the customer.
Domestic shipping and restocking fees are:
Over $900 | $75
---|---
$250–$900 | $35
$75–$250 | $15
Up to $75 | $10
Signature required upon delivery for all rug orders excluding PO Boxes and APO/FPO. At this time, we are only able to ship rugs and pillows to the United States, US Territories, and Canada.
Personalized Order Processing
Personalized orders typically take about 2–3 weeks to process and ship. If your order is time sensitive please contact us before placing your order. If you order additional store products they will be shipped at the same time as the personalized goods. Please see the product descriptions for more information.
Lost Packages
If you have a package that was marked as delivered but you have not yet received it, we ask you take the following steps:
Check with your neighbors or front office (if applicable) to see if the package was left there
Reach out to your local post office or FedEx facility.
Contact our team at help@riflepaperco.com and include your order number.
We kindly ask that you report your lost or stolen shipment within 10 days of the marked delivery date. If an order is lost after being shipped to a third party mail forwarding facility, we are unable to assume responsibility of the package once it is marked as delivered. Once an international shipment has been marked as ‘delivered,’ we are no longer responsible for the particular package.
Please note, Rifle Paper Co. is not responsible for refunding or reshipping lost orders due to an incorrect address at checkout.
