Information Collection
The city does not collect personal information about visitors to the website unless the visitor chooses to provide that information.
The city collects limited non-personally identifying information browsers make available automatically whenever someone visits a website. This information includes the Internet Address of the computer or network, the date, time, and page visited, the browser and operating system, and the referring page (the last webpage visited before clicking on a link to the city's website).
The city uses the aggregated information from all visitors to measure server performance; analyze user traffic patterns; and improve the content of the city's website.
The city tracks the keywords that are entered into the search engine to measure interest in specific topics, but that information is not linked to a specific visitor.
Some on-line services require visitors to register for an account, which requires entry of some personal information in order to create the account (typically the visitor's name, email address, and a password for account access). For certain services, such as online tax payment services, it may be necessary to provide credit card or other payment information which may be stored temporarily in encrypted form on secure servers but not with the city. All online credit card transactions are handled by third party Software as a Service (SaaS) providers.
