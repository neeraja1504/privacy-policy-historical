Privacy
Commission River, Inc. ("RiverOffers.com" or "we" or "us") uses this web site to run an affiliate marketing network over the World Wide Web (the "Web"). Even though Many portions of this web site are accessible and viewable by the general public, not all visitors may use our program. Each Commission River program is available for use only by persons or entities that join the network as either an "Affiliate" (Publisher), an "Advertiser" (Vendor), or "Strategic Partner" (Private Labeled Licensee).
Information About Affiliates
When we receive a request to become a Commission River affiliate, that information is not shared with any third party for any reason. That information is used strictly for login security (when the affiliate accesses their password protected back office), tracking the sign up of new customers, and for payment of commissions. All affiliates have the ability to apply for all advertising programs offered without their individual information being shared in any way with our advertising partners.
Information About Advertisers
Commission River advertisers are required to submit their contact and billing information to us when they apply to become listed in our program. Once approved, the Commission River team will build their products and/or services into our program and make them available to the community of affiliates. Commission River sends all new customer information (generated by affiliate traffic) directly to these advertisers for provisioning. Once the transaction in complete, the advertiser will pay Commission River for the sale. Commission River, in turn, pays the affiliate. The customer's private information never leaves this information loop.
Information About Customers
After you order a product you will receive an automated confirmation email. You will never receive any general newsletter or other form of unsolicited mail that does not relate to your Telecom services purchase. Your information will not be shared, sold, rented, or traded with third parties for their promotional purposes.
