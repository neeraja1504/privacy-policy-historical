Privacy Policy - Ridesharing Driver
Privacy Policy
This page contains information on how we receive and your personal information when you use and visit RidesharingDriver.com, and how we keep your information safe.
Definitions
The definitions which follow are meant only for convenience. This privacy polity may change without notice.
RidesharingDriver (referred to as “Our”, “Us” and/or “We”) owns and operates a website at RidesharingDriver.com (hereinafter collectively referred to as the “Site”).
“You” and/or “Your” refers to the visitor, customer, or member using the Site (whether that person is an individual or business entity and whether said person or entity is using the Site for personal or commercial purposes).
We may use “Personally Identifiable Information” (name, email address, street address, telephone number, IP address) subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy and applicable laws.
How we gather and store information from you
How We collect and store information depends on the page You are visiting, the activities in which You elect to participate, and the services provided. For example, You may be asked to provide personal information such as your first and last name, email address and/or telephone number when You register for access to certain portions of the Site or request certain features, (such as Our newsletter) or when You make a purchase.  You may provide information when you participate in any of Our programs (such as the RideSharingDriver Affiliate Program) on or by the Site and other interactive areas of the Site.
We also collect information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to You. For example, We may log the name of your Internet Service Provider or your IP address, or use information available through the Internet, cookie technology, other forms of technology, and technologies yet to be conceived and/or implemented, to recognize You and hold information from your visit. Among other things, these technologies, in whole or in part and in any possible combination, may store Your username and password, sparing You from having to re-enter that information each time You visit, identify your account number, or may control the number of times You encounter a particular advertisement while visiting the Sites, or be used to Our advantage to market products and services on behalf of Us or Our Advertisers, or in any other way We see fit.
As we adopt additional technology, We may also gather additional types and categories of information about You and Your use of the Site, its Programs or Products, Your use of the Internet, and/or Your implied topics of interest, usage, or research, and do this through other means.
What we do with the information we collect
Like other web services, We collect information to formulate lists of topics, categories of interest and/or use, and Your implied specific areas of interest. This may be used to enhance Your visit, deliver more individualized content and advertising, to secure Our database(s), or to protect Us from illicit usage of the Site. We respect Your privacy and do not share Your information with anyone outside of Our organization and any subsidiaries, affiliates, partners, and other entities with whom We may have an ongoing business relationship. Additionally, real time transmission of the information may occur to affect, enable, or enhance other programs and services.
Aggregate Information (information that does not personally identify You) may be used in many ways. For example, We may combine information about Your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to help enhance the Sites and the services offered therein (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or what features are most attractive).
Aggregate Information may occasionally be shared with or sold to RideSharingDriver’s licensees, subsidiaries, Affiliates, advertisers, and/or business partners. Again, this information does not include any Personally Identifiable Information about You or information that would allow anyone to identify You individually. Additionally, periodic transmission of the aggregate information may occur to affect, enable, or enhance other programs and services.
We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected by and/or retained on the Sites or through any of Our Affiliates’ links, to communicate with You about Your registration and customization preferences; Our Terms of Use (aka License/Terms and Conditions (of Use)/Terms of Service), this Privacy Policy, or any other legal documents contained on the Sites or any other legal documents which pertain to Your participation; services and products offered, now or in the future, by RideSharingDriver; or any other topics We think you might find of interest.  Any such communication may be in the form of email, or any other means suitable to the type of communication, including any new information delivery technologies that might become available.
Personally Identifiable Information collected by and/or retained on the Sites or through any of Our Affiliates’ links, may also be used for other purposes, including but not limited to administration of the Site, troubleshooting, and other communications with You.
Certain third parties who provide technical support for the operation of the Sites (our Web hosting service for example), in general, may access such information. We will use Your information only as permitted by law. In addition, from time to time, as We continue to develop Our business, We may sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, Your user information may be among the transferred assets. We may also disclose Your information in response to a court order, at other times when We believe We are reasonably required to do so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts You may owe to Us, and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever We deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note We may not provide You with notice prior to, or after, disclosure in such cases.
Occasionally RideSharingDriver is approached by companies and professional associations seeking to inform Our Members, Participants, Purchasers, and Affiliates, about products or services that may be of interest to them. We review these requests and when, in Our judgment, We think the information would be of benefit to these persons or entities, We cooperate in getting You this information. We view receiving such information as a benefit for those who are seeking information related to the topics covered on the Site.  In such cases, We would provide You with this information directly, rather than provide Your Personally Identifiable Information to the outside companies and professional associations. We may initiate the communication of any information or advertising for Our direct or indirect financial gain and it is done so without any compensation due to You or any other recipient of the information.
Affiliates Sites, Linked Sites, and Advertisements
We expect Our members, partners, advertisers, and Affiliates to respect Your Privacy and the privacy of Our other users. Be aware, however, that third parties (including, but not limited to, our partners, peers, advertisers, Affiliates, RideSharingDriver’s entities and personnel, other content providers, or other advertising services) (collectively referred to as “Promotional Partners”) whose websites may be accessible through the Site, may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices.
For example, during Your visit to the Site, or websites that the Site provides advertising services to, You may link to or view, certain content that is actually owned, created, hosted by a third party, or hosted or advertised by another service, or websites far removed from and unrelated to the Site. Also, through the Site, You may intentionally or unintentionally be introduced to, or be able to access, information, other websites, programs, products, services, features, contests or sweepstakes offered by other parties.  We are not responsible for the actions or policies of such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy policies of each of those third parties when providing information on any page operated by a third party.
While on the Site, our Promotional Partners or other third parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify some of Your preferences or retrieve information about You. For example, some Our advertising is served by third parties and may include cookies that enable the advertiser to determine whether You have seen a particular advertisement before. Other features available on the Site may offer services operated by third parties and may use cookies or other technology to gather information. RideSharingDriver does not control the use of this technology by third parties or the resulting information, and is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties.
You should also be aware that if You voluntarily disclose Personally Identifiable Information on message boards or in chat areas which may be accessible through the Site, that information can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of RideSharingDriver and this Policy.
