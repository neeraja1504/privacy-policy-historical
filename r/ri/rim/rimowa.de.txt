3.1 Overview
Depending on the services provided by our website and used by you, your choices and the configuration of your device (with respect in particular to cookies and other trackers), personal data concerning you (your "Data") collected and processed by RIMOWA mainly include: Your family name, first name, title, e-mail address, postal address and telephone number, your bank account details for the purposes of online sales, your billing and delivery address, information on the mode of payment, your past purchases, your preferences and interests, as well as your connection logs. For each activity using your Data, we will establish an appropriate lawful basis. Therefore, Data shall be collected either with your express consent, or where necessary to fulfil your orders (performance of a contract), for the pursuance of our legitimate interests when the processing is required for the management of our (the data controller's) daily business activities, or for compliance with our legal obligations. The lawful bases we rely upon for key activities in relation to this website are identified in sections 3.2 to 3.6 below.
Your Data shall be collected for the following purposes:
- to answer your questions sent via e-mail, contact forms and chats
- to enable you to create a "MyRIMOWA" personal space or guest account (customer account) and thereby purchase our products online;
- to manage any purchase orders that you may place online and their delivery as well as the applicable warranties;
- register your products online, to get access to additional services
- to provide you with a localised service – e.g. to find your nearest store or point of contact
- to ensure the security of your online transactions, to prevent fraud and payment defaults (see our Terms & Conditions for more details);
- to manage and optimise the customer relationship as described in further detail in sections 3.2 to 3.6 below;
- unless you object as indicated in the section below "Your rights" respectively in our Cookie Policy to better understand your preferences by analysing your behavior on our website and offer you products or services more in line with your interests;
- subject to your consent: to send you information about our offers, news and events (newsletters, invitations and other publications);
- to carry out statistical analysis regarding how this website is used (e.g. number of hits, duration of visits etc.) and of customer order behaviour. The Data that is indispensable for us to fulfil the purposes that are described above is marked with an asterisk on the various pages of the website. Should you not fill in these mandatory fields, we may not be able to process your requests and/or to provide you the requested products and services. Other Data is purely optional and allow us to know you better and to improve our communications and services accordingly. Further information on purposes and legal basis for specific processing scenarios can be found below.
3.2 Registration and customer account ("MyRIMOWA")
This website gives you the opportunity to register and create a customer account ("My-RIMOWA"). If you create a customer account, you will automatically be allocated a personal RIMOWA number ("MyRIMOWA ID") which is linked to the e-mail address you have provided. You can use your e-mail address for various RIMOWA processes and procedures (e.g. placing an online order). This is why you can also create a customer account independently of a specific online order. In order to create the customer account, we collect the data indicated in the corresponding registration form, in particular your title, first name and family name, postal address and e-mail address, as well as a password that you select yourself (“Master Data”). The mandatory fields in the registration form must have been completed in order to register and create a customer account. When we confirm your registration, we will allocate you a personal MyRIMOWA ID under which we will store your Master Data in our customer database. If you use your MyRIMOWA ID and your customer account for an online order or to use a further service, we will save the data collected in connection with the online order/use of the further service under your MyRIMOWA ID. We can process and use the data stored under your MyRIMOWA account to respond to enquiries about or requests for customer support, for example if you pose a question about registration, about your user account or other functions of your MyRIMOWA account to us, an affiliated company, a RIMOWA retailer or another customer support provider (customer support partner).
We may grant customer support partners limited access to the data stored on our customer database as regards your MyRIMOWA account for this purpose, in compliance with data protection regulations (and usually within the scope of a contract stipulating said services). When you pose a request to us or a customer support partner, the content of this request is stored under your MyRIMOWA account. This personal information is used solely for handling your enquiry.
The legal basis of any processing of your Master Data described in this section is performance of a contract.
We can also give you the opportunity, outside of this website, to register for further services using your MyRIMOWA ID and your login details for the customer account. In this case, your Master Data will also be used for the further service in question. We will provide you with separate information on the handling of your personal data in connection with the relevant further service.
3.3 Orders
You can place an online order on this website even without registering and creating a customer account ("Guest Order"). In this case, too, we need the data that is relevant to the order (in particular your first name and family name, billing and delivery address, information on the mode of payment and the corresponding payment details) and that you have to enter during the order process. The mandatory fields in the registration form must have been completed in order to place a Guest Order. We save the information that is collected and arises in connection with a Guest Order in our order data-base in order to process the online order and then to fulfil statutory retention obligations.
If you place an order (on this website, by phone or in a store) using your MyRIMOWA ID and your customer account, we will save the information that is collected and arises in connection with the order under your MyRIMOWA ID in our customer database; this is also done in order to manage any purchase orders and their delivery as well as the applicable warranties. The legal basis of any processing of your personal data described in this section is performance of a contract and compliance with legal obligations (for example, our obligations under consumer protection law).
3.4 Functions on this Website
On this website, we can offer you further optional functions for which personal data or other information has to be collected, e.g. if you participate in a survey on this website or send us questions or feedback. We will only collect, process and use such data and information to the extent that is required for the function in question (e.g. to answer your question or process your feedback). Some of this processing is necessary for taking steps at your request to enter into a contract with you. Additional processing is necessary for the purpose of the legitimate interests pursued by RIMOWA: We have a legitimate interest in improving our services as well as our website itself and in carrying out, inter alia, surveys in this regard. Such legitimate interest of RIMOWA is appropriately balanced with the interests of the users within the limitations abovementioned.
3.5 Direct Marketing without your consent
In certain cases, sending you direct advertising without your explicit consent is permissible by law. This may, for example, relate to the use of an e-mail address that we have received in connection with the sale of goods or services. In the latter case, we will draw your attention to this possibility and to your right to object when we collect the e-mail address. In all cases, you have an absolute right to prevent (i.e., opt-out of) direct marketing at any time.
The processing of your personal data described in this section is necessary for the purpose of the legitimate interests pursued by RIMOWA.

Pages with DoubleClick ads include ad tags that instruct browsers to request ad content from our servers. When the server delivers the ad content, it also sends a cookie. But a page doesn’t have to show DoubleClick ads for this to happen; it just needs to include DoubleClick ad tags, which might load a click tracker or impression pixel instead. The Floodlight Tag will only be collecting pseudonymous data in order to track the success of certain RIMOWA campaigns. It is not going to create a personal profile for you.
