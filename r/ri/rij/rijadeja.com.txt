Third-Party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites:
The Website may be linked to internet websites operated by other companies. Some of these websites may be co-branded with our name or logo, even though they are not operated or maintained by us. R.I.Jadeja.com may also permit other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the Website.

If R.I.Jadeja.com learns that personally-identifiable information of persons less than 13-years-of-age has been collected on the Website without parental consent, then R.I.Jadeja.com will take the appropriate steps to delete this information. If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under the age of 13 has a registered account with the Website, then you may alert R.I.Jadeja.com at info@rijadeja.com and request that R.I.Jadeja.com delete that child’s personal information from its systems.
