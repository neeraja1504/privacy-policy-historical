Privacy Policy | Reader's Digest Asia
TO SERVE YOU BETTER…
PRIVACY POLICY OF READER'S DIGEST ASIA PTE. LTD. Our contact information is: The Privacy Office, Reader's Digest, P.O. Box 600, Singapore Post Centre, Singapore 914020. You can also fax to 67491312, or email to friends@rdasia.com.sg
Collection of information
Reader's Digest keeps/maintains a record of your custom with the Company, your contact details, your prize draw history and other information which you have provided to us.
We maintain your record so that:
we can provide you with timely customer service;
we can send you renewal subscription offers, new book and product offers, discounts and other benefit opportunities
we can send you other prize draw opportunities, and
we can service you the products which you have ordered.
Without this record, Reader's Digest would not be able to do any of this and, as such, the information you provide is required.
In addition, Reader's Digest occasionally, through proper contractual arrangements, will rent or acquire information from reliable third party companies regarding Singapore consumers (who have so consented). The only purpose for these occasional rental activities is to afford Reader's Digest the opportunity to send these consumers promotional offers and prize draw opportunities.
Furthermore, Reader's Digest will occasionally, through proper contractual agreements, disclose the contact details of certain of its customer base, of those who have so consented in advance, to reliable third party companies. The sole purpose of these disclosures is to allow these third party companies to send or make you consumer, financial and insurance offers that we believe may be of interest to our customers.

Cookies are not used to record any personal information such as your name, address or email address.
Security
When you begin to place credit card details on the RD Online Store or RD microsites, a secure system software called "Secure Sockets Layer" (SSL) encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us.
Third party links
On occasion we include links to third parties on this website. Where we provide a link it does not mean that we endorse or approve that site’s policy towards visitor privacy. You should review their privacy policy before sending them any personal data.
