To do this we access publicly available personal data relating to the potential supporter including reviewing their known associations, criminal convictions and offences. If you would like further information on the Gift Policy and due diligence process please contact the Development & Alumni Relations team via the contact details below.
On occasion, someone you know – for example friends, family or a business associate – may give us your name and contact details as someone who is likely to be interested in the work of the RCA.

How do we keep your personal information safe?
The RCA does not sell personal data to any third parties.
Any data we gather is kept strictly confidential and we ensure that there are appropriate technical controls in place to protect your personal details:
data is stored on a secure drive and in a password-protected CRM database that only designated members of RCA staff have access to
our online forms are always encrypted and our network is protected and routinely monitored
we undertake regular reviews of who has access to information that we hold, to ensure that your information is only accessible by appropriately trained staff, volunteers and contractors.
We will only share your personal data with external organisations if we are required to do so by law. If we share data with a third party, we ensure that appropriate data sharing agreements are in place before doing so and that partners have a legal responsibility to only use the information for the purposes for which we supply it. Examples of where we may do this include:
mailing houses which send out alumni magazines on behalf of the RCA
specialist third-party agencies who screen alumni names and addresses against data bureau to keep our mailing lists up-to-date
consultants and third-party agencies that advise us on individual's’ capacity to donate or potential interest in the RCA, for example through wealth screening.
If you have joined a specific alumni club, such as the AlumniRCA East Coast Club, then we may share limited data with the organisers of that group, so they can manage events. The organisers sign an agreement to handle your data securely and only for this agreed purpose. We do not give out your data to organisers of groups that you have not opted into, but we may contact you on their behalf.
We are happy to help you to get in contact with individual alumni, but will not release their personal contact details without permission and therefore will normally send a message to them on your behalf.
How long do we hold your data?
We will retain your data indefinitely in support of your lifelong relationship with the RCA, or until you request us to do otherwise.
Where you exercise your right to deletion of data, we will retain a core set of personal data (name, education details (if related to the RCA), unique identification number and date of birth) to ensure we do not contact you inadvertently in future. We may also need to retain some financial records about you for statutory purposes (e.g. Gift Aid, anti-fraud and accounting matters).
