United States Border Services (Customs and Homeland Security) requires that all items shipping from Canada to the United States that are valued greater than $2,000.00 USD must show the TAX ID or Social Security Number for the Importer of Record. This is mandatory and must be on the Commercial Invoice and the Worldwide Services Waybill.
In addition to supplying your TAX ID or SSN, United States Border Services may require form 5106 to be filled out prior to your shipment being cleared through customs. We can not complete this form on your behalf due to the confidential nature of its contents. United States Border Services will contact you directly for this information. Here is a link to the 5106 form you may be required to provide.
When shipping to US businesses, the business TAX ID is required, and when shipping to individuals, the SSN is required.
