Privacy Policy - Legal - RRPproxy The Metaregistry
The protection of your personal data is very important to us. Our processing of personal data is therefore designed to be fully compliant with applicable data protection laws and regulations.
With this policy we intend to clarify and inform you – our customer – about which personal data we process, the purposes of said processing, how this processing is performed, who has access to your personal data, for how long we process this data and how you can exercise your rights with regard to our data processing.
For the personal data required by us for the performance of the agreed service, "Controller" within the meaning of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) and other data protection laws and regulations is:
Key-Systems GmbH
Im Oberen Werk 1
66386 St. Ingbert
Germany
Phone: +49-68949396850
Email: info (at) key-systems (dot) net
The data protection officer of Key-Systems can be contacted at datenschutz (at) key-systems (dot) net.
For all other processing of data where we do not control the processing, particularly for domain registration services, the controller is the registry operator of the relevant TLD as well as – for all registrations in generic top level domains – ICANN is joint controller with the registry operator.
What personal data do we process about you?
Personal data is any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. We process data that you provide voluntarily to us, data that we collect in an automated fashion when you visit our premises, events or websites and data processed when you access and/or use our products and services.
We may process the following personal data about our customers as inventory data: your name, your email address, your phone number and (if applicable) fax number, your job title, your full personal address, the organization you work for (if applicable to the transaction), your gender, your language preference, the IP addresses you use to connect to our systems, your account name, the services you order, your financial data including bank account or credit card information, your login details.
We may also request additional personal data if required for the specific service you requested.
Our processing of third party data
By transmitting personal data of third parties (e.g. when you order a service for someone else using their personal information or when using their personal information as additional contacts) you are responsible about informing affected parties about the terms of our privacy policy and for obtaining the necessary consent of those parties for your use and our processing of their data. You will particularly inform them about any processing and transfers of their data to other parties as described in this policy.
Purposes for processing
The data you transmit to us upon requesting a service (or for correction, renewal or updates of service requests) is required to establish a contractual relationship between you and us, for purposes required for our provision of requested services as well as auxiliary services to you, for proper and secure management of your customer account, to prevent abusive use of our services, to enable us to provide information on expiration and required renewals of services and to allow us to comply with applicable legal obligations. The legal basis for such processing is Art. 6 I b) GDPR.
Personal data may be transmitted to service providers acting as data controllers that are involved in our provision of services to you (such as registry operators, certification authorities, ICANN) in furtherance of the purposes of these data controllers for collecting and processing personal data based on their legitimate interests in accordance with Art 6 I f) GDPR. Legitimate interests pursued by data controllers regarding your data transmitted to them by us include the establishing of a contractual relationship between you and the provider, the mitigation and/or prevention of abuse and/or fraud, the verification of compliance with applicable eligibility requirements and/or acceptable use policies for services provided by them, the central management of a service register, assurance of data accuracy and the provision of continuity of service in case of our business failure.
Transmission of your personal data may also, in some cases, be required by data controllers to comply with applicable legal obligations in accordance with Art. 6 I c) GDPR. Please review the applicable registry policies for direct references to such legal obligations.
Your domain name registration data may also be processed and transmitted in the context of a data escrow program in order to safeguard domain registrations in case the registrar and/or registry operator ceases its activity of registering and managing domain names.
We may also transfer your personal data to third parties to safeguard legitimate interests of such third parties in accordance with Art 6 I f), except where such interests are overridden by your fundamental rights and freedoms.
We may also transmit your personal data to service providers and/or publish your data based on your explicit, informed and freely given consent, if applicable, for example if you explicitly request the publication of your data in a registration database despite our ability to redact or hide such data. This consent may be withdrawn at any time.
How do we process personal data?
We process personal information in full compliance with the technical, organizational and legal requirements of the GDPR in our data center(s) in Germany. We publish data you provide to us for web-hosting purposes in one of our shared hosting locations in Germany or on the Isle of Man, or – at your request – in the USA. We apply data minimization principles where possible and we continuously update our security measures to help protect your personal data and other information against unauthorized access, loss, destruction or alteration. Access to your data is possible only through an encrypted connection. Third parties do not have access to your data unless we provide such access in accordance with the terms below.

If applicable, your personal data may be provided to operators of registration database (formerly whois) services and the users of such services if required and such provision and use is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, as permitted under under Art. 6 I f) of the GDPR.
