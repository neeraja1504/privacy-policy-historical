How We Protect Your Personal Information
The security of your personal information is important to us. We use reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect the personal information we collect. DFIN uses reasonable measures to safeguard personally identifiable information from loss, theft, misuse, alteration and unauthorized access or destruction.

Enforcing policies and procedures for our employees in their handling of personal data; and
Using technologies designed to safeguard data during its transmission, such as SSL encryption for the data you provide on some parts of our site and using appropriate security to safeguard the data that we have received.

There is, however, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage that can be 100% secure. Therefore, DFIN cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.

You are responsible for protecting your username and password from third party access, and for selecting passwords that are secure.
How We Monitor and Enforce
DFIN regularly reviews our compliance with our Privacy Notice. We also adhere to several self-regulatory frameworks in addition to complying with applicable laws. If we receive formal written complaints, we will follow up with the person making the complaint. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities to resolve any complaints that cannot be resolved directly.
