THE ROALD DAHL MUSEUM AND STORY CENTRE – RECRUITMENT PRIVACY NOTICE
The kind of information about you that we collect store and use
As someone who is applying to work with THE ROALD DAHL MUSEUM AND STORY CENTRE , we do need to collect and use information about you as an individual. We may typically collect, store and use the following types of personal information about our job candidates:
The information you provide on our THE ROALD DAHL MUSEUM AND STORY CENTRE  application form: name, title, addresses, telephone numbers and personal email addresses, qualifications and educational establishments attended, your employment history
Any additional information you provide in a CV and covering letter
Any information (opinion) we collect through the interview process
Any information (opinion) we collect following interviews, from taking up references.
If you are offered the job, we may collect, store and use sensitive personal information about you during the later stages of a recruitment process, including information about your health (including health and sickness records), in order to be certain that we can accommodate any specific needs you may have. ** **
How is your personal information collected?
We collect personal information about job candidates through the application and recruitment process, either directly from you as a candidate, or sometimes from an employment agency.
We may sometimes collect additional information from third parties including former employers e.g. as referees. This will usually only be the case for candidates on the verge of being offered a job, subject to references.
How we will use information about you
We will only use your personal information in a lawful way. The lawful basis for using personal information about job candidates is that it is in our legitimate interests to:
Assess your suitability for a role
Keep you informed about the recruitment process
Keep records about our recruitment process to support the consistency and quality of our own procedures
If we collect, store and use more sensitive personal information we need to have an even stronger basis for doing so. Typically, this would require at least one of the following to be in place first:
Your explicit written consent
A situation where we need to carry out our legal obligations or exercise rights in connection with employment
A situation where it is needed in the public interest, such as for equal opportunities monitoring
Where you have already made the information public
We do not use automated data processing in relation to job candidates ** **
Sharing personal data
As part of our security measures, access to personal information held by the Museum will be limited to those members of Museum staff or volunteers who have a direct role in using the data.
We will only share the personal data we hold about you with third parties such as a recruitment agency, if that is how we received your application. We will only share the personal data we hold about you with third parties when there is a lawful reason to do so, it is in line with the specified purposes for that data, and the third party has appropriate security measures in place.
Storing personal data
Your personal data will only be kept for six months after we have told you whether you have been appointed to the job.
We keep your personal information for that period so that we can show, in the event of a legal claim, that we have not discriminated against candidates and that we have conducted the recruitment exercise in a fair and transparent way. After this period, we will securely destroy your personal information in accordance with our Data Management and Retention Schedule.
Your rights in relation to your personal information
By law you have certain rights in relation to your own personal information:
The right to be informed about whether and how we may be processing your personal data
The right of access to your own personal data
The right to rectification if the information we have is inaccurate
The right to erasure if there is no longer a lawful reason for us to retain the data e.g. if consent was the lawful reason, and consent is withdrawn. This is also known as ‘the right to be forgotten’
The right to restrict processing e.g. if the accuracy of your data is being challenged, you can request your data is not processed until that situation is resolved
The right to data portability, when data has been provided in an easily transferable machine-readable format
The right to object to the processing of your personal data at all, especially in relation to direct marketing
Rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling.
