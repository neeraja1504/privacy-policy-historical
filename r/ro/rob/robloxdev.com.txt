Roblox Privacy and Cookie Policy – Roblox Support
About Roblox and this Privacy Policy
Roblox is an imagination platform, where users are encouraged to design, create, and interact with whatever they can imagine. As a user of the Roblox platform, you and your friends can collaborate on building or just gather and explore other users’ creations. Your privacy is important to us; this is why we created this Privacy Policy so that you are aware of what information is collected, how we use it, and who we share it with.
This Privacy Policy covers our websites on the roblox.com domain, our Roblox mobile, virtual reality (“VR”) and Xbox apps, the Roblox Player, the Roblox Studio, and our other websites, products, software, applications, content, data feeds and other services (“ Service ”) on which an authorized link to this Privacy Policy is posted. This Policy covers our practices regarding Roblox users of all ages, including a unique set of practices for those under the age of 13 (“ children ” or “ child ”). The Service is operated by or on behalf of Roblox Corporation.
If you are an EEA resident, this whole Policy applies to you. However, EEA residents should see Section 15 below, which will inform you in detail about the personal information we process, how we process it, for which purposes we process it, with whom we share it, on what legal basis we process and transfer your personal information and which rights you have regarding the processing of your personal information.
Roblox is also committed to protecting the privacy of our users, including children. Please see the “Children’s Privacy and Parental Controls” section below for more information about your rights as a parent or legal guardian of our children users and the measures we take to afford children users with additional protections and comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“ COPPA ”). To learn more about COPPA, you may consult this simple one-page informational guide from the kidSAFE Seal Program – www.kidsafeseal.com/knowaboutcoppa.html.

Information Collected on our Corporate Websites
Please note that our Corporate Websites (which may include corp.roblox.com, blog.roblox.com, and their subdomains) are general audience websites. On these sites, we may provide information regarding the corporate side of Roblox, press information, career information, and other general audience information. We may also ask for your name, email address, employment details if you send us a CV, resume or other details of your employment history in connection with an advertised job vacancy or a general inquiry regarding employment opportunities with us and other information so that we can provide corporate-related information to you or respond to your job application. No game play happens on the Corporate Websites. As such, the parts of this Privacy Policy that discuss game play or discuss children are not applicable to the Corporate Websites.
How Roblox Works
Roblox works like this:
* A user creates a username and a virtual character that is his or her identity in the Roblox world.
* Registered users interact with other users through in-game or website chat, personal messaging (within the Roblox environment), user forums, groups, and other similar features, with available privacy settings designed to allow users to restrict or disable communications with other users.
* Each user is given one or more pieces of virtual real estate on which they can build houses, cars, machines, roller coasters, or anything else you can imagine with building blocks and code; these places are called “games.”
* Users search for, find, and play games made by other users; they play these games with other users from around the world, and are identified only by their username.
* The Roblox world includes a virtual currency known as Robux; users can earn or purchase Robux in a variety of ways, and use them to buy or sell items for their characters, for in-game items, and other uses.
* Users who earn a large amount of Robux virtual currency are allowed to sell that currency back to Roblox subject to certain participation requirements. See our [DevEx Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/hc/en-us/articles/115005718246) for more information.
* Users can purchase premium services, including monthly or yearly subscriptions.
* For more information on how our service works, please see our [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/hc/en-us/articles/115004647846).
Information You Provide when Setting Up an Account on Roblox
Registered users
All users must create a Roblox Account to play our games. To create a Roblox account, we will ask you to create a unique username and password (so you can log in to your account), and to provide other demographic information such as your age or date of birth, gender, country or language preference (so we can customize your experience on Roblox).
Users are encouraged not to create a username that reflects their own name or other personal information. Users should also not pick a password that is easy to guess, and should not share their password.
Usernames are used for participating in Service features, and we do not use them to identify individual users outside of their activities on our Service. Usernames are shared with the parties listed in Section 7 below.
Users may be asked to provide or may choose to add an email address to their account for added verification and/or to enable certain features. The primary purpose for this email address is to provide account security, as this is the only way for Roblox to check the authenticity of an account owner. In this circumstance, children are asked to provide a parent email address. Users may change the email address associated with their account at any time; however, a notification will be sent to the previously provided email address upon making that change.
Additional Personal Information You Provide When Using Roblox Features
In addition to account setup on Roblox, we may collect and process personal information from you directly if you use the following features and activities (as applicable):
* _When you make purchases on the Service_. Users can purchase virtual currency or premium subscriptions, for example, in the form of Robux, Premium memberships, etc., and may use a variety of payment methods. When making purchases, users or their parents may be required to enter billing information, including name, billing address, credit card or other payment information, and billing email. Your billing information, transaction details, and purchase history may also be retained and used by our payment processors to resolve subsequent billing disputes and inquiries.
* _When you post, share, or otherwise transmit comments or messages on Roblox via community features, such as public chat or private chat, forums, group walls, personal posts, etc_. We may collect these comments and messages, and they may be monitored, filtered and moderated for purposes such as removal of profanity, personal information, and other inappropriate conversations. We may use pre-filtered chat, comments and messages (of EEA and US users other than children) for purposes such as training and improving our filter technology, except that we will not engage in these activities with private chat, comments, and messages of EEA users.
* _When you participate in our Roblox Developer Exchange Program_. We require you to provide us with an IRS W-9 form (for U.S. taxpayers) or W-8 form (for non-U.S. taxpayers).
* _When you agree to use our “Find Friends” feature_. We may ask your permission to access and collect personal information about your contacts in your address book on your mobile phone, either at the time you register for our Service or otherwise. We do so to help you connect with your friends on our Service. As part of our “Find Friends” feature, we will automatically access and collect information in your address book from time to time in order to sync your contacts. On mobile, we also offer a “Nearby Friends” feature that allows you to connect with other Roblox players near you; we require microphone access to use this feature, but do not store any of recordings generated by this feature. However, as detailed below, our “Find Friends” feature may not be available in certain locations.
* _When you provide us with your phone number_. If you choose to provide a phone number during registration, you may receive a verification SMS after sign-up to confirm your ownership of the number, which will allow you to log in via mobile. Your phone number may also be used to recover a lost or forgotten password. Additionally, with your consent, we may use your phone number and access your contact list to find other friends using Roblox. If you do not want us to use your phone number to find your friends on Roblox, please do not activate this feature. Please note that our “Find Friends” feature may not be available in certain locations. In particular, we take steps to not provide the feature to users we have classified as residents of the European Economic Area and to not collect the phone numbers of children.
* _When you use our games on a VR platform_. If you play our games on a VR platform, we will collect your physical movement information in order to replicate your movement in the game. This information is only used to provide the Service and is not stored.
* _When you contact or send communications to us_. For example, when you contact customer support, report a problem, or submit questions, concerns, or comments regarding our Service or its content, we may collect contact information such as your email address and other important information about your inquiry or concern. This information is used to respond to your communications, fulfill your requests, or provide other customer support.
* _When you use or interact with third-party plug-ins that may be available on the Service for users other than children_. This includes third-party social media widgets, share buttons, and/or login mechanisms. These features may include social plugins from Google, Facebook, Twitter or other platforms, and may be subject to the privacy policies of these other companies as posted on their respective websites. When you use these features, certain information from your social media accounts may be accessed by or shared with Roblox, and likewise, certain information about your use of Roblox may be posted to your profile on those platforms.
* _When you participate in contests, competitions, sweepstakes, giveaways, prize draws or other promotions that we may run or sponsor on our Service_. These promotions may involve the collection and use of certain contact information (such as your name, email address, and/or phone number) for prize fulfillment purposes, as well as other information or content needed for the specific promotion. In some jurisdictions, we are required to publicly share information of winners.
* _When you respond to or participate in voluntary research or demographic surveys or studies_. These surveys may collect information about your likes and dislikes, game play interests and habits, general hobbies and interests, and other lifestyle information or preferences. These surveys may ask for personal information.
* _When you request or agree to location-based services from Roblox, which may be available to our users other than children_. With your consent, we may collect or track real-time or precise geolocation information to provide services such as tagging, check-in and content delivery, or geo-based advertising, or other services that are dependent on knowing where you are. This information may be collected in combination with an identifier associated with your device to enable us to recognize your mobile browser or device when you return to the Service. You can always stop the collection of location information by updating your device settings, stopping to use the Service, or uninstalling our mobile applications.
* _When you subscribe to other features or activities_. We may offer other features or activities on our Services from time to time, and you may be able to submit or upload personal information in connection with such features. The data being collected for such features and their intended uses will be evident at the time of data collection.
* _When you browse, navigate, or otherwise interact with the Service_. We collect information from your device when you visit our websites, as outlined in the “Cookies and Similar Technologies” section below.
You are under no obligation to provide personal information to Roblox when requested. However, if you choose to withhold any requested information, we may not be able to provide you with certain services and features.
In addition to the specific uses above, any information that you provide or that we collect on the Service may be generally used for the following purposes:
* To operate, maintain, and improve the Service;
* To give you access to the Service and related features, or restrict your access;
* To personalize the Service or content on the Service, as well as make it more user-friendly;
* To allow you to manage your Roblox account or account information, update your account settings, and (where applicable) make purchases or subscribe to services;
* To communicate with you about the Service (product changes, feature updates, etc.);
* To provide technical support or customer service;
* To deliver advertising for our Services that may be relevant to your interests;
* To detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent or illegal activity, and prosecute those responsible for that activity;
* To research technological development and demonstration;
* To identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality;
* To audit interactions, transactions, and other compliance activities; and
* To protect the integrity, safety, or security of the Service or our users, comply with legal obligations, or enforce compliance with our Terms of Service, or other restrictions placed on your use of the Service.
Cookies and Similar Technologies
Like most websites, we use cookies and other standard Internet technologies to help us improve our Service.
Cookies
A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit the site. It enables the website to remember your actions and preferences (such as login, language, font size and other display preferences) over a period of time, for example so you don’t have to re-enter them whenever you come back to the website or browse from one page to another.
A cookie can be classified by its lifespan and the domain to which it belongs. By lifespan, a cookie is either a:
* Session cookie which is erased when the user closes the browser; or
* Persistent cookie which remains on the user’s computer/device for a pre-defined period of time.
As for the domain to which it belongs, there are either:
* First-party cookies which are set by the web server of the visited page and share the same domain (in this case roblox.com domain); or
* Third-party cookies stored by a different domain to the visited page’s domain. This can happen when the webpage references a file, such as JavaScript, located outside its domain
Pixel Tags/Web Beacons
A pixel tag (also known as a web beacon) is a piece of code embedded in the Services that collects information about visitors’ engagement on that web page. The use of a pixel allows us to record, for example, that a visitor has visited a particular web page or clicked on a particular advertisement.
How we use cookies
When you visit or access the Service, we may – by means of cookies, beacons, tags, scripts, and/or other similar technologies – automatically collect technical information about the devices and software you use to access the Service, such as the type of Internet browser or mobile device you use, the website or source that linked or referred you to the Service, your IP address or device ID (or other persistent identifier that uniquely identifies your computer or mobile device on the Internet), the operating system of your computer or mobile device, and other similar technical information. These same technologies (or a combination of them) may also be used to help us:
* Capture and store users’ preferences, account settings, and certain login information (for convenience, user verification, and account security);
* Compile statistics and analytics about your use of and interaction with the Service, including details about how and where our Service is downloaded from or accessed, how often a user visits or uses the Service, the date and time of user visits to, and actions on, the Service, which areas of the Service are visited and for how long, information regarding in-game activities, and other similar traffic, usage, and trend data;
* Mobile analytic tools to allow us to better understand the functionality of our mobile software on your device and gain insights about how mobile software is used;
* Gather important functionality, testing, and performance data about our Service, including performance data related to our mobile application, the Roblox Player, and Roblox Studio, such as networking activity, CPU load, and resource usage, among other relevant data;
* Moderate user behavior on the Service, such as protecting against payment fraud and other inappropriate activities;
* Gather demographic information about our user base; and;
* Perform other similar functions
We will not use cookies or similar technologies other than for the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy.
Third party advertising and ad networks
Roblox partners with third-party advertisers, ad server companies, and ad networks (“third-party advertising companies”) to promote our Service. If you respond to one of our advertisements and visit or register to use our Service, we or our service providers may provide these third-party advertising companies with identifiers from your device or computer, such as an IP address or device ID, to help us analyze our user acquisition efforts.
For our users that are children, Roblox partners with third-party advertising companies to serve contextual advertising, cap the frequency of advertising, and related uses permitted by COPPA. Roblox does not show behaviorally-targeted or retargeted ads to children or track such users for targeted advertising purposes.
NOTE: In order to disable advertising-related tracking at your request, companies may need to set an opt-out cookie on your browser. Sometimes a browser’s configuration may prevent companies from setting such cookies, for example, if your browser is set to block all third-party cookies by default. Therefore, you may need to change your browser settings to accept cookies, in order to fully disable advertising-related tracking.
Your choices
Most web and mobile device browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can change your browser to prevent that or to notify you each time a cookie is set.
Some browser manufacturers provide comprehensive help relating to cookie management in their products. Please see below for more information:

Information Sharing
Please note that Roblox has not and does not sell personal information about you to third-party companies for their independent purposes. Roblox may disclose your information for a business purpose as set forth below.
Agents and contractors
Roblox may share users’ information, including personal information including but not limited to billing information or usernames, with our third-party agents, contractors, or service providers who are hired to perform services on Roblox’s behalf. These providers may operate or support certain functions of the Service. Below is an illustrative list of functions for which we may use third-party service providers, and the names of the providers we may use to perform these functions:
* Analytics services (e.g., Google LLC, comScore, Flurry Analytics);
* User Acquisition services (e.g., AppsFlyer);;
* Community filtering and moderation services (e.g., CommunitySift);
* Customer support services (e.g., Zendesk);
* Surveys and promotions (e.g., Reach3);
* Billing services and payment gateway providers (e.g., Kount, Worldpay, PayPal, Incomm, Blackhawk, Google, Apple, Amazon, Windows Store, Xbox, Xsolla); and
* Hosting and content delivery network services (e.g., AWS, Equinix, CenturyLink).
These agents and contractors are only allowed to use the personal information shared with them for the specific tasks they’ve been hired to do and consistent with this Privacy Policy, and for no other purposes, and they are not permitted to sell the personal information shared with them. Roblox takes steps to ensure that all service providers with access to personal information are capable of protecting the information we share with them.
Public forums and community areas
We offer users the ability to use forums and similar means of public discussion. If you use any messaging, posting, or chat functions on Roblox, you should be aware that any personal information submitted there will be available to anyone who has access to that content, including other users, and can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for how other individuals use the information posted in this manner.
Developers
The developers of the games you access will be provided your username and the country you are based in. The information shall enable the developers to determine their player base, so they can adjust their games to the legal requirements of the respective country. We offer developers a tool which allows them to review the country of origin of players who play their games. For this purpose, we will determine the user’s country of access to the Roblox website based on the IP address. We will not share your IP address with the developers.
Legal disclosures
We may disclose personal information about you as required or permitted by law and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Service. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we also may disclose personal information about you in response to a request from law enforcement agencies, regulators, or other public agencies (including schools or children services), or if we believe in good faith that such disclosure may prevent a crime, facilitate an investigation related to public safety or protect the safety of a child using our Service, protect the security or integrity of our Service, or enable us to take precautions against liability or to protect our rights.
Business transfers
Information about our users, including personal information, may be disclosed and otherwise transferred to an acquirer, successor, or assignee as part of any merger, acquisition, sale of assets, or similar transaction, or in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which information is transferred to one or more third parties as one of our business assets. Where required by applicable law, we will inform you of such disclosure and obtain your consent.
De-identified information
We share aggregated, automatically-collected, or otherwise de-identified personal information with third parties for various purposes, including (i) compliance with reporting obligations; (ii) for business or marketing purposes; (iii) to assist us and other parties in understanding our users' interests, habits and usage patterns for certain programs, content, services, advertisements, promotions and/or functionality available through the Services.
Security and Data Retention
Security
The security of your personal information is important to us. We have security measures in place to attempt to protect the personal or other sensitive information submitted to us against the loss, misuse and alteration of personal information under our control. While we cannot ensure or guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration of information will never occur, we use reasonable efforts to prevent it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, and we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you provide to us. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we do not accept liability for unintentional disclosure.
When using the Services or providing personal information to us, we may communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of the Services. If we learn of an incident that may qualify as a breach under applicable law, we may attempt to notify you electronically by posting a notice on the Services, by mail or by sending an e-mail to you.
Retention
Roblox may retain users’ account data internally for the following purposes:
* Billing information and transaction histories are retained to resolve subsequent billing disputes and inquiries;
* Publicly shared content and game items are retained for use by the community (e.g., a user-created virtual shirt sold to another user is kept in the system because the recipient now “owns” a copy of that item);
* User account history is retained to support subsequent customer service inquiries and to provide, improve and develop the Services;
* To promote safety and security on and for the Services; and
* To resolve disputes, establish legal defenses, conduct audits, pursue legitimate business purposes, enforce our agreements, and comply with our legal obligations.
We may retain your information for as long as is necessary and relevant to your use of the Service and our operations, which may include retaining your information beyond the end of your use of the Service.
External links
Our Service may, from time to time, contain links to external sites or applications. We are not responsible for the privacy policies or the content of such sites or applications. To make clear when you are linking to a third-party site or application, we may display a warning message informing you when you are leaving our Service.
Children’s Privacy and Parental Controls
We recognize that children deserve added protections with regard to their personal information and privacy online. For this reason, when children register for the Service, their account is automatically set to "Privacy Mode." This means that children users will not have access to certain features, such as social media plug-ins, some forms of third-party advertising, and certain types of notification alerts.
When a child creates an account on Roblox, we may collect a username, password, birthdate, and parent’s email address. This information is used to give the child access to the Service (with certain default settings) and, if a parent’s email is provided, to communicate with the parent about the child’s account. For example, we may use the parent’s email to send an email notification about the child’s account creation and an invitation for the parent to review, update settings, and approve of their child’s account. We may use the birthdate the child provides when signing up for the Service to determine which features on Roblox the child should have access to, and to determine when the child will be given broader access to features on our Service. In general, we will not use or share account information (including personal information) from your child’s account without, except for the permissible purposes stated in this Privacy Policy, and if required by law.
To make any requests for changes to your child’s account or requests for the removal of personal information collected about you or your child from our Service (as applicable), or to request that we stop the further collection or use of your or your child’s personal information in connection with the Service (as applicable), please complete the Customer Support Form at https://www.roblox.com/support.
We offer all accounts, including children’s accounts, the ability to modify chat/communication settings (for example, limiting interaction to just friends or no one), as well as a special “Restricted Account Mode” which turns off all forms of chat and public commenting and which allows the user to access only a selection of filtered games on Roblox. We recommend that parents familiarize themselves with all of the safety features and parental controls available in the Settings area of the Service (a description of which can be found here) and to accompany their children when they are playing online.
We proactively filter all public and comment areas of the Service (such as chat, forums, group walls, personal posts, etc.) to remove references to addresses, emails, phone numbers, or other personal information regardless of security and privacy settings. All text is also filtered for profanity, phishing, and adult or suggestive content. Our system uses a combination of human and automated processes. However, like all filtering technology, our systems are not 100% effective.
If you are a child, it is a good idea to talk to and ask your parent(s) or guardian(s) for permission before using or playing on the Service. If you do not get such permission, you should not use our Service.
Parents should contact Roblox immediately if they have any concerns regarding the Service, wish to review information collected from your child, or have that information modified or deleted. Please see the Contact Information section below for further details. If we become aware that a child has provided us with Personal Data, we will delete any Personal Data we have collected, unless we have a legal obligation to keep it, and terminate the child’s account and/or revert them to the underage experience, as applicable.
Accessing and Updating Your Personal Information
If personal information about you changes, or if you no longer desire to use our Service, you may correct, update, amend, or deactivate your account under your account settings or by contacting Roblox using the personal information set out above in Sec. 1. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe. For children under the age of 13, please see the “Children’s Privacy and Parental Controls” section above. See Sections 14 and 15 for additional rights available to California and European Economic Area residents.
Storage and International Transfer of Your Personal Information
Roblox is based in the U.S. Your personal information which we collect are sent to and stored on secure servers located in the United States of America. Such storage is necessary in order to process the information.
Roblox operates globally and we may transfer the personal data that we collect from you to our other offices and/or to the third parties mentioned in the circumstances described above (see “Information Sharing”), which may be situated outside of your country or regional area, and may be processed by staff operating outside your country or regional area. In particular, information provided to us or collected by us likely will be transferred to and processed in the United States by us or our agents and contractors. The data protection laws of the United States or other countries may not be as comprehensive or equivalent to those in your country of residence. Wherever we transfer your personal information, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected.

Personal data of children
Please note that when users under the age of 13 register for the Service, their account is automatically set to “Privacy Mode.” This means that these users will not have access to certain features, such as social media plug-ins, some forms of third party advertising, and certain types of notification alerts.
When a child creates an account on Roblox, we may process a username, password, birthdate and parent email address. We process this information to give the user access to the Service and to communicate with the parent about the minor’s account (if a parent email was provided). For example, we may use the parent’s email to send an email notification about the child’s account creation and an invitation for the parent to review, update settings, and approve of their child's account. We may use the birthdate the child provides when signing up for the Service to determine which features on Roblox the child should have access to and to determine when the child will turn 13 years old and can be given broader access to features on our Service. This processing activity is based on Article 6 sec. 1 sent. 1 lit. b GDPR (“performance of a contract”). In general, we will not use or share account information (including personal information) from a minor’s account except for the permissible purposes stated in this Privacy Policy, and, if required by law, only with the prior verifiable consent of a parent or legal guardian (Article 6 sec. 1 sent. 1 lit. a and Article 8 sec. 1 GDPR).
