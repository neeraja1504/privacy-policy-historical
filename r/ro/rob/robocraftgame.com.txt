When you play any of the games and/or services offered by Freejam, or use any of the communication features on the Websites and in the Game, your IP address (the Internet protocol address from which you access any of the above) may be stored in our records. When any Game is updated or “patched”, our patch routine may check your computer to see that you have the most recent version of the game-specific files; when you communicate on the Website, within the Game or any other communication feature on the Website or within the Game (e.g. live chat, instant message services and the like), ever “privately” to another person, you do so with the understanding that those communications go through our servers, can be monitored by us, you have no expectation of privacy in any of those communications and, accordingly, you expressly consent to monitoring of communications that you send and receive.
We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Policy. All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Freejam uses industry-standard technology, such as firewalls, in an effort to protect the confidentiality of your personal information. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our Website of the Game, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access.
Generally, the information that you disclose on our website is collected by Freejam or by third parties such as co-sponsors or vendors for the promotion. Freejam’s use of any such information will be governed by this Policy. The names of third parties such as co-sponsors (other than vendors hired by Freejam to conduct, administer, and execute a promotion on behalf of Freejam) will be disclosed to you when you are asked to sign up for the promotion.
We generally do not sell or trade any personal information about our customers, prospects, or visitors to any third parties. We may share, however, aggregated demographic information with our business partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.
Without your consent we are entitled to share the information stipulated in clause 2 “Collecting Personal Information” with third party companies that perform services, such as email delivery, hosting and payment processing, for the purpose of duly providing you with products and services of the Website and the Game that you request from us. However, these companies will generally only be entitled to use received information in order to provide the services of the Website and the Game that you request from us.
Finally, in the event Freejam combined with another company in the future through a corporate merger, sale, acquisition, liquidation or other similar process, your personal information may be transferred with the business or a part of it, or may be sold as an asset of the business.
Freejam strives to comply with all applicable laws around the globe that are designed to protect your privacy. Although legal requirements may vary from country to country, Freejam intends to adhere to the principles set forth in this Policy even if, in connection with the above, we transfer your Personal Information from your country to countries that may not require an “adequate” level of protection for your Personal Information.
In other words, our goal is to provide protection for your Personal Information no matter where that Personal Information is collected, transferred, or retained. Additionally, in the unlikely event we need to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries, we can, and you authorise us to, disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate. Furthermore, Freejam may also disclose information about you in case Freejam determines that such disclosure is necessary for national security reasons, law enforcement and/or other public importance issues.
