Privacy Policy | Route One
Route One Retail Limited is totally committed to protecting the privacy of our site visitors and customers. The Route One team members are customers themselves of other Internet sites and fully appreciate and respect the importance of privacy on the Internet. We will not disclose information about our customers to third parties except where it is part of providing a service to you - e.g. arranging for a product to be sent to you, carrying out credit and other security checks or where we have your express permission to do so.
Is it safe to order online?
It's safer than it's ever been. We use one of the most secure online ordering systems on the market and are constantly researching and improving our software to make sure we offer the highest possible security at all times. We utilise industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to allow for the encryption of potentially sensitive information such as your name, address and other critically sensitive information like your credit card details. Information passed between your computer and our website cannot be read in the event someone else intercepts it. This technology includes the following features:
Authentication - this assures your browser that your data is being sent to the correct computer server and that the server is secure
Encryption - this encodes the data so that it cannot be read by anyone other than the secure server
Data Integrity - this checks the data being transferred to ensure it has not been altered
Your consent
We will not sell your name, address, e-mail address, credit card information or any of your personal information to any third party (excluding partners from whom you may have linked to our site) without your permission.

What do we use this personal data for?
Depending on how you use our Site, your interactions with us, and the permissions you give us, the purposes for which we use your personal data include:

We rely on the following legal basis, under data protection law, to process your personal data:
Because the processing is necessary to perform a contract with you, or take steps prior to entering into a contract with you (e.g. where you have made a purchase with us, we use your personal data to process the payment and fulfil your order)

Checking your details
If you wish to verify the details you have submitted to Route One or have this data deleted, you may do so by contacting us via the e-mail address or address given below.

We do not make, and do not allow Google to make, any attempt to find out the identities of those visiting our website.
Mailing lists
As part of the registration process for our email newsletters, we collect personal information. We use that information for a couple of reasons: to tell you about stuff you’ve asked us to tell you about; to contact you if we need to obtain or provide additional information; to check our records are right and to check every now and then that you’re happy and satisfied. We don't rent or trade email lists with other organisations and businesses.
