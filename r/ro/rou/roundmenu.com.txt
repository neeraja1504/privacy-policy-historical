Effective Date: November 2016
Careem Networks FZ LLC and/or its affiliates (collectively “Careem”, “we” or “us”) collects information about you when you use our mobile applications, websites, call-centre and other products and services (collectively, the “Services”) and through other interactions and communications you have with us. This privacy policy sets out the basis on which any information, including any personal data, we collect from you, or you provide to us, will be processed by Careem. Each time you access or use the Services or provide us with information, by doing so you are accepting and consenting to the practices described in this privacy policy.
Scope and Application
This privacy policy (this “privacy policy") applies to persons anywhere in the world who access or use our Services (“Users”) as well as to drivers, partner transportation companies, or any other persons who use the Careem platform under license (collectively “Captains”).
Collection of Information
Information You Provide to Us
We collect information you provide directly to us through your access or use of the Services, such as when you create or modify your account, request on-demand services, contact customer support, or otherwise communicate with us. This information may include: your name, email address, phone number, postal address, profile picture, payment method, financial and credit card information, and other information you choose to provide.
Please note that we do not knowingly collect, keep or maintain personal information from children under the age of 18 through the Services, as we require that all users represent to us that they are at least 18 years old.
Information We Collect Through Your Use of Our Services
When you use our Services, we collect personal information (i.e. information that could be used to contact you directly such as full name, postal address, phone number, credit/debit card information, or email address) (“Personal Information”) and demographic information (i.e. information that you submit, or that we collect, that is not personal information; this may include, but is not limited to, post code, hometown, gender, username, device information, including the type of mobile device you use, a unique device identifier (for example, your device's IMEI number, the MAC address of the device's wireless network interface, or the mobile phone number used by the device), mobile network information, your mobile operating system, the type of mobile browser you use, time zone setting, device location, IP address, SMS data, transaction information, age/birth date, browsing history information, searching history information, and registration history information) (“Demographic Information” and, together with Personal Information, “Personal Data”).
We also use GPS technology to determine your current location. Some of our location-enabled Services require your personal data for the feature to work. If you wish to use the particular feature, you will be asked to consent to your data being used for this purpose.
Information We Collect From Other Sources
We may also receive information from other sources and combine that with Personal Data we receive from you or collect through our Services. For example:
If you choose to link, create, or log in to your Careem account with a payment provider or social media service (e.g., Facebook), or if you engage with a separate app or website that uses our API (or whose API we use), we may receive information about you or your connections from that site or app.
If your employer uses one of our enterprise solutions, we may receive information about you from your employer.
When you request on demand services, our Captains may provide us with a User rating after providing services to you.
If you also interact with our Services in another capacity, for instance as a Captain, we may combine or associate that information with Personal Data we have collected from you in your capacity as a User or rider.
Use of Personal Data
We may use Personal Data which you provide to us or we collect from you to:

By submitting your Personal Data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.
