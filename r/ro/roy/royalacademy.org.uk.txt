How the RA manages your personal data
What personal data we collect
We may collect personal information about you when you engage with us for a number of reasons including when you book or buy a ticket, become a member, enquire about our activities and services, engage with our social media, make a donation, sign up to receive emails, create an online account, purchase something from us, register for an event, enter the Summer Exhibition or loan a work of art to us, or otherwise provide us with personal information that may be used by the RA to deliver its charitable services, enable us to provide a service to you or to enhance your experience with us.
This can include information such as your name, postal address, email address, phone number, age, bank details and credit/debit card details. Where you have made a donation to us, we will also ask you if you are a tax payer and would like us to claim gift-aid on your donation, and record this information so that we can claim the gift-aid. We will also record where you tell us not to claim gift aid.
In addition to your personal data, we may also ask for your preferences so that we can send you information that is tailored to your interests.
On occasion, we may receive information about you from third parties, for example if we have run a joint competition with a third party or we have received a personal recommendation that you may be interested in the work of the RA.
We do not usually collect ‘sensitive personal data’ from you unless there is a clear reason for doing so, such as where we need this information to ensure that we provide appropriate facilities or support, to enable you to enjoy everything we offer across the RA. Examples of sensitive personal data we may hold would be in relation to the courses and classes we run for people with dementia.
Potential new supporters and donors
We may collect information on potential supporters or donors who might be interested in becoming involved or increasing their involvement with the RA (for example publicly available information on art collectors, philanthropists or people with a public profile, from such sources as Debrett’s or Larry’s List), but will only do this where we have a legitimate interest and have carried out a legitimate interest assessment or and/or a privacy impact assessment as required (see below).
Website users
We may also gather information about you from your use of our website, such as which pages are most visited and which events or facilities are of most interest. We will use this information to improve our website and to ensure we provide the best services for our users. Wherever possible we use aggregated or anonymous information which does not identify individual visitors to our website. By submitting your details, you enable us (and where applicable any suppliers we use) to provide you with the goods, services, information, activities or online content you select and any other related services the RA may provide.
The RA website uses cookies to help our website work well and to track information about how people are using it. More information on cookies and how to control the cookies we use can be found on our cookies page on our website.
If you register on our website then the following will also apply:
• The website will collect personal information when you register with us;
• The website will collect such information as your name, email address and post code. Once you register with the website you will not be anonymous to us when you subsequently sign in;
• You endeavour to ensure that any registration information you give to the RA will always be accurate, correct and up to date;
• We collect and retain information about your transactions with us so that we can process your transactions and deal with future queries;
• Through the use of cookies, we will receive information from your computer such as your IP address (the unique number that identifies your computer when you use the internet) and we may record this information to provide you with a good experience when browsing our website or to improve the functionality of our site.
Job applicants
If you apply to work at the RA, we will only use the information you give us to process your application and to monitor recruitment statistics. If we want to disclose information to someone outside the RA, for example, if we need a reference, we will make sure we tell you beforehand, unless we are required to disclose this information by law.
If you are unsuccessful in your job application, we may hold your personal information for up to 12 months after we’ve finished recruiting for the post you applied for. After this date we will destroy or delete your information. We keep de-personalised statistical information about applicants to develop our recruitment processes, however no individual applicant would be identifiable from this information.
If you commence employment with the RA, your data will be processed in accordance with your employment contract and our other applicable policies.
RA Schools applicants, students and alumni
If you apply to be a student at the RA Schools, we will only use the information you give us to process your application and to monitor applicants’ statistics.
If you are unsuccessful in your application, we will securely archive the information you have provided to us after we have finished the selection process.
If you are successful and enrol as a student of the RA Schools, we will use your data for the purposes of your studentship and will keep your data as a record of our RA Schools students. On graduating from the RA Schools, you will then become part of our RA Schools alumni and we will contact you in relation to alumni and RA Schools activities, unless you tell us you would rather not hear from us.
Under 16’s
We are committed to protecting the privacy of the young people who engage with us through our website, our events and our courses and classes. When we collect data about a child or young person aged under 16, we will make it very clear as to the reasons for collecting this data and how it will be used. If you are under 13 we will ensure we have consent from a parent or guardian.
Your debit card and credit card information
If you use your credit or debit card to donate to us, buy something or pay for a ticket or membership online or over the phone, we will ensure that this is done securely and that we will not keep your details for longer than necessary for the purposes of the transaction.
