What is Personal Data?
Personal Data is any information identifying you or information relating to you that allows us to identify you. This can be either directly or indirectly from that data alone or in combination with other identifiers we possess or can reasonably access.
Personal Data can be factual (for example, a name, email address, location or date of birth) or an opinion about that person’s actions or behaviour.
Personal Data includes Special Categories of Personal Data and pseudonymised Personal Data but excludes anonymous data or data that has had the identity of an individual permanently removed.
Special Categories of Personal Data is information revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or similar beliefs, trade union membership, physical or mental health conditions, sexual life, sexual orientation, and biometric or genetic data. Although Special Categories of Information do not include information about criminal allegations, proceedings or convictions, there are separate safeguards relating to this type of information.
Pseudonymisation or pseudonymised is the replacing of information that directly or indirectly identifies an individual with one or more artificial identifiers or pseudonyms so that the person, to whom the data relates, cannot be identified without the use of additional information which is kept separately and secure.
What types of Personal Data do we collect?
The types of Personal Data that we collect include:
Name;
Age/date of birth;
Contact information and user preference;
Credit and debit card information and payment details;
Contractual details including goods and services provided;
Copies of documents you provide to prove your age or identity;
Device / Electronic identification data (the type of device that you use and unique device identifiers such as your IP address, device’s IMEI number, the MAC address of the device’s wireless network interface, and the mobile phone number, network and operating system used by the device);
Content data (information stored on your device including login information, photos, videos or other digital content, and check-ins);
Location data (some of our platforms utilise GPS technology to determine your current location. Some of our location-enabled services require your personal data for these features to work. If you wish to use this particular feature you will be asked to consent to your data being used for this purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time by disabling Location Data in your settings.);
Usage data (this includes details of your use of any of our apps and your visits to any of our websites including but not limited to traffic data and other communication data, and the resources that you access.);

Your vehicle details and registration number, your representative organisation (if applicable), and image (which may be recorded on CCTV) if your visit us.
We only routinely gather special categories of Personal Data with respect to visitors to The Royal Mint Experience booked on a VIP Tour. Visitors will be required to complete a Health Questionnaire before arriving. These questions are asked in order for us to determine if reasonable adjustments are required and if these can be made in relation to the tour. For example, visitors will be asked if they have a pace maker fitted as magnetic frequencies are in operation in some of the areas you may visit. Visitors will also be asked if they have a nut allergy as nuts are used in processes that visitors may encounter. Visitors to The Royal Mint Experience may also be asked to provide allergy information when ordering food or attending a catered event.
We do not routinely collect any information about criminal allegations, proceedings or convictions.
We do not routinely collect Personal Data about children under 16. There are a limited number of activities that we undertake which may involve the collection of children’s’ Personal Data, for example competition entries and photo/video permission forms. Where children’s’ Personal Data is processed it will be done so with the consent of whoever holds parental responsibility of the child.
For further information on the types of Personal Data that we hold on you, please contact us.

Credit Account Customers
If you apply for a credit account, we will use credit scoring to assess your application. The credit score will be provided by a credit reference agency. Your credit score will be used by us in conjunction with information that you provide as part of your application, along with information regarding your account conduct (if an existing customer), and official public records such as fraud and insolvency records. The use of credit scoring helps us make fair and responsible lending decisions. If your application for credit is declined you are able to request that this is reconsidered, based on a change of circumstances or a correction of your credit report (if an error was found). The credit scoring used is regularly tested by the professional services provider to ensure that it remains fair, effective and unbiased.
For further information on how to appeal a decision or on the credit scoring service used, please contact us.

Third-party cookies
When you visit our platforms you may notice some cookies that aren’t related to us. If you visit a platform page that contains content which is embedded from other organisations, for example YouTube or Vimeo, you may be sent cookies from these organisations. We do not control these cookies and we would suggest that you visit these organisations’ websites to view information about their cookies and how they are used.
We do have relationships with select suppliers who may also set cookies during your visit to be used for marketing purposes, such as showing you our products depending on what you seem to be interested in.
Social Media sharing
If you share our content with friends through social networks – such as Facebook and Twitter, you may be sent cookies from these platforms. We don't control the setting of these cookies, so we suggest you check the third-party websites for more information about their cookies and how to manage them.
Who might we share your information with?
While most of our work is done by our employees who access your Personal Data directly from our systems which are under our direct control, we do use third-party service providers to perform certain functions on our behalf.
We have listed below examples of the kind of third- party service providers that we work with. We have also listed examples of the types of information that they may have access to and reasons that we may need to share your Personal Data with them.
Order Fulfilment would have access to your personal data including contact information and the goods and services requested. The purpose for this type of transfer being to prepare and deliver the products and/or services that you have requested. This includes where we arrange for delivery of the goods and/or services ordered by you to be made directly from our third party suppliers (also known as a ‘dropshipping’ arrangement).
Payment Processing would have access to your personal data including contact information, credit/debit card information, and payment details. The purpose for this type of transfer being to process your payment for the products or services provided.
Professional Services would have access to your personal data including contact information. The purpose for this type of transfer being to ensure our compliance with our legal obligations (including anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing verification), to assess your suitability for credit (if you have applied for an interest free account), and debt recovery.
Communications and Marketing would have access to your personal data including contact information. The purpose for this type of transfer being to send you information regarding our products and services, analysing data (including removing repetitive or out of date information from customer lists) and providing marketing assistance.
IT Support would have access to the personal data in our custody with which we require support. The purpose for this type of transfer being to resolve IT issues in order to provide the products and services that you have requested.
Data Storage would have access to all the personal data in our custody. The purpose for this type of transfer being to provide us with secure data storage and back-up.
Historical Archiving (The Royal Mint Museum) would have access to your personal data, for example, your name and contact information where you have entered a coin design competition. The purpose for this type of transfer being to keep an historical archive of the work of The Royal Mint.
Such companies and individuals will only have access to the personal data needed to perform these functions, they may not use it for any other purposes and are required to process the data in accordance with data protection laws and regulations applicable in the United Kingdom.
For further information on which service providers may have access to your personal data, please contact us.
We will only share your Personal Data with third parties for their own purposes in very limited and specific circumstances.
This will predominately be where you have given your consent at the time of supplying your personal data. For example, we may pass that data to a third party with whom we are collaborating with where you have registered your interest in the product or service. This would be to allow them to send you updates on the product or service and advise you on availability.
Please note that if we are requested by the police, government, regulatory, or other body investigating suspected illegal activities to provide your personal data and/or user details, we are entitled to do so.
Do we transfer information between countries?
www.royalmint.com
It may sometimes be necessary to transfer your personal data overseas. When this is needed your personal data may be transferred to countries or territories outside of the EEA. Any transfers made will be in full compliance with all aspects of the data protection laws and regulations applicable in the United Kingdom.
We may only transfer your personal data outside the EEA if one of the following conditions applies:
The European Commission has issued a decision confirming that the country to which we transfer personal data ensures an adequate level of protection for the data subject’s rights and freedoms: http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/adequacy/index_en.htm ;
Appropriate safeguards are in place such as binding corporate rules (BCR), model contractual clauses, an approved code of conduct or a certification mechanism;
You have provided your explicit consent to the transfer after being informed of any potential risks; or
The transfer is necessary for one of the other reasons set out in the GDPR including the performance of a contract between us and you, reasons of public interest, to establish, exercise or defend legal claims, to fulfil our legal or regulatory obligations, or to protect your vital interests where you’re physically or legally incapable of giving consent and, in some limited cases, for our legitimate interests.
For further information on which countries your personal data may be transferred to and the specific safeguards that are in place, contact us.
www.royalmintbullion.com
Same details as for www.royalmint.com.
We envisage that we will transfer your personal data to the United States of American and Serbia. This is because we utilise an IT support and data storage provider that is based in the United States of America and this information can also be accessed by a support team based in Serbia. Any transfers are made in full compliance with all aspects of the data protection laws and regulations applicable in the United Kingdom. Model contractual clauses are utilised in this instance to safeguard your Personal Data.
How long do we keep hold of your information?
We keep your Personal Data for as long as we need it to satisfy our business and legal requirements; if you hold a customer account normally this is no longer than 6 years after your cease holding an account. Once Personal Data is no longer required, it is either deleted or anonymised.
It is important to note that all employees at The Royal Mint follow an organisation-wide security policy. Only employees authorised are provided access to Personal Data and these employees will have agreed to ensure confidentiality of this information.
Also specifically with respect to debit and credit card information submitted through our websites, we use secure socket layer technology to protect that information.
What rights do I have in relation to the Personal Data you hold about me?
Unless subject to an exemption, you have the following rights with respect to your Personal Data:
The right to request a copy of your Personal Data which The Royal Mint holds about you;
The right to request that we correct any Personal Data if it is found to be inaccurate or out of date;
The right to request your Personal Data is erased where it is no longer necessary for us to retain such data;
