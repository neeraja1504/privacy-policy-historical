Royal Albert Hall as a Charity
We do not receive any annual government funding so we rely on donations to support investment in our building and the expansion of our Education & Outreach programme.
You can opt in to receive information about supporting the Royal Albert Hall when you register on our website or by logging in to your account and updating your preferences. You can also tell our Box Office team or one of the Philanthropy team over the phone or in person.
We will keep you up to date on the different ways that you can support the Royal Albert Hall, such as philanthropic donations, joining the Friends & Patrons Scheme or through our Legacy scheme. We will also send you information on relevant campaigns, how you can make a difference and invitations to supporter events.
Based on the frequency of your visits and other personal information you provide, we may promote our Friends & Patrons Schemes to you or ask you for additional philanthropic support for our work. We do not use wealth screening companies to analyse our data.
We want to ensure communications to our existing and future supporters are personal and relevant so that we can continue to deliver unforgettable experiences for everyone and cost-effectiveness for the charity. We may analyse our database and the personal information you have provided and add publicly available information to create a profile of interests so that we can better understand your interests and tailor any invitations or communication. This will include geographic and demographic information, full name, postal address, past donations and ability to support us, ticket history and information in the public realm e.g. Companies House, Charity Commission, professional biographies, Directorships, articles/newspapers and Social Media profiles. The more personal the contact, the faster we are able to raise funds to support the Royal Albert Hall charity.
We know that our donors would expect us to have an understanding of who they are and gauged their level of interest in the Hall before approaching them. To meet this expectation, we research existing and potential supporters by analysing our database. This research will include audience members’ ticket history, address and previous donations as well as publicly available information (including newspaper articles, listed Directorships, social media profiles and biographies on employers’ websites).
If you do not wish us to process your information in this way, you have the right to opt out and can do so by contacting the Philanthropy team on 020 7070 4444 or philanthropy@royalalberthall.com.
