Privacy Policy
We respect and are committed to protecting your privacy. That is why we have adopted this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy lets you know how your personal information is processed and used.

The following policies are only in effect for the Web pages, newsletters, discussion lists and opt-in announcement lists owned and operated by Royal Images Catalogue Company. The following discloses our Privacy Policy.
What information are you collecting and how are you collecting it?
Every computer connected to the Internet is given an "Internet Protocol" IP address. When a visitor requests a page from anywhere within the Onemi website, our servers automatically recognize that visitor's domain name and IP address. The domain name and IP address reveal nothing personal about you other than the IP address from which you have accessed our site. We use this information to examine our traffic in aggregate, but do not collect and evaluate this information for individuals. Our servers do not record e-mail addresses of the visitors and the only email addresses collected are those submitted by a visitor upon becoming a member of Onemi, which are required for membership, however these are not used for anything other than the normal purposes of being a Onemi member, such as our infrequent newsletters, competition results and the likes, no email address would ever be used for any other purpose.
What are Cookies?
A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies do not damage your computer system. The only cookie system Onemi implements is in the form of a hit counter in order to see how many daily visitors we have, some of our advertisers may also implement cookie systems, to identify which areas of our websites you have visited, so that the next time you visit, those pages may be readily accessible. Our advertisers may also use cookies to ascertain how many times you've seen an advertisement.

What other information do you request?
We may also request your e-mail address or mailing address for the purposes of security or to provide additional services (for example, subscriptions to the Onemi e-mail newsletter, announcement list or for the directory). Whenever we request the identity of a visitor, we will clearly indicate the purpose of the inquiry before the information is requested. We maintain a zero tolerance "No-Spam" policy that means that we do not intend to sell, rent, or otherwise give your e-mail address to a third-party, without your consent. In addition, Onemi will not send you email that you have not agreed to receive. We may from time to time send an e-mail announcing new Onemi products and services. If you choose to supply your postal address in an online form, your email address will not be used for mailings unless you specifically ask for that.
When you enter a contest or other promotion, we may ask for your name, address, and e-mail address so we can administer the contest and notify winners. Again, it will not be used in any other way but to inform you if you have won or not!
What information do you collect when I purchase something?
If you purchase anything from Onemi website, we need to know your name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card number, and expiration date.
