Application of the ten privacy principles – how we treat your personal information
The kind of information we collect
Royal LePage gathers and uses Personal Information in order to provide you with the products and services you have requested, namely: information that is required to effectively market and sell the property of sellers or lessors; to locate, assess, and qualify properties for buyers; to evaluate independent broker applicants; and to otherwise provide professional and competent real estate services to clients as well as to ensure that you are satisfied with the products and services we have provided. Royal LePage may also use your Personal Information to update you about our services and to offer you additional products or services that you may be interested in, so that we may continue to serve your real estate needs.
We may be required to collect your social insurance number if the federal government obligates us to do so pursuant to the Income Tax Act.
If you visit Royal LePage Web sites, we do not collect Personal Information about you unless you provide it. All information that you do provide us with is securely maintained and kept strictly confidential. This Privacy Policy does not apply to aggregated data from which it is not possible to determine the identity of a specific individual. Royal LePage reserves the right to use aggregated data in any way that it determines appropriate.
When you use the “Ask about this listing” feature on the Royal LePage Web site to request more information about a property from an agent, you agree to provide Royal LePage and the agent receiving the request with your browser history (recently performed searches on royallepage.ca, recently viewed listings) along with any searches or listings saved to your account where an account has been set up by you on the Royal LePage Web site.
How we use your information
At Royal LePage we use Personal Information for three general purposes:
To communicate with you in order to provide you with our products and services.
For inclusion in documentation relating to your particular real estate transaction.
Transactional information to monitor our level of service and report back to you to ensure your satisfaction with the provision of such services.
We will only use Personal Information for the purpose that we have disclosed to you. If we want to use your information for a different purpose, we will notify you and ask for your consent first.
When we are permitted to disclose your information
Royal LePage is obliged to keep your Personal Information confidential except under the following circumstances:
(i) When authorized by you
Many of the services offered by Royal LePage require us to obtain Personal Information about you in order to perform the services you have engaged us to provide. We will always obtain consent from you first, and we will never use the information for purposes other than those we have told you about.
You may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to any legal implications (which we will inform you about). In some cases, if you do not consent to our use or disclosure of certain Personal Information, we may be unable to continue to provide all or part of the services you have requested.
(ii) When required by law
The type of information we are legally required to disclose usually relates to government tax reporting requirements. In some cases, however, such as under a court order, we may be required to disclose certain information to persons specified in the court order. We will only provide the specific information requested and only upon being satisfied that the authorities have legitimate grounds to request the information.
(iii) When permitted by law
The legislation has provided certain situations where Royal LePage is legally permitted to disclose Personal Information without your consent. Examples include situations involving the collection of debt in arrears, medical emergencies, or suspicion of illegal activities.
With whom we may share your information
(i) Royal LePage employees
In the course of daily operations, access to sensitive Personal Information is limited to those employees with a legitimate reason for accessing it. As a condition of their employment, Royal LePage employees are required to follow all applicable laws and regulations, including this Privacy Policy. Unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential client information by any Royal LePage employee is prohibited and may result in disciplinary measures.
(ii) Royal LePage affiliates
In order to better meet your needs, we may share some of your Personal Information with our affiliates. We will only do this with your express consent and you may withdraw this consent at any time. The procedure for withdrawing consent is outlined below under the section “Opting Out.”
(iii) Royal LePage third-party suppliers
As you may know, we may engage and coordinate third-party suppliers to provide you with certain services offered through Royal LePage. Such suppliers are only given the information that is needed to provide the specific service for which we contract them to provide. Suppliers are obliged to protect the confidentiality of your Personal Information and are prohibited from doing anything with this information that we have not authorized them to do. They are required to treat your Personal Information in a manner consistent with the Royal LePage Privacy Policy.
If you access Royal LePage Web sites from third-party websites, including any partner or referral sites, you authorize Royal LePage to collect and use any Personal Information about you that you provide to us while visiting Royal LePage Web sites and to share with the third-party any Personal Information collected.  You also authorize any such third-party to use any Personal Information or any content you may provide while using Royal LePage Web sites for preparing, using and distributing statistical, profiling, performance or operation reports.
(iv) Sale of business
We may transfer your personally identifiable information to a third party in connection with a sale, merger, or other disposition (whether of assets, stock, or otherwise) of our business.
How we safeguard information
Royal LePage has extensive controls in place to maintain the security of its information and information systems. Client and independent broker files are stored according to the sensitivity of the information contained therein. Appropriate controls (such as restricted access) are placed on our computer systems and data processing procedures. Physical access to areas where Personal Information is gathered, processed, or stored is limited to authorized employees.
When you telephone a Royal LePage employee to speak about your file, you may be asked for some personally identifying information. This type of safeguard is designed to ensure that only you, or someone authorized by you, has access to your file.
Website security
In order to serve you better, Royal LePage offers clients access to certain information through its websites.
http://www.royallepage.ca provides general information about Royal LePage and the products and services it offers.
The Royal LePage Web site contains links to other Web sites, including those of its business partners. Royal LePage is in no way responsible and cannot guarantee the content or privacy of other sites linked to www.royallepage.ca.
Accessing and amending your information
As a client or Royal LePage broker, you have the right to access the Personal Information we keep in your file and you have the right to verify or amend the information if it is shown to be inaccurate.
