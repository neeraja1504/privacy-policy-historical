We may refuse certain requests that are tediously repetitive, that require too many technical resources, that threaten the privacy of others, or that are very impractical.
We will provide this service to you free-of-charge as long as allowing you to access and revise the data does not occupy too many of our resources. We strive to improve and maintain our services to protect data from being accidentally or maliciously destroyed. Therefore, after you delete data from our server, we may not be able to immediately delete this data or its remaining copies from the server it is being used on, and we may not be able to delete the corresponding data from our backup systems.
4. Information sharing
Except where clearly stipulated elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, we generally do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your Personal Information unless we provide you with advance notice. The term "outside parties" does not include our affiliates and any other parties who assist us in offering Services, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential.
You hereby authorize us to share your Personal Information with third parties without asking for your consent in the following situations:
●In the situation where it is required by law, legal proceedings, lawsuit, or the public and government authorities, we may share your Personal Information with the designated third parties.
