Rocket Lawyer Privacy Policy
Rocket Lawyer collects and uses your personal information to operate our websites and deliver the Services you have requested. Rocket Lawyer may also use your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or services available from Rocket Lawyer and its affiliates. Rocket Lawyer may also contact you to participate in surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered.
Rocket Lawyer does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties. Rocket Lawyer may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party without your express consent.
In addition, Rocket Lawyer may share data with trusted partners to help us perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, perform tasks required to complete a purchase transaction, provide customer support, arrange for deliveries. Rocket Lawyer may also share information on your use of our Site, such as pages visited, links clicked, non-sensitive text entered, and mouse movements, with third party providers of web analytic software in order to enable Rocket Lawyer to improve its services. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these Services, and they are obligated to maintain the confidentiality of your information.
Additionally, if you order our Services through a third party (e.g., GYST), or if you order our Services through a co-branded web page (e.g., ADP + Rocket Lawyer), Rocket Lawyer may share personal information and information about your use of our Services with the third party to enable them to contact you regarding their products and/or services. In such cases, the third party's use of information furnished by Rocket Lawyer is governed by their privacy policy.
Rocket Lawyer keeps track of the pages our customers visit within our websites in order to determine what Services are the most popular. This data is used to deliver customized content and advertising within the websites we operate to users whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area. Rocket Lawyer uses tracking pixels to collect information that helps us provide our Service to you. Please note that any "do not track" signals sent by your web browser or other mechanism have no effect on the collection of personally identifiable information by Rocket Lawyer. In addition, other parties who perform data analytics for Rocket Lawyer, such as Google Analytics, may collect personally identifiable information about your online activities when you use our Services. Third party affiliates of Rocket Lawyer may have different policies with respect to "do not track" signals and Rocket Lawyer makes no representations with respect to such policies.
Rocket Lawyer uses tracking to create remarketing audiences of users based on user behavior/their visits to our website. Rocket Lawyer may also target these users with custom ads based on affinities/interests, geographic and demographic signals. Rocket Lawyer only shares browser-level data through third party vendor tracking such as Google Analytics. Users can opt out of these advertising features by visiting Google or resources like the NAI consumer opt-out page. Rocket Lawyer may use email addresses to target users with custom ads through 3rd party advertising platforms. Rocket Lawyer shares customer information with third parties to perform services (advertising) on our behalf.
Rocket Lawyer may disclose personal information when we are required to or we believe it is appropriate to comply with the law (e.g., a lawful subpoena, warrant or court order); to enforce or apply this Privacy Policy or our other policies or agreements; to initiate, render, bill, and collect for amounts owed to us; to protect our or our users' rights, property or safety; to protect our users from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of the Services; or if we believe that an emergency involving the danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires or justifies disclosure of personal information.
Information about our customers, including personal information, may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of company assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which personal information could be transferred to third parties as one of Rocket Lawyer's business assets. In such an event, we will attempt to notify you before your personal information is transferred, but you may not have the right to opt out of any such transfer.
