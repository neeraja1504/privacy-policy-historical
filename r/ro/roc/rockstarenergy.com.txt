We do not, but may in the future, share your Personal Information with non-affiliated third parties so that they may offer, market and advertise products and services directly to you.(b) Disclosure to Co-Sponsors. From time to time, we may co-sponsor (online and offline) events and/or product/service offerings with non-affiliated third parties.

We require that our Service Providers use your information shared by us solely for the purposes of performing their services to us and that they maintain the confidentiality, security and integrity of such information and not further disclose the information to others.w(d) Disclosure Under Other Circumstances. We may disclose your Personal Information and User Activity Information to others if doing so is required by law, or in our good faith belief, is reasonably necessary to comply with any legal process, law enforcement, to enforce this Privacy Policy, respond to an emergency, or protect the rights, property or safety of Rockstar, and/or the public.(e) Unrestricted Disclosure of Aggregate and Anonymous Information.

4. INFORMATION DISCLOSURE: YOUR CHOICES
(a) Opt-Out for Email Marketing. When you register to become a member on our Site or to participate in a Rockstar Sponsored Event, we may provide you with the opportunity to opt out of receiving marketing emails from us at that time. Even if you do not exercise the opt-out choice when you disclose your Personal Information to Rockstar, you may subsequently exercise such choice at any time, by sending your request to us via email at optout.marketing@rockstarenergy.com, or by using the “Unsubscribe” link provided in a marketing email you may have previously received from us. Please note, however, that your opt-out will apply only to marketing and promotional emails from us and will not stop email communications from us relating to your Transaction or Request, such as notice of a material change in this Privacy Policy and/or the Terms and Conditions for our Site, notice of an actual or suspected security breach that affects your Personal Information stored by or for us, etc.Please also note that if the email address or text/mobile number you provide to us is a “wireless” email address (i.e. the address is designated by a wireless service carrier specifically for transmitting emails to a wireless device), we will not send marketing emails to that address without your prior opt-in consent. The FCC has established a list of domain names used by wireless service providers to transmit emails to wireless devices at http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/policy/DomainNameDownload.html  Wireless service providers must add new domain names to this list within 30 days of activating them. If your email address contains a domain name on this list (after the “@” symbol), then we will treat your email address as a wireless email address. However, the mere fact that you can retrieve emails from your regular Internet email account on your mobile/wireless device does not make your Internet email address a “wireless” email address.(b) Opt-Out for Disclosure to Non-Affiliates for Direct Marketing/Advertising Purposes. We do not currently, but may in the future, share your Personal Information with non-affiliated third parties so that they may offer, market and advertise products and services directly to you. You may at any time opt out of such information sharing, by sending your request to us via email at optout.nonaffiliate@rockstarenergy.com. We may also provide you with an opportunity to opt out at the time you register for a Rockstar Sponsored Event, such as by checking an opt-out box on the registration page.
