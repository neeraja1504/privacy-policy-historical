WHAT ARE COOKIES?
Cookies are a feature of Web browser software that allows Web servers to recognize the computer used to access a Web site. They are small pieces of data that are stored by a user’s Web browser on the user’s hard drive. Cookies can remember what information a user accesses on one Web page to simplify subsequent interactions with that Web site by the same user or to use the information to streamline the user’s transactions on related Web pages. This makes it easier for a user to move from Web page to Web page and to complete commercial transactions over the Internet. Cookies should make your online experience easier and more personalized.
HOW DO WE USE INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM COOKIES?
We use Web site browser software tools such as cookies and Web server logs to gather information about Rockdizmusic users’ browsing activities in order to constantly improve Rockdizmusic and better serve our customers. This information assists us to design and arrange our Web pages in the most user-friendly manner and to continually improve Rockdizmusic to better meet the needs of our customers and prospective customers.
Cookies help us collect important business and technical statistics. The information in the cookies lets us trace the paths followed by users to Rockdizmusic as they move from one page to another. Web server logs allow us to count how many people visit Rockdizmusic and evaluate Rockdizmusic’s visitor capacity. We do not use these technologies to capture your individual e-mail address or any personally identifying information about you although they do permit us to send focused online banner advertisements or other such responses to you.
We also allow third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect certain anonymous information when you visit Rockdizmusic.

These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information.

DO WE SECURE INFORMATION TRANSMISSIONS?
When you send confidential personal credit card information to our processors like PayPal and Google, from Rockdizmusic, a secure server software which they have licensed encrypts all information you input before it is sent to them. The information is scrambled en route and decoded once it reaches their Web site.
Other e-mail that you may send to us may not be secure unless we advise you that security measures will be in place prior to your transmitting the information. For that reason, we ask that you do not send confidential information such as Social Security or account numbers to us through an unsecured e-mail.
HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION?
Information Security.
We utilize encryption/security software to safeguard the confidentiality of personal information we collect from unauthorized access or disclosure and accidental loss, alteration or destruction.

Periodically, our operations and business practices are reviewed for compliance with corporate policies and procedures governing the security, confidentiality and quality of our information.
Employee Access, Training and Expectations.
Our corporate values, ethical standards, policies and practices are committed to the protection of customer information. In general, our business practices limit employee access to confidential information, and limit the use and disclosure of such information to authorized persons, processes and transactions.
DO WE DISCLOSE INFORMATION TO OUTSIDE PARTIES?
We may provide aggregate information about our customers, sales, Web site traffic patterns and related Web site information to our affiliates or reputable third parties, but this information will not include personally identifying data, except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy.
WHAT ABOUT LEGALLY COMPELLED DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION?
