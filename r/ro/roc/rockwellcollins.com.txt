The steps we take to protect your personal information and how you can review and correct your personal information are also covered here. By accessing our Sites, you are consenting to the information collection and use practices described in this policy.

Information collected automatically.
We collect information about your visit to our Sites, including what pages you view, the date and time you access the site, the number of bytes transferred, links you click, the materials you access, and other actions taken within Rockwell Collins' Sites.

Information from other sources
We may obtain information about you from other sources, such as where your employer supplies your contact details though our customer portal. If you make an application for employment with us or accept employment with us, we may obtain information from third parties, including, to the extent permitted by applicable law, recruiters, employment research firms, identity verification services, the references you provide to us, websites and other publicly accessible information on the Internet. We may also receive information you submit to us through third-party websites, including through LinkedIn, and other publicly available sources.

Use of information

In order to offer you a more consistent experience in your interactions with Rockwell Collins, information collected by our Sites may be combined with information we collect by other means.
Website improvement. We may use your personal information to improve our Sites and related Rockwell Collins products and services, or to make our Sites easier to use by eliminating the need for you to repeatedly enter the same information or by customizing our Sites to your particular preferences or interests.
Employment applications. We ask you for personal information in connection with a job application or inquiry, such as information about yourself, a resume or curriculum vitae. We may use this information throughout Rockwell Collins and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates for the purpose of employment consideration. We will keep the information for future consideration unless you direct us not to do so. If you accept a position with Rockwell Collins, we will retain this information as part of the employment relationship.
Employee portal.   If you are a Rockwell Collins employee or contractor, we may offer portals or other pages on the Site to serve as a central resource for human resources functions and other functions related to the employment relationship. We may use your personal information to manage your rights, benefits, insurance plans, pensions, absences, compensation, training, leadership development, travel and other employment functions. We may also use your personal information, where permitted, for diversity monitoring, ethics and other compliance requirements. You may have the option to create an employee profile which is included in company directories and allows you to communicate and share information with other Rockwell Collins employees and contractors.
Sharing of information
Disclosure of your personal information. Except as described below, personal information you provide to Rockwell Collins through our Sites will not be shared outside of Rockwell Collins and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates without your permission.
Disclosure to service providers. Rockwell Collins contracts with other companies to provide services on our behalf, such as hosting Sites, sending out information, processing transactions, and analyzing our Sites. We provide these companies with only those elements of your personal information they need to deliver those services. These companies and their employees are prohibited from using that personal information for any other purpose.
Disclosure to distributors. In responding to a request made by you, we may share your personal information with companies that distribute our products or services. In those cases, we provide these companies with only those elements of your personal information they need to respond to your request, and these companies and their employees are prohibited from using that personal information for any other purpose. In some cases, we may seek your permission to share your information with distributors for marketing purposes other than responding to a request from you. However, we will not share your information for such marketing purposes unless we have obtained your express consent to do so.
Disclosure on employee and applicant portals. If you apply for a position with Rockwell Collins through our online portal, or use the portal as an employee or contractor, some personal information will be made available to Rockwell Collins, Inc. to administer the Sites and manage group functions, as well as with any other group company with whom you make an application, for whom you are employed, or with whom you communicate.
Disclosure in connection with transactions. In connection with certain transactions, we may disclose some or all of your personal information to financial institutions, government entities, and shipping companies or postal services involved in fulfillment.
Disclosure in connection with acquisitions or divestitures. Circumstances may arise where for strategic or other business reasons Rockwell Collins decides to sell, buy or otherwise reorganize businesses in some countries. Such a transaction may involve disclosure of personal information to prospective or actual purchasers, or receiving it from sellers. It is Rockwell Collins' practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions.
Disclosure for other reasons. We may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with legal requirements or with legal process served on us, to protect and defend our rights or property, or in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of any individual.
Security
Rockwell Collins is committed to protecting the security of your personal information.

For Sites to which you log in, it is your responsibility to ensure the security of your password and not to reveal this information to others. When you move around a site to which you have logged in, or from one site to another that uses the same login mechanism, we verify your identity by means of an encrypted cookie placed on your machine.

Cookie Statement
Last updated September 2017
What is a cookie?
A cookie is either a small text file that is stored on your hard drive, or some information that is stored in memory until you close your browser. Any given website can store and read only its own cookies; it cannot read a cookie set by another website, nor can it inject information into cookies set by other websites.
What is its purpose?
A cookie helps website operators monitor usage of their website, and it also enables them to provide a secure personalized browsing experience for their users. In addition, cookies are often used on eCommerce websites to facilitate the shopping experience.
Rockwell Collins uses or may use cookies in the following ways:
To store session information while users are browsing its websites.
To enable more accurate reporting of site usage data, such as new visitors, unique visitors and returning visitors.
To enable targeted content to be served on its sites or other third party sites based on your browsing history (see privacy considerations below).
What kind of cookies do we use?
Strictly necessary cookies: we use strictly necessary cookies to facilitate the correct navigation of the website and portal as well as to ensure that content loads effectively. These cookies are essential to providing the services or any features you have requested.
Performance cookies: we use cookies that track aggregate statistics related to our page views and the navigation of visitors to our online services. The information we collect enables us to improve the quality of your online experience, through assisting us in building user-friendly and trouble-shooting issues.
Functionality cookies: we use functionality cookies to remember choices you make (such as language preference, country location, or other online settings) and provide the personalized or enhanced features that you select. Our functionality cookies can be used to provide online services to you, or to prevent online services from being offered to you if you previously indicated you did not want to receive such services. We do not use functionality cookies to identify you; however, we may use these cookies to track your browsing across our websites and online portal.
Third-party cookies: We may use third party cookies for marketing and analytics purposes. These are cookies that are managed by a domain name different from Rockwell Collins, including:
Google Inc.: for the purpose of providing its Google Analytics service, which allows Rockwell Collins to understand how users interact with the website.
Siteimprove: for the purpose of collecting data that helps Rockwell Collins understand how users interact within the website.
MultiView, Inc.: for the purpose of providing targeted advertising on behalf of Rockwell Collins as you browse other websites.
LinkedIn: for the purpose of helping Rockwell Collins understand the effectiveness of its posts and advertising on the LinkedIn website.
Cookies and your privacy
A cookie cannot read data from elsewhere on your computer; thus, it cannot steal any personally identifiable information about you. A cookie could store your personal information only if you had first entered it into a Web form and then the operators of the website chose to store it as part of the cookie. Rockwell Collins may request and store personal information to customize your experience on our sites. We will never share this information with third parties without your consent, except where required by law.
As stated earlier, a given website cannot read cookies set by other websites. However, websites can include content, such as banner images, from third-party sites that set their own cookies. Subsequently, other sites that you visit that include content from the same third-party site may be customized based on your previous browsing history. In this manner, it may appear as though these sites have read your cookies, but it is really because of the third-party cookie.
Example: You visit an automaker's website, and that site includes content from a third-party site that sets its own cookie. Subsequently, you visit other websites that incorporate content from the same third party. The third-party website knows that you looked at cars on the automaker's website and thus may show ads featuring that automaker’s vehicles.
Controlling cookies
Rockwell Collins recognizes its users' privacy concerns. You may choose to reject cookies either outright, or on a case-by-case basis. However, please be aware that our applications and websites may require you to accept cookies in order to use some or all of their features.
If you wish to withdraw your consent to this Cookies Policy at any time, you should delete the cookies stored on your device via the settings and configurations on your internet browser.
You can allow, block or delete installed cookies on your computer by configuring the options of the web browser installed on your computer. For more information, refer to the following links.
