Data transmitted through the contact form will be stored on servers located in Germany. We use the data you provide to us to process your inquiries. Depending on the purpose we may collect and store title, name, company, job title, address, gender, date of birth, phone number, and email address. Unless specifically stated, we store personal data only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes pursued.
Investor Relations subscription
If you register for our Investor Relations updates, we will use your email address to regularly inform you about Rocket Internet SE and its companies, including but not limited to the company newsletter, corporate news, investor relations related information and invitations to events of Rocket Internet and its companies. Mandatory for receiving these information are the following data: name, address, email address, job title and company. Further data can be added voluntarily such as title and phone number.
To ensure that you are properly registered, that is, to prevent unauthorized subscriptions on behalf of third parties, we will use a double-opt-in process and send you a confirmation e-mail after your first Investor Relations subscription; this e-mail will request you to confirm the subscription.
The registration is based on the following statement: “I would like to receive information about Rocket Internet and its companies, including but not limited to the company newsletter, corporate news, investor relations related information and invitations to events of Rocket Internet and its companies via email. To unsubscribe at any time I can use the cancellation link provided in each email.”
The legal basis for this is your consent in accordance with Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 a GDPR. In connection with your registration, we also store your IP address plus the date and time of registration and confirmation, so that we can trace and prove the registration at a later date. The legal basis for this storage is a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR, where the legitimate interest is in being able to prove the registration. We will store your email address for sending you the regular updates by email until you unsubscribe or we stop sending these updates to you. The data collected by us during the subscription will be used exclusively for promotional and informational purposes by means of the company updates.
You may object at any time via the cancellation link in the provided emails or by sending a message to our contact address indicated above without incurring any costs. After cancellation, your email address will be removed from our distribution list, as far as you have not expressly consented to a further use of your data or we reserve the right to further data usage, which is permitted by law and about which we inform you in this statement.
