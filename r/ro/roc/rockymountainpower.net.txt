Privacy
Rocky Mountain Power sometimes partners with company affiliates or nonaffiliated third parties that provide services on the Company's behalf that are necessary to complete a customer-requested transaction. Under these limited circumstances, these third party relationships will be invisible to you as a customer. However, you have our assurance that your personal account information will be provided the same protections you experience directly with Rocky Mountain Power. The information shared is limited to that necessary to deliver the service authorized or requested by the customer and generally consists of name, account number, mailing address and phone number.
Rocky Mountain Power may disclose information to companies that perform marketing services on the Company's behalf or to other financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements. These companies are subject to confidentiality agreements with Rocky Mountain Power and other legal restrictions that prohibit them from using the information except to market the specified Rocky Mountain Power-related products or services. The information shared is limited to information we receive from you on applications or other forms, such as name, account number, mailing address and phone number.
There are times when Rocky Mountain Power is required to furnish information concerning present or former customers to regulatory agencies who audit the Company’s filings in rate cases, to government agencies or in response to a subpoena, warrant, court order, levy, attachment or other comparable legal process; however, Rocky Mountain Power endeavors to cause the party receiving such information to agree to maintain the confidentiality of the information.
We or our third-party service providers also collect IP addresses and related information such as: originating and destination information; date and time stamps of communications; indicators of the type of operating system; hypertext protocol headers; application client and server banners; and information about the type of request, such as whether it is requesting or sending data. We or our third-party service providers organize and analyze these types of information to support our internal operations, including maintaining functionality of the websites and diagnosing website issues, analyzing trends, providing more efficient service, maintaining and/or enhancing security for users and the websites, producing traffic volume statistics, and making the websites and our infrastructure more useful and secure. In an effort to protect the security of our critical infrastructure, any use of a website or information relating to such use (as described above) may be monitored and disclosed to federal authorities or agencies without further notice to you.
