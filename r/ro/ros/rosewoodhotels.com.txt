Last Updated: 18 May 2018
Effective Date: 24 May 2018
Recent Changes to Our Privacy Policy
The privacy and security of your information is very important to us. We have made material changes to the Privacy Policy that apply with respect to information that you provide on or after the date indicated in the “Last Updated” legend above. These changes include:
(1) Detailed information regarding what personal data and other information we collect from you, how we collect it, and how it is used;
(2) Further descriptions of the parties with whom and for what purposes your data is shared.
To learn more, please review the full Privacy Policy below.
Rosewood Hotel Group and its affiliates (collectively, “ Rosewood ”, “ we ”, “ our ” or “ us ”) are committed to safeguarding your privacy and want you to be familiar with how we collect, disclose and otherwise use information about you. References in this Privacy Policy to “ Rosewood ,” “ we ,” “ our ” or “ us ” are references to the entity responsible for the processing of your personal data, which generally is the entity that obtains your personal data in the respective case, or the data controller.
This Privacy Policy describes:
our practices in connection with the information we collect from you when you visit our websites that link to this Privacy Policy (the “Site”), or when you use any applications made available by us on or through computers and mobile devices (the “Apps”),
when we communicate with you through e-mail messages that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, including the Site and Apps, referred to as the “Services”);
our privacy practices when we communicate with you by offline channels, such as when you provide your information to our call centers, or in person (“Offline Services”); and
the basis on which we will process personal data we collect from you or that you provide to us, and your choices with respect to that data.
This Privacy Policy excludes those websites and online services that have separate privacy policies and do not incorporate this Privacy Policy by reference or otherwise. This Privacy Policy also does not apply to hotels that are managed (rather than owned) by us. For example, a hotel may use e-mail or other methods of marketing communication to contact their guests and they are solely responsible for these communications. Please see the hotel’s privacy notice to understand how it will treat your information. Different privacy policies also may apply to other parts of our web presence – for example, web pages for online recruitment.
Our privacy practices may be more or less limited in certain countries in which we operate to reflect local practices and legal requirements. We will specifically inform you, if this is the case.
By providing your personal data and other information through our Services, you acknowledge that your personal data will be processed pursuant to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If any term in this Privacy Policy is unacceptable to you, please do not use the Services or provide any personal data.
