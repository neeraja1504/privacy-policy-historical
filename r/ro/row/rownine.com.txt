This privacy policy describes how Beyond the Rack (“BTR”) collects and uses the personal information you provide on our Website: www.beyondtherack.com (“the Website”) for your use of the services, features and content offered by Beyond the Rack (collectively referred to as the “BTR Services”). It also describes the choices available to you regarding the use of your personal information and how you can access and update your personal information. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, unless otherwise noted, all references to "Beyond the Rack" include beyondtherack.com and BTR.
Beyond the Rack is committed to protecting all the information you share with us. We follow stringent procedures to help protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of data stored on BTR systems.
Only those employees who need access to your information in order to perform their duties are allowed such access. Any employee who violates our privacy and/or security policies is subject to disciplinary action, including possible termination and civil and/or criminal prosecution.
We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy. We do not sell your personal information to third parties.
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place physical, electronic and managerial procedures to protect the information we collect online. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. Please note, however, that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on the Website, you can contact us at security@beyondtherack.com.

If you have questions or concerns regarding this privacy policy, you should first contact Customer Service. If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should contact TRUSTe here. TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with Beyond the Rack to address your concerns.
The TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through the Website.
The information Beyond the Rack gathers falls into two categories:
Personally identifiable information, which includes personal information you supply when you register, order, complete a survey, enter a contest, provide your email address or provide your friends’ emails addresses and
Non-personally identifiable information collected through technology, which includes tracking information collected as you navigate the Website.
Personally Identifiable Information That You Provide Us
Registration for the BTR Services requires that you supply certain personally identifiable information, including, in most cases, your first name, your last name, a unique email address and a password to register. This allows BTR to provide you access to your account every time you visit the Website. Beyond the Rack keeps track of your information to offer you the best possible shopping experience.
To enable the purchase of products, we also collect and store billing and credit card information as well as your address, telephone number or any other information required to process your order.
This information may be disclosed to specific members of our staff and to select third parties (such as our credit card processor and shipping provider) involved in the completion of your transaction and delivery of your order. Examples of this include fulfilling orders and processing credit card payments service providers.
We will also use your email address to notify you about new services, special promotional programs, promotional offers or any information related to BTR Services.
At any time, you can notify us that you wish to stop receiving these emails by either:
Making the appropriate selections in your account management center, or
Following the "unsubscribe" instructions located near the bottom of each email, or
Contacting us at unsubscribe@beyondtherack.com requesting that we remove your email from our database. To do so please include your email in the body of your email, and put "Unsubscribe" in the subject line, or
Calling our toll-free number at 1-877-733-4660 on weekdays, between 8AM - 8PM ET and weekends between 10AM - 2PM ET.
In addition, we keep a record of your past purchases, returns, and credits. We may also ask you for information regarding your personal preferences and demographics to better meet your needs.
The Website is targeted for use by a general audience; BTR does not market to or create special areas for use by children. Accordingly, BTR does not collect age identifying information nor does BTR knowingly collect any personal information, even in aggregate, from children under the age of 13 years. However, we hereby advise all visitors to the Website under the age of 13 not to disclose or provide any personally identifiable information on the Website. In the event that we discover that a child under the age of 13 has provided personally identifiable information to BTR, in accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protect Act (see the Federal Trade Commission's website), we will delete the child's personally identifiable information from our files and databases to the extent technologically possible.
You may choose to log-on, create an account or enhance your profile at beyondtherack.com with the Facebook Connect feature on the Website. By doing this, you are asking Facebook to send us registration information from your Facebook profile. We treat that information as we do any other information you give to us when you log on, register or create a profile. After you have connected, Facebook also sends us additional information from your profile that allows us to display a Facebook module on the pages you view. We do not store this additional information.
Beyond the Rack collects personal information such as your first name, your last name, a unique email address and a password from readers in connection with optional sweepstakes, contests or special offers. If this information is to be shared with a third party other than Beyond the Rack, we will notify you at the time of collection. If you do not want any personal information shared, you may always decline to participate in the sweepstakes, contest or special offer.
Beyond the Rack may collect personal information such as your first name, your last name, a unique email address and a password as well as your opinion on specific BTR services from members in connection with voluntary surveys. Data may be collected on the Website, on the phone or through the mail. The information you provide by answering optional survey questions may be shared, but only in the aggregate, with advertisers and partners unless we notify you otherwise at the time of collection.
If your personal identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our services, you may correct, update, delete/deactivate it by either:
Making the necessary changes in your member information page, or
Emailing our Customer Service team at privacy@beyondtherack.com, or
Calling our toll-free number at 1-877-733-4660 on weekdays, between 8AM - 8PM ET and weekends between 10AM - 2PM ET, or

Non-Personally Identifiable Information Collected Using Technology
Device Information: We may collect information about the computer, mobile telephone, smartphone or other device you use to access the Website.
Some of the services and advertisements included in the BTR Services, including on beyondtherack.com, are delivered or served by third-party companies that may place or recognize cookies, Web beacons or other technology to track certain non-personally identifiable information about the Website users. For example, in the course of serving certain advertisements, some advertisers may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser in order to collect certain information about your use of the BTR Services. In many cases, this information could be used to show you ads based on your interests on other websites.
Please note that we do not have access to, nor control over, advertisers' or service providers' cookies or how they may be used.
The Website also transmits non-personally identifiable Website usage information about visitors to the servers of reputable third parties. To do this, BTR uses Web Beacons in conjunction with cookies provided by our third-party ad server vendors.
The purpose is to recognize you, provide personalization, improve your shopping experience, save you time, help us understand where our visitors are going and how much time they spend there, as well as to target internet banner advertisements on other sites. You will not be able to access certain areas of the Website, if your computer does not accept cookies from beyondtherack.com.
A cookie is a small piece of information that is stored on a computer for the purpose of identifying that browser during interaction on the websites. Cookies may be used to store items such as identifiers and user preferences. A website may set a cookie to the browser if the browser's preferences allow it. A browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has set, not those set by other websites.
A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your computer for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following the directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file. If you reject cookies, you may still use the Website, but your ability to use some areas of the Website may be limited.
BTR uses third party vendors to store cookies on your computer when you first visit the Website in order to enable BTR to recognize you each time you come back to the Website. Our third party vendors use both session ID cookies and/or persistent cookies. Through cookies BTR can customize the Website to your individual preferences in order to create a more personalized and convenient user experience.
Please note that cookies stored on your computer through the Website or BTR email campaigns do not store personally identifiable information about you or your finances.
Our third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on your prior visits to the Website.
For example, Google is one of the companies that serve advertisements for beyondtherack.com. The DoubleClick DART cookie is used by Google in the ads served on the websites of its partners, such as websites displaying AdSense ads or participating in Google certified ad networks. When users visit a partner's website and either view or click on an ad, a cookie may be dropped on that end user's browser. The data gathered from these cookies will be used to help better serve and manage ads on the Website and across the Web. You may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy.

We also use Google conversion tracking to measure the conversion rate related to our Google AdWords campaigns. This allows Google to tell us how users find the Website using Google. To protect the user's privacy Google’s cookie is not personally-identifiable and expires in 30 days. If you want to disable conversion tracking cookies, you can set your browser to block cookies from the googleadservices.com domain.

A web beacon is an object that is embedded in a web page or e-mail and is usually invisible to the user but allows checking that a user has viewed a specific page of the Website or e-mail.

Web beacons can be small (usually 1×1 pixel) transparent GIF or PNG with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, embedded in an HTML page, usually a page on the web or the content of an e-mail, used to know if a user has completed a specific action like registering or placing an order. We do not tie the information gathered by web beacons to our customers’ personally identifiable information.
