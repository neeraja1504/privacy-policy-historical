Updated as of August, 2019
At Hotel JV Services, LLC (“Roomkey” or the “Company”) our goal is to deliver you a positive hotel shopping experience. We collect, store, and use certain data about you to facilitate that goal.
This Privacy Policy describes the personal data we may collect about you, how we may use and disclose that data, and the choices you can make about how we collect and use your data.
By visiting and using this website, you agree to our collection, processing, and transfer of your personal data as described in this Privacy Policy. Please do not use our Website if you disagree with any part of this Privacy Policy.
Information We Collect About You
When you visit our website, we collect your IP address, your browser type, your operating system, and the length of time and the pages you accessed on our website. Roomkey may also collect information relating to the hotels you reviewed on our site and what advertising you may have seen. Roomkey may also know what website you visited before or after you exit from our website.
We may directly collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools and services, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service.

From time to time, we may send you marketing emails or advertising that is based on your interests based on how you have used our site.
