The cookies do not store any personally identifiable information about you. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can modify your browser settings to disable cookies. If you choose to disable cookies, you will still be able to access our Sites, but you may not have full use of all the features we offer.

Without restricting our rights to do as noted above, generally we will not disclose your information unless we believe in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to protect Rook’s rights.
In the event of the sale of our business, merger, consolidation, asset sale, or bankruptcy, we reserve the right to disclose your information to third parties for business reasons.

Information Retention & Security
Rook stores your information for no less than one year from the time of initial submission, as well as automated personal information we collect about you and shall retain the information for as long as appropriate to carry out the purpose for which it was collected or to comply with applicable laws, contracts, rules and regulations.
Rook takes appropriate security measures to protect our users’ information against unauthorized access, loss, alteration, or destruction. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as digital encryption and physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal information. We want you to feel confident using our Sites to transact business. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure. You transmit data, including personal information to us at your own risk.
Control of Your Access Credentials
You are responsible for all actions taken using your login email and password. This will be the case whether or not you specifically authorized such activities. Rook will never ask you for your password. We highly encourage you to change your password regularly.
Modifications
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. We reserve the right to modify it at any time, so please check it frequently. If we make any material changes to our Privacy Policy, all amended terms will automatically be effective 30 days after the initial changes have been posted to this Privacy Policy. Your continued use of our Sites after we have posted any Privacy Policy changes indicates your agreement to the changes.

If applicable, this information would include the categories of customer information and the names and addresses of those businesses with which we shared customer information for the immediately prior calendar year (e.g., requests made in 2014 will receive information regarding 2013 sharing activities).
To obtain this information from Rook, please send an email message to privacy@RookMedia.net with “Request for California Privacy Information” on the subject line and in the body of your message.
