If you provide us with personal information through role-editor.com you can be assured that it will only be used in accordance with this privacy statement.
Website Visitors
Like most website operators, role-editor.com collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. role-editor.com’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how role-editor.com’s visitors use it.
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to role-editor.com choose to interact with role-editor.com in ways that require role-editor.com to gather personally-identifying information. For example, we ask visitors who buy membership to provide a username and email address.
In each case, role-editor.com collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with role-editor.com. role-editor.com does not disclose personally-identifying information. Visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities, like purchasing a User Role Editor Pro membership.
