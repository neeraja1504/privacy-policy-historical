Location Information Safeguards (from using your information)
If you have chosen services that disclose your location or the location of your vehicle, we take the confidentiality of that information very seriously.
The following safeguards are applied to Location Information (including information accessed as part of the vehicle service process):
It is only kept for as long as necessary to fulfil the service.
It is only obtained or accessed in that form where necessary to provide the service requested or where we are obliged to retain and/or provide the information by law (and where we are required to provide the information to law enforcement or any other third party, we will - notify you unless to do so would prejudice the prevention or detection of a crime or we are not permitted to do so).
Vehicle Location Information and Device Location Information are not linked unless necessary to provide the service requested.
Any other use of Location Information for analytics purposes will be undertaken on irreversibly anonymised data.
You will have been provided with a detailed description of the Location Information obtained to provide a Location Information dependent service when you initially purchased the vehicle or activated or configured the service or application (e.g. Teleservices or mobile app). You can control whether we continue to hold or collect that information through the vehicle, service or application so future Location Information ceases to be collected. Please note that we may not be able to provide certain features of our services to you if you limit the collection of your Location Information.
