HOW WE SHARE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT
Rothco may from time to time be required to share the information it collects. This may include the sharing of collected information as follows:
Trusted Third Parties
We may share your personal data with subsidiaries and affiliated companies within our corporate family, with third parties with which we have partnered to allow you to integrate their services into our own Services, and with trusted third party service providers as necessary for them to perform services on our behalf, such as processing orders, shipping products to you and processing your payment information.
We only share your personal data as necessary for any third party to provide the services as requested or as needed on our behalf. These service providers are not permitted to use your information for any secondary purpose.  We have agreements with these service providers and endeavor to ensure protection of your information by our service providers consistent with this Privacy Policy.  We do not sell, rent or share information with any outside organizations that do not have operational relationships with Rothco's for their own marketing purposes.
Business Transfers
At any time, Rothco may become involved in a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of all or a portion or all of its assets.  In such an event, personal information will likely be shared for evaluation purposes and included among the transferred assets. We may share any data contained in our databases and may transfer title to such data as part of any such transaction. Any successor in interest will remain bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy as it relates to your information.
Law Enforcement
If required by law, we may provide information we have about you to law enforcement or other government agencies, pursuant to a subpoena, bankruptcy proceedings, warrant, or other order by a court of competent jurisdiction or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.  To the extent we are legally permitted to do so, we will take reasonable steps to notify you in the event that we are required to provide your personal information as part of legal process.

If you do not wish your personal information to be disclosed to the person or organization on whose behalf you use the website, you should not use the website.
HOW WE SECURE AND RETAIN INFORMATION
Rothco endeavors to maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect the integrity and confidentiality of your personal information.  We follow generally accepted standards to store and protect collected personal information, both during transmission and once received and stored, including the utilization of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, to encrypt information you input online.  Although such technology makes it difficult for anyone to intercept or misuse information, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is perfectly secure. As a result, while we try to protect the information we hold for you, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of any information you transmit to us.
In addition, our systems are located in secure facilities and access to your data by our employees is limited to a "need to know" basis, controlled by password protected systems, and monitored for unauthorized access

We recommend that you do not divulge your user ID or password to anyone. If you share a computer with others, you should not save your log-in information on that shared computer.  Remember to sign out of your account and close your browser window when you have finished your session.
We keep personal information only for as long as necessary to provide the products you have purchased and thereafter for legitimate legal or business purposes, which includes for such periods of time as may be required by law, contract or similar obligation applicable to our business operations; or to preserve, resolve, defend or enforce any of our legal rights in contract or law; or where necessary to maintain adequate and accurate business and financial records.
OPTIONS REGARDING YOUR INFORMATION
We respect your privacy and it is always your choice whether or not to provide personal information.  However, if you choose not to provide certain information, you may not be able to register an account or utilize certain online account features.  Also, if you make a request to delete personal information, and such personal information is necessary for the products you have purchased, then such request will be honored only to the extent the personal information is no longer required for the products purchased or required for our legitimate business purposes or legal or contractual record keeping requirements.
