This Statement of Privacy applies to the HAI website and governs data collection and usage. By using the HAI website, you consent to the data practices described in this statement.
Collection of Your Personal Information
The HAI website collects personally identifiable information, such as your e-mail address, name, home or work address, or telephone number. The HAI website also collects anonymous demographic information that is not unique to you, such as your ZIP code, age, gender, preferences, interests, and favorites.
There is also information about your computer hardware and software that is automatically collected by the HAI website. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times, and referring website addresses. This information is used by the HAI website for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the HAI website.
Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose personally identifiable information or personally sensitive data through HAI website public message boards, this information may be collected and used by others. Note: the HAI website does not read any of your private online communications.
We encourage you to review the privacy statements of websites you choose to link to from the HAI website so that you can understand how those websites collect, use, and share your information. The HAI website is not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on websites outside of the HAI website and our family of websites.
Use of Your Personal Information
The HAI website collects and uses your personal information to operate the HAI website and deliver the services you have requested. The HAI website also uses your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or services available from the HAI website and its affiliates. The HAI website may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered.
The HAI website does not sell, rent, or lease its customer lists to third parties. The HAI website may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party. In addition, the HAI website may share data with trusted partners to help us perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to the HAI website, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.
The HAI website does not use or disclose sensitive personal information, such as race, religion, or political affiliations, without your explicit consent.
The HAI website keeps track of the websites and pages our customers visit within the HAI website, in order to determine what HAI website services are the most popular. This data is used to deliver customized content and advertising within the HAI website to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area.
The HAI website will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on the HAI website; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of the HAI website; and, (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the HAI website, or the public.
Use of Cookies
The HAI website uses "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a webpage server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize HAI website pages, or register with an HAI website or service, a cookie helps the HAI website to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same HAI webpage, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the HAI website features that you customized.
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the HAI website or other websites you visit.
Security of Your Personal Information
The HAI website secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. The HAI website secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
Changes to This Statement
The HAI website will occasionally update this Statement of Privacy to reflect company and customer feedback. We encourage you to periodically review this statement to be informed of how we are protecting your information.
