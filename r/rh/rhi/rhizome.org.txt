Rhizome.org: Privacy statement
In order to access certain services offered at Rhizome.org, you need to register as a member by providing some personal information, including your email address. When you register you may also choose to provide additional personal information, including biographical information, as part of your member profile. You decide whether to make your name and any other personal information available to other Rhizome.org members in our community directory. We will not disclose your personal information in the community directory unless you have authorized us to do so, and we will not disclose your personal information to others unless required to do so by law.
We may use the information that you provide to invite you to events in your local area, to update you on new developments at Rhizome.org or to send you fundraising appeals. If you don't want to receive such emails, you can opt out on the Rhizome.org web site. You may also choose to complete a voluntary demographic questionnaire. We use aggregated demographic information about our members (such as the total number of members, the countries they represent, their average income, etc.) in our marketing, publicity and fundraising materials.
You can update your information and preferences at any time on the Rhizome.org web site.

Statistical Information
Statistical information such as Web site traffic is collected and logged by our Web server. In some cases, this information is used in creative ways.
