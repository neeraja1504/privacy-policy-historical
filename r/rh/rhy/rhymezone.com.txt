Lycos Zone Privacy Vow
|
Lycos, Inc. has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this Web site: Lycos Zone
---|---
Lycos Zone was designed to provide a safe neighborhood on the Web for children 3 to 12 years old and their families. Lycos Zone is separate from the rest of the Lycos Network, where each site offers distinct features and targets a specific Web audience through unique programming. The policy on this page reflects our company's commitment to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and children's safety on the Internet. To learn more about COPPA within the other properties of the Lycos Network, please visit http://www.lycos.com/privacy/coppa.html.

Lycos Zone is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization with a mission to build trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the principles of disclosure and informed consent.

What information is being collected, and who is collecting it?
Lycos Zone does not collect any personally identifiable information. We do collect anonymous information in aggregate form as described below in the discussions about cookies and IP addresses. All of the homework, news, fun, parents and teachers zones are available for free, without you having to disclose any information about yourself.
Lycos Zone also contains links to external Web sites that have been co-branded with Lycos Zone. Registration is not required or requested on most co-branded sites. However, Lycos Zone is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such sites.
We encourage parents to participate in their child's Internet experience. Children should never give away any information about themselves without getting permission from their parents.
Some Lycos Zone co-branded sites are operated by educational nonprofit organizations that require some registration information from children with adult consent. Note: the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) does not apply to nonprofit entities. Registration is required on these sites in order to track the child's success and maintain scores and averages. Parental notification and consent are part of the registration process. Current nonprofit organizations featured on the site are:
BOOK ADVENTURE - If registering at home, a user must provide a first name and first initial of last name. If registering in the classroom, a teacher must register the children. Book Adventure's Privacy Policy states "Unless otherwise disclosed during collection, Book Adventure does not provide any personally identifying information, regardless of its source, to any third party, for any purpose whatsoever."

CYBERSURFARI - Children registering individually are not allowed to provide any registration information. A notice to parents is immediately sent so that they can register their children, with a follow up confirmation email notice. Teachers need to create teams and then register students. The only required information to enter a student is first name and T-shirt size. For more information on CyberSurfari's privacy policy, click here.
