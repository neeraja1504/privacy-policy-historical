Google Analytics is used on almost every page of our main site. The statistics gathered help us to understand how our site is used. Google Analytics uses four cookies, none of which provide us with any personal information:
__utma
Each time someone visits a page they are provided with a unique ID via the __utma cookie. This is used to log the number of unique visits to a site.

Only the first of these two cookies is used to establish a session; the other one is now redundant but is still written. This is used to indicate how long a user spends on any pages visited.
__utmz
This shows how visitors were referred to a site, e.g. via a search engine, directly, a link from another website, etc. It also shows which pages were visited once there.
