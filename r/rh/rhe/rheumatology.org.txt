Security
This website takes reasonable precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the web site, their information is protected both online and off-line.
Sensitive information such as credit card numbers are encrypted and protected with strong encryption software - SSL. Encryption means the credit card number is scrambled so that it is virtually impossible to be decoded and read by a hacker or other un-intended party. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are using an un-encrypted page.
While the College uses SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, it also takes reasonable precautions to protect user-information off-line. All users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in the College's offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our customer service representatives) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment. If users have any questions about the security please send an e-mail to
Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information

Notification of Changes
If the College decides to change the privacy policy, those changes will be posted to the homepage, and other places deemed appropriate so users are always aware of what information is collected, how it is used, and under what circumstances, if any, it is disclosed. The College will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
If, however, the College is going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection users will be notified via e-mail. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if users have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, if the College makes any material changes in the privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in the database, the Collegewill post a prominent notice on our website notifying users of the change. In some cases where a notice is posted the College will also e-mail users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in privacy practices.
