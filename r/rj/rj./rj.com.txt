Aggregated Data may be derived from your Personal Data but is not considered Personal Data in law as it cannot directly or indirectly reveal your identity.
Aggregated Data may include the time and length of your visit to this website, the pages you have visited on this website, as well as details of the website you visited immediately prior to visiting this website. We may also record the name of your internet service provider. We use this information only to measure site activity and to develop ideas for improving our services.

However, if we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your Personal Data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as Personal Data which will be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Special Categories of Personal Data
It is a necessary part of our business to collect certain types of Special Categories of Personal Data about you. For example, we need to collect data about your state of health if you inform us about that you are pregnant, have a medical condition which requires special equipment, or when you make a request for mobility assistance. Making certain meal choices will also involve the collection of data about your religious beliefs or state of health, for example if you inform us that you require a Halal or diabetic meal.
We treat our obligations to protect Special Categories of Personal Data very seriously and we will always ask your express consent to collect, process or transfer such data for specified purposes each time you provide it to us.
Personal Data relating to minor passengers
In certain circumstances, we may need to collect, process or transfer Personal Data relating to minor passengers (i.e. children under the age of 16), for example where a flight booking is made in respect of a minor passenger. This is necessary for us to pursue our legitimate interests in running our business and to perform the contract of carriage.
We will only use Personal Data relating to minor passengers for the specified purposes set out in section 6 and with the express consent of the person who has parental responsibility. Minor passengers have the same rights as any other passenger regarding their Personal Data which are set out in section 12.
Providing Personal Data on behalf of other passengers
By providing us with Personal Data, including Special Categories of Personal Data, relating to other passengers on your booking, you are representing that you have their authority to provide their Personal Data to us and to consent to their Personal Data being collected and processed for the specified purposes. Royal Jordanian is entitled to rely upon such representations.
If you fail to provide Personal Data
Where we need to collect Personal Data by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you. In these circumstances, we have the right to cancel or refuse to accept your booking, but we will notify you if this is the case at the time.

6-HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL DATA
We will only use your Personal Data as permitted by law. Most commonly, we will rely on the following types of lawful basis to process your Personal Data:
* **Legitimate Interests** : the interests of Royal Jordanian in conducting and managing our business in order to give you the highest standard of service and the best and most secure travel experience. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your Personal Data for our legitimate interests.
We do not use your Personal Data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your express consent or are otherwise required or permitted to do so by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting us.
* **Performance of Contract** : processing your Personal Data is necessary for the performance of the contract of carriage to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.
* **Comply with a legal or regulatory obligation** : processing your Personal Data may be necessary for compliance with a legal or regulatory obligation to which we are subject.
For example, in accordance with Article L 232-6 of French Internal Security Code, we may transmit reservation, checking or boarding data collected from passengers (API/PNR) to the French national public services and competent authorities for the purposes and under conditions as defined in the Decret N° 2014-1095 dated 26 September 2014.
* **Consent:** in certain circumstances, we may ask for your express consent to collect, process or transfer your Personal Data, for example in relation to opting in to receiving our newsletter or other direct marketing. You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time simply by contacting us.

This means that, when you visit this website in future, we can tailor information to suit your individual preferences which can save you time and provide you with a more personalised visit.
You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access cookies. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this website may become inaccessible or not function properly. For more information about the cookies we use, please see our Cookie Policy Read More..
Change of purpose
We will only use your Personal Data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us.
If we need to use your Personal Data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you to explain the legal basis which allows us to do so or, where required by law, to seek your consent.
7- MARKETING
We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain Personal Data uses, particularly around marketing and advertising.
Promotional offers from us
We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which services and offers may be relevant for you (we call this “marketing”).
The “soft opt-in”
You will continue to receive marketing communications from us if you have previously booked flights or purchased other services from in the past, or if you have requested information from us in connection with a potential booking or purchase, unless you have opted out of receiving future marketing communications.
Third-party marketing
We will request your express consent before we share your Personal Data with any company outside the Group for marketing purposes.
Opting out
You can ask us to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by following the opt-out links on any marketing message sent to you or by contacting us at any time.
Please note that we may process your Personal Data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.
8-DISCLOSURES OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA
We may have to share your Personal Data for the purposes set out in the table in section 6 with the following parties:
Disclosure of your Personal Data within the Group
Companies in the Group, outstations, branches and offices acting as joint controllers or processors of your Personal Data.
Disclosure of your Personal Data to External Third Parties
* Service providers acting as processors who provide IT and system administration services to Royal Jordanian.
*  Service providers and suppliers acting as processors who provide passengers services, such as ground-handling companies, catering providers, and companies providing assistance for passengers with reduced mobility.
* Professional advisers acting as processors or joint controllers including lawyers, bankers, consultants, auditors and insurers who provide consultancy, banking, legal, insurance and accounting services.
* Regulators and other authorities acting as processors or joint controllers who require reporting of processing activities in certain circumstances.
* Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your Personal Data in the same way as set out in this Privacy Policy.
We require all third parties to respect the security of your Personal Data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your Personal Data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your Personal Data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.
*   * **9-INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS**
Internal Transfers
We will share your Personal Data within the Group. As Royal Jordanian’s head office is based in Amman, Jordan, it will be necessary to transfer Personal Data which was collected in the European Economic Area ( EEA ) outside of the EEA.
We ensure your Personal Data is protected by requiring all of our Group companies, branches, offices and outstations to follow the same rules when processing your Personal Data. These rules are called "Binding Corporate Rules". A copy of Royal Jordanian’s Binding Corporate Rules can be found here. Learn More
External Transfers
Many of our external third parties are based outside the EEA so their processing of your Personal Data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.
Whenever we transfer your Personal Data to third parties which are based outside the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to the data by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
* Certain non-EEA countries to which we will transfer your Personal Data have already been deemed by the European Commission to provide an adequate level of protection. For further details, see [European Commission: Adequacy of the protection of Personal Data in non-EU countries](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en).
* Where we use third party service providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are covered by the EU-US Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to Personal Data shared between the Europe and the US. For further details, see [European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield](https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/justice-and-fundamental-rights/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/eu-us-privacy-shield_en).
* Where we use certain third party service providers which are not based in the EEA or the US, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give your Personal Data the same protection it has in Europe.
Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your Personal Data out of the EEA.
10-DATA SECURITY
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your Personal Data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your Personal Data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your Personal Data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected Personal Data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
11-  DATA RETENTION
How long we retain your Personal Data
We will only retain your Personal Data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which we collected it, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. In order to comply with the laws of The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, we retain all documents and data for up to 15 years.
In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see Request erasure in section 12 below for further information. In some circumstances we may anonymise your Personal Data (so that it can no longer be associated with you and you can no longer be identified by it) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
12- YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS
Under certain circumstances, you have the following rights under data protection laws in relation to your Personal Data:
* **Request access** to your Personal Data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the Personal Data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
* **Request correction** of the Personal Data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
* **Request erasure** of your Personal Data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove Personal Data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your Personal Data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your Personal Data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
* **Object to processing** of your Personal Data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes (and you will always be able to opt-out via the “unsubscribe” link on an email from us). In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
* **Request restriction of processing** of your Personal Data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your Personal Data in the following situations: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it because you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
* **Request the transfer** of your Personal Data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your Personal Data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to information which was originally collected electronically and which you either consented to us using or was used to perform a contract with you.
* **Withdraw consent at any time** where we are relying on consent to process your Personal Data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us .
No fee usually required
You will not have to pay a fee to access your Personal Data or to exercise any of the other rights. However, we may charge a reasonable fee (taking into account the administrative costs of providing the information) if we consider your request to be unfounded, repetitive or excessive.  Alternatively, in these circumstances, we may refuse to comply with your request but we will provide you with a full explanation of this at the time.
What we may need from you
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that Personal Data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
Time limit to respond
We will respond to all legitimate requests within one calendar month. If your request is particularly complex, or you have made a number of requests, it may take us longer up to three calendar months to respond, but we will notify you of this and keep you updated.

For example, we need to collect data about your state of health if you inform us about that you are pregnant, have a medical condition which requires special equipment, or when you make a request for mobility assistance. Making certain meal choices will also involve the collection of data about your religious beliefs or state of health, for example if you inform us that you require a Halal or diabetic meal.

In certain circumstances, we may need to collect, process or transfer Personal Data relating to minor passengers (i.e. children under the age of 16), for example where a flight booking is made in respect of a minor passenger. This is necessary for us to pursue our legitimate interests in running our business and to perform the contract of carriage.

Minor passengers have the same rights as any other passenger regarding their Personal Data which are set out in section 12.
Providing Personal Data on behalf of other passengers
By providing us with Personal Data, including Special Categories of Personal Data, relating to other passengers on your booking, you are representing that you have their authority to provide their Personal Data to us and to consent to their Personal Data being collected and processed for the specified purposes. Royal Jordanian is entitled to rely upon such representations.
If you fail to provide Personal Data
Where we need to collect Personal Data by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you. In these circumstances, we have the right to cancel or refuse to accept your booking, but we will notify you if this is the case at the time.
