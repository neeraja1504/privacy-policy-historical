(“ReachLocal”, “we”, “us”) is committed to respecting your privacy and recognizes your need for appropriate protection and management of any personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) you share with us. ReachLocal has established this Privacy Policy to let you know what information we may collect from you on the publicly available portion of Reachlocal.com (the “Site”) and through various other interactions with you, and how we may use and share that information. Please take a moment to review the terms of our Privacy Policy. By using the Site and/or providing us Personal Information, you agree to accept the terms of our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site or provide us any Personal Information. This Privacy Policy applies to information that we collect on the Site and to information which we may collect by other “offline” means, including, without limitation, sales calls and other business transactions. A description of the information we collect on behalf of our advertiser clients through our advertising services is set out in our Notice of Marketing Practices.
Personal Information
Information We May Collect
Personal Information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, a home, business, or other physical address, a phone number, and an email address. We collect Personal Information from our Site users and customers only when such information is voluntarily provided to us, including, without limitation, in connection with inquiries about our services through the “Contact Us” page, as part of signing up for our email subscriptions, or in the process of your business transactions with us. To make our content more relevant to you, we may also ask for information about your present place of employment, such as company name, size, industry sector and number of employees. Of course, if you send us an email in connection with an inquiry about a job listed on the “Careers” page, we may also store the Personal Information provided in connection with that inquiry.
We also offer a variety of email subscriptions where you can get information about online marketing and promotions and special offers. You can subscribe for such emails and you can manage your email preferences . If you become a customer of ReachLocal, we will always retain the right to email you regarding the Site or services that we’re providing to you.
How We May Use Your Information
If you provide us with Personal Information, we may retain and use that information for several purposes, including facilitating and otherwise addressing your inquiry, request, subscriptions, or business transactions and relationship with ReachLocal. For example, we may use your Personal Information in order to respond to your questions or requests for information about ReachLocal. We may also use Personal Information to ensure compliance with our policies and applicable law.
With Whom We May Share Your Information
We may sometimes use other businesses to perform certain services for us, such as maintaining the Site and our e-mail services and processing inquiries. We may provide Personal Information to those businesses when that information is necessary for them to complete a requested transaction or otherwise perform their duties. ReachLocal will take reasonable steps to ensure that these third-party service providers are obligated to protect Personal Information on ReachLocal’s behalf. ReachLocal will not sell or share your Personal Information with any unaffiliated third parties for marketing purposes. In the event that ReachLocal or all of its assets are acquired, all of the data collected by ReachLocal through the Site and through other means and services provided by ReachLocal would be among the transferred assets. We reserve the right to disclose such information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property, other visitors, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. We also reserve the right to disclose such information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.
Non-Personal Information
From time to time, we may collect general, non-personal, statistical information about the use of the Site, such as from what sites visitors are coming from when they visit our Site, when they first visited our Site, their IP address, how many visitors visit a specific page on the Site, how long they stay on that page and which hyperlinks, if any, they “click” on. We may use the IP address to infer information about such visitor, including its company, city and state. We collect this information through the use of “cookies” and other tracking technologies, which are discussed in greater detail below. We collect this information in order to determine which areas of the Site are most popular and to enhance the Site for visitors. We may group this information into aggregate visitor data in order to describe the use of the Site to our existing or potential business partners, sponsors, advertisers, or other third parties, or in response to a government request.
