Non-personally identifiable information is information that cannot be tracked to a specific individual. RTTNews may collect non-personally identifiable information while you are visiting the RTTNews Website or the Website of one of RTTNews advertisers. With each advertising impression served, RTTNews collects information such as the time of day, URL visited, browser type, browser language, and IP address.

RTTNews may place advertisements of third-party advertisers on its Websites.  If you choose to click on an advertisement, RTTNews may provide non-personally identifiable information to the advertiser.
The advertisers may use the information collected from you to serve Interest-based advertising (IBA) which allow them to deliver targeted advertising. IBA usually works by displaying advertisements that are based on the type of content you access or read. You can make use of Network Advertising Initiative's (NAI) Opt Out Tool (http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#!/) to restrain yourself from receiving IBA. When you select this option, no information from you will be utilized for IBA and there will not be any customization relevant to you. However, it does not mean that you will never receive any advertisement from us for the period in which you are using our services.

We retain personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill any legal obligations we may have as well as for purposes of processing your information (for example, if you continue to subscribe to one of our services, we will need your information to deliver the service to you).  We may also retain aggregate information beyond this time for research purposes and to help us develop and improve our services. You cannot be identified from aggregate information retained or used for these purposes.
Information We May Disclose
We share demographic, profile and other general information about you and our other customers with our advertisers on an aggregate basis. This means that we tell our advertisers general information about the characteristics of our customer base (e.g. geographical).

From time to time we may use third parties (pursuant to a confidentiality agreement) to assist us in e-mail broadcasts and list management.
