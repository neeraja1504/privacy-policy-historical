RTPersonals - RTPersonals PRIVACY POLICY
RTPersonals.com's Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy (the "Policy") applies to RTPersonals.com
We understand that the privacy of its members, subscribers, guests and/or visitors (collectively, "Members", "you" or "your") is very important. We developed this Policy to ensure that your privacy is protected while using RTPersonals.com.
A Special Note About Children.
Children under eighteen years of age are prohibited from using RTPersonals.com. We ask that children not submit information to us.
How We Collect, Use and Disclose Information
What Information Do We Collect?
During the registration process for, or while using, RTPersonals.com, you may choose to provide us with certain "Personal Information" including:
* your name and email address,
* billing information,
* "Sensitive Personal Information", which includes your racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
When we refer to "Personal Information" in this Policy, unless we say otherwise, this includes "Sensitive Personal Information."
We may also collect information about your activities or postings on RTPersonals.com when you choose to send us personal correspondence such as emails or letters or when other RTPersonals.com users or third parties send us correspondence, which may include their comments about you. All this information will be kept in a file that is accessed only by our authorized personnel or representatives.
On RTPersonals.com you may choose to use our referral service to tell a friend or friends about us. In this case, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address and email your friend an invite to him or her to visit RTPersonals.com.
Providing your Personal Information to us is voluntary. However, if you do not provide your Personal Information to us, you will not be able to access some or all of our services.
How do We Use Your Information?
When you provide Personal Information to us, we will use it to contact you about our services, to process payment for our services, and to tailor our services to your meet your preferences.
We use your Personal Information for many specific purposes, including:
* emailing you with news and updates about RTPersonals.com
* improving and customizing our content and product offerings
* analyzing RTPersonals.com usage and delivering information (such as banners and promotions) targeted to your interests
* providing you with information about the products and services provided by RTPersonals.coms or third parties
If you have provided us with certain Personal Information, we will also use it to facilitate your communication with other members, for example, by the use of the message center or delivery of "Cupid Reports" or "Ice Breakers".
We may also use your Personal Information to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, enforce any agreements, policies and rules governing the use of RTPersonals.com, and observe RTPersonals.com for quality control and customer service purposes.
If you use our referral services, we will use your friend's name and email address only to send an invitation and to track the status of the referral. Your friend(s) may use the unsubscribe function in the email or contact us at help@rtpersonals.com to request that we remove their email address from our records.
When and to Whom Will We Disclose Your Information?
Due to the nature of many of the services provided by RTPersonals.com, certain of your Personal Information will be disclosed to other Members or related websites affiliated with RTPersonals.com. As an example, if you complete a "dating" profile and choose to disclose your religious affiliation or ethnic origin, this information will be available to other Members using the services on RTPersonals.com. By providing this type of profile information to us, you have consented to the use and disclosure of your Personal Information in this manner.
We may share or transfer your Personal Information with websites affiliated with RTPersonals.com so that they can send you information about their products or services that you may be interested in.
We also disclose Personal Information to our service providers (for example, credit card processing companies, billing services) as reasonably necessary or appropriate to provide services on RTPersonals.com. Our service providers are legally required by us to protect your Personal Information. Because RTPersonals.com operates or uses service providers located in different countries, your Personal Information may be transferred to a country in which you do not reside, and while in that foreign country, may be accessible to its law enforcement authorities.
We may be required to disclose your Personal Information in order to comply with a court order, subpoena, search warrant, or as otherwise compelled by law. In addition, we expressly reserve the right to disclose your Personal Information when we have a good faith belief that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, to enforce our agreements, policies, and rules governing your use of RTPersonals.com, to cooperate with law enforcement, and/or to report information concerning a threat of serious injury or death.
We DO NOT sell or rent any of your Personal Information to third parties for marketing purposes without your express permission or consent. We may, however, disclose to third-party advertisers certain aggregated or hashed (i.e., encrypted) information in a manner that no longer reflects or references an individually identifiable user, for other marketing and promotional purposes.
When you provide your Personal Information and Sensitive Personal Information to us, you consent to our use and disclosure of that information as described in this Policy. If you do not want us to use or disclose your Personal Information as described in this Policy, do not provide it to us. We note that this may result in you being unable to access some or all of our services.

We use Pixel Tags to track your use of RTPersonals.com, for advertising, marketing, or promotional purposes, and to determine whether you opened an email message from us. The information also enables us to customize the services we offer.
Other parties may collect Personal Information about your online activities over time and across different websites when you use the Services. We honor web browser "do not track" signals that provide you with the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of Personal Information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services, when the web browser's http header includes the field "dnt:1". We do not presently honor any other types of "Do Not Track" mechanism.
Collection, Use and Disclosure of Personal Information by Third Parties
This Policy only addresses the use and disclosure of Personal Information that we collect from you.

We use industry standard efforts, such as firewalls, to safeguard your Personal Information.

The data protection and other laws of the United States and these other countries might not be as comprehensive as those in your country, and your Personal Information may be accessible to law enforcement authorities in the United States or of other countries. When you use RTPersonals.com, you consent to us transferring your Personal Information (which includes, for the avoidance of doubt, your Sensitive Personal Information) from your country to the United States or countries in which we or our service providers are located for the purposes described in this Policy.
