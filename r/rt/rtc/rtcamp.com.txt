This page specifies the data that we collect, how we collect it and why we collect it. If you have any additional queries, or if we have failed to provide you with any information, you can contact us via our Contact Page and we will get back to you within two working days.
The overarching principles of our policy are as follows:
We don’t ask you for personal information unless we have to
We don’t share your personal information with anyone outside of rtCamp unless explicitly specified in this document
We don’t store any of your personal information unless we need it for testing, development or to make our services better. Even in this case, we make sure to irreversibly delete it as soon as it has served its purpose
This has been our policy before GDPR, and will be our policy going forward, regardless of regulation.
