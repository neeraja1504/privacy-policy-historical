The USA Patriot Act Disclosure
USA Patriot Act/Identity Theft - Customer Identification Program
Enacted to help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities. Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each person who applied for a loan. When you apply for a loan, we will ask your name, address, date of birth and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see your driver's license or other identifying documents.
The Right to Receive Appraisal Disclosure
If your credit is to be secured by a first lien on a dwelling, we may order an appraisal to determine the property's value and charge you for this appraisal. We will promptly give you a copy of any appraisal, even if your loan does not close. You can pay for an additional appraisal for your own use at your own cost.
