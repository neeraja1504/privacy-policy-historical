See below for privacy contact information. In such cases, we ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests because of the reasons stated above or because such requests are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, relate to information that is incorporated into other databases or Services as permitted by this Privacy Policy, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes or derivative information that is not separable), or for other reasons.
