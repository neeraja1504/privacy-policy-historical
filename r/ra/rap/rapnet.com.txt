Should you be expelled or excluded as a member/customer, your name and member details may be posted online. However, your credit card number will NEVER be revealed to anyone other than 3rd party PCI compliant payment processors, except with your express written permission or if we are required to do so pursuant to a subpoena or other legal process. We process this information given our legitimate interest in providing the Services.

We disclose information we collect in response to a law enforcement request, subpoena, warrant, court order, levy, attachment, order of a court-appointed receiver or other comparable legal process, including subpoenas from private parties in a civil action.
We disclose information we collect in circumstances in which Rapaport believes the Services are being used in the commission of a crime; when we have a good faith belief that there is an emergency that poses a threat to the safety or security of you or another person; or when necessary either to protect the rights or property of Rapaport, the Services or our subsidiaries, or affiliates in the Rapaport Group, or for us to render the Services provided. We disclose information we collect to your agent or legal representative (such as the holder of a power of attorney that you grant, or a guardian appointed for you).
Where permissible according to applicable law, we may use certain limited personal information about you, such as your email address, to hash it and to share it with social media or advertising platforms, such as Facebook or Google, to generate leads, drive traffic to our websites or otherwise promote our Services. These processing activities are based on our legitimate interest in undertaking marketing activities to offer you and others products or services that may be in your or their interest.
The social media platforms with which we may share your personal data are not controlled or supervised by Rapaport and they are considered data processors.

We share aggregated statistical data with our business partners or for public relations. For example, we may disclose that a specific percentage of our clients have addresses in New York. However, this aggregated information is not tied to personally identifiable information. We share your information with our parent, subsidiaries, affiliates and joint ventures to help coordinate the Services we provide to you, enforce our terms and conditions, and promote trust and safety.
We share your information with third party companies that perform services on our behalf, including payment and subscription processing, order fulfillment, data analysis, marketing services, e-mail campaigns, hosting services, and customer service.

We may also share your information with third party companies that we partner with to provide certain services to you in connection with the Services. We only share the minimum data needed for Data Processors to perform the services for which they are contracted.

Where applicable, in order to facilitate the transactions between Rapaport clients, our Services may allow you limited access to other clients' contact or shipping information.

In all cases, you must provide clients with the opportunity to remove themselves from your database and review any information you have collected about them. In addition, under no circumstances, except as defined in this Section, can you disclose personally identifiable information about another Rapaport client to any third party without our consent and the consent of such other client after adequate disclosure.
