Privacy Policy
The TowerData Privacy Policy is our way of ensuring the safety and accuracy of Internet users' personal information, whether gathered on this site, by our clients, or by our partners.
We are in the data technology business and understand the importance of personal information security. We only work with companies that protect the personal information they collect from their existing or potential customers.  We respect your privacy and are committed to safeguarding it.  This “Privacy Policy” discloses how we gather and use personal information and our compliance with EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework.
How We Gather Information
TowerData’s email data technology helps businesses improve their ability to communicate with and understand who their customers are.
When you visit our website, www.towerdata.com, we collect the information you voluntarily give us when you register on our site or complete a “contact us” form. Additionally, like most websites, our servers use log files to list requests made by users to the server.  We use log files to store information such as internet protocol addresses, browser type, internet service provider, visited pages, date and time used and we also gather broad demographic information.
We also receive data through aggregation of personal information received from websites and compilers of websites (data providers) where people have opted-in to receive third party offers through websites or email. The data we receive is maintained in our database and may be shared with clients who use our data enhancement services and with our marketing partners. We mandate that any company that provides us with data for enhancement services certify that the data represents permissible data that they are allowed to share with us and that we are allowed to use. If we become aware that the data is not in compliance, we will terminate our relationship with that company immediately and destroy that data.
Processor on Behalf
TowerData provides data processing services designed to enable organizations to improve the quality of their customer information. In this capacity, all of the information processed by TowerData is owned and controlled by TowerData's clients. TowerData receives information transferred from the EU and Switzerland to the United States strictly as a processor on behalf of our clients. As a processor on behalf, TowerData acts only on the instructions of its clients and does not control or share such data without direction from the client. For such processing, TowerData enters into appropriate agreements with its clients specifying that the client recognizes that it is a data controller for the purpose of the EU Data Protection Directive and is in compliance with the applicable EU Member State data protection laws or the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection.
The Use of Cookies

TowerData and our partners send and read cookies when you visit our sites or open our emails, and they are used to track individual responses or views of advertisements or websites. This information may be used to help predict what advertisements may be of interest to consumers and enable the receipt of customized advertisements or content. This may result, for example, in ads for TowerData appearing on websites that you visit. These cookies contain no personally identifiable information.

You can express your choices for display advertising, through the following platforms: Digital Advertising Alliance opt-out platform or the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out platform.
We and/or our partners may also use cookie's for creating personalized advertising emails. These cookies are used to identify the visitors of our advertisers' websites and send personalized emails based on the visitors' browsing experience. For example, if you browse on of our advertisers' websites, you may receive a personalized email promoting the advertiser or the product you were viewing. You will only receive such personalized email if you have consented to receive email from one of our partners (an advertiser, a publisher or an email list provider).

The Use of Web Beacons
A "web beacon" is programming code used to display an image on a web page and can also transfer an individual’s user identification to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired information about the individual. Web beacons enable TowerData to track certain Web sites you visit or emails or advertisements you view online. Web beacons help determine products or services in which you may be interested and help track online behaviors for marketing purposes.
