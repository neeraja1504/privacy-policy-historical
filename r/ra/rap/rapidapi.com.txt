Such change will be effective ten (10) days following posting of the revised Privacy Policy on the Site, and your continued use of the Services thereafter means that you accept those changes.
4. What Personal Information We Collect and How We Collect It. We do not currently require you to provide Personal Information in order to have access to general information available on the Site. But, we do receive and/or collect Personal Information from you in the following ways:
4.1. Account. In order to use certain services that we offer via the Site and/or Application, you may be required to create an account (“Account”). We may offer different options to create an Account, including:

You will be asked to provide us with certain mandatory information such as your name, email address, and also a password that you will use for your Account. You may also optionally provide a mobile number for 2-step verification.
(b) Third Party Accounts: You may choose to create an Account by clicking on a ‘connect’ or ‘sign-in’ button that we may display on the Site or Application for a designated third party website or service (each a “Third Party Account”) such as Facebook. Doing so will enable you to link your Service Account and your Third Party Account. If you choose this option, then you will be required to approve the connection as well as the types of information (which may include Personal Information such as, at minimum, your email, full name, and Facebook ID) that we will obtain from your Third Party Account and the types of activities that we may perform in connection with your Third Party Account. Please note that in order to use this option, you will need to have, and may need to be signed-in to, an existing Third Party Account.
Regardless of which method you choose to register your Account, we may send an email to your nominated email address to instruct you how to confirm your registration.
4.3. Share with Friends Service. The Site and/or Application may enable you to invite your friends to use our Services by sending them an invitation email or message. You may do so by: (i) using the Site and/or Application to send or post an invitation message via your Third Party Account; and/or (ii) using the Site and/or Application to send an invitation email to your friend’s external email address (for example, a gmail address).

4.7. Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies. Our Services may utilize “cookies”, anonymous identifiers and other tracking technologies in order to for us to provide our Services and present you with information that is customized for you. A “cookie” is a small text file that may be used, for example, to collect information about activity on the Services.

Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit the Service, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to the Service.

In order to provide the Services to you, your Public Profile and any content that you post on or via the Services, such as the Customer Content and User Submissions, will be collected and used by us or by other third-party service-providers in accordance with the Terms. By uploading your Customer Content and User Submissions, you confirm that your Customer Content and User Submissions may be publicly available to other users of the Services, and may also be accessed and used by people off the Services, such as the users of any site or app you create using the Services. You control, and are solely responsible for, the extent of public access to your Customer Content through the design of any software that you create using the Services. We, therefore, strongly encourage you to adopt your own privacy policy with your own users and to only post information in your Customer Content in accordance with that privacy policy.

We may use Anonymous Information (as defined below) or disclose it to third party service providers in order to improve our Services and enhance your experience with the Services. We may also disclose Anonymous Information (with or without compensation) to third parties, including advertisers and partners. “Anonymous Information” means information which does not enable identification of an individual user, such as aggregated information about you or your users’ use of our Services. You agree to inform your users of this data collection practice in your own privacy policy.
8. Opting In/Out. You may choose to receive future promotional, advertising, or other Services-related emails from us at the time you create your account. If you wish to opt-out of such emails in the future, you may do so at any time by selecting an unsubscribe link at the bottom of each email that we send. Please note that even if you opt out of receiving the foregoing emails, we may still send you a response to any “Contact Us” request as well as administrative emails (for example, in connection with a password reset request) that are necessary to facilitate your use of the Services.
9. Choice. At all times, you may choose whether or not to provide or disclose Personal Information. If you choose not to provide mandatory Personal Information, you may still visit parts of the Services but you may be unable to access certain options, programs, offers, and services that involve our interaction with you.
10. Access/Accuracy. To the extent that you do provide us with Personal Information, we wish to maintain accurate Personal Information.

Your email should include adequate details of your request.
11. Links to and Interaction with Third Party Products. The Services may enable you to interact with or contain links to your Third Party Account and other third party websites, mobile software applications and services that are not owned or controlled by us (each a “Third Party Service”). We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Third Party Services. Please be aware that the Third Party Services may collect Personal Information from you. Accordingly, we encourage you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each Third Party Service that you choose to use or interact with.
12. Children’s Privacy. The Services are not structured to attract children under the age of 13 years. Accordingly, we do not intend to collect Personal Information from anyone we know to be under 13 years. If we learn that we have collected Personal Information from a child under 13 years, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any such information, please contact us at privacy@rapidapi.com.

To make such a request, please send an email to privacy@rapidapi.com. Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each year.
16. Our California Do Not Track Notice.
We do not currently respond or take any action with respect to web browser “do not track” signals or other mechanisms that provide consumers the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personally identifiable information about an individual consumer’s online activities over time and across third-party web sites or online services. We may allow third parties, such as companies that provide us with analytics tools, to collect personally identifiable information about an individual consumer’s online activities over time and across different web sites when a consumer uses the Services.
17. Deletion of Content from California Residents. If you are a California resident under the age of 18 and a registered user, California Business and Professions Code Section 22581 permits you to remove content or Personal Information you have publicly posted. If you wish to remove such content or Personal Information and you specify which content or Personal Information you wish to be removed, we will do so in accordance with applicable law. Please be aware that after removal you will not be able to restore removed content. In addition, such removal does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or Personal Information you have posted and that there may be circumstances in which the law does not require us to enable removal of content.
18. Commitment. We are committed to protecting your privacy. Protecting your privacy online is an evolving area, and we are constantly evolving our Service to meet these demands.
