Rapid7 Privacy Policy
Last Updated: May 25, 2018
Our quest to accelerate insight for security and technology practitioners requires collecting and processing a significant amount of data. Ensuring your data is used only in a manner consistent with your expectations is a responsibility we take very seriously, and we back the privacy statements below with layers of security to safeguard your data.
Rapid7, we, and us refers to Rapid7, Inc., Rapid7 LLC and any of our corporate affiliates.
This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use and disclose information you provide to us, including personal information, by which we mean information that would allow us to determine your identity when you engage with us. For example, we may receive your information when you use our solutions or services or otherwise interact with us (for example, by using our websites or attending our events). In addition, this Privacy Policy covers the information we may collect through our research initiatives.
This Privacy Policy also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information. We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy carefully when using or providing information to us through our sites, solutions, and services. You understand that by using our sites, solutions, and services, you are accepting our practices as described in this Privacy Policy.
What kinds of information do we collect?
Information you provide directly to us
For example, we collect information you provide in order to access our solutions, use our sites, subscribe to our content, or register for an activity associated with Rapid7. This may include, but is not limited to, your name, email address, telephone number, and mailing address.
If you make a purchase from Rapid7, become one of our vendors, or otherwise establish a relationship with us that involves financial transactions, we collect information about those transactions. This may include, but is not limited to, your credit or debit card information, account and authentication information, tax identifiers, and other billing, delivery, and contact details.
Information we collect to deliver and improve our solutions and services
In order to provide our solutions and services to you, we must necessarily collect certain information automatically. This also helps us to ensure that our solutions and services are operating correctly. The types of information we collect include:
Device and network data
User and system behavior
Application logs
Organizational information
Other relevant machine data
We also collect information about the solutions you use and how you use them, such as how often you access our products and which features you use most frequently. This is done in an effort to improve your experience with our solutions. For example, we may use this information to reach out to you if you seem “stuck” on a certain process within the solution, to make our solutions more intuitive, or to enhance the solution’s most popular features.
On our sites, Rapid7 and our third-party partners collect information using cookies and other tracking technologies. Please see our full Cookie Notice, which includes information on how to control or opt out of these cookies and tracking technologies.
Information from third-parties
We receive various types of information from third-parties on some occasions, such as when we jointly offer services or sponsor events. We also collect data from third party security providers and online databases in connection with our research activities that relate to active or historic threats, vulnerabilities, and risks around the world. This can include data like domain names, IP addresses, email accounts, and usernames that are associated with security risks (for example, known compromised accounts and usernames), and we use this information to enhance the security services we provide to you.

How do we use this information?
To deliver, improve, and develop our offerings
We are able to deliver our solutions and services, understand the behavior of attackers, and better help our customers keep their environments safe by using the information we collect above.
In general, we only process our customers' information to deliver our offerings on their behalf. Although we may collect the information listed above, we do not access information that we process on our customer’s behalf, such as user, network, vulnerability, incident, or asset information, unless our customers have requested we do so to investigate issues with our solution or carry out a service.
To communicate with you
We use your information to communicate with you about our solutions, services, features, surveys, newsletters, offers, promotions, and events, and to provide other news or information about Rapid7 and our partners, in accordance with your communications preferences.
We will also use your information to respond to you when you contact us.
To conduct research initiatives
The vast majority of the data we collect through our research initiatives is data that’s publicly available. It is collected to educate and enrich the security community, and foster secure adoption of technology. For example, one of our research initiatives uses the metadata from publicly expose services to identify large-scale misconfigurations and vulnerabilities in consumer, enterprise, and critical infrastructure systems.

How is this information shared?
With organizations participating in or promoting research
Information related to the research we conduct may be shared with various research and security organizations, including academic institutions or publications, but only when this information is already freely publicly available and/or non-identifiable.

With third-party vendors, consultants, service providers, or other business partners
Some third parties provide services on our behalf and may require access to your information to carry out that work, including billing, customer support, etc. These service providers are authorized to use your information only as necessary to provide the services in scope and are subject to strict contractual controls to protect the confidentiality and security of your information. If you’re a customer of our products or services, our list of subprocessors is available here.
In the case of a merger, sale, financing, or acquisition
We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company. You will subsequently be notified via email and/or via a prominent notice on our sites of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.  The recipient of your information will be informed of the need to protect your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

How do we respond to legal requests?

How secure is my data?
We're a security company, so naturally we take data security very seriously. We use appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect your data against any accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, the information we process.

How long do you keep data for?
If you are a customer, we will retain your information for as long as your account is active, or as needed to provide you products and/or services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide our offerings, contact us at privacy@rapid7.com.
In all other cases, we will retain and use your information as necessary for legitimate business reasons, including as needed to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, and to enforce our agreements.  When we have no ongoing legitimate business reason to process your information, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

I'm from the Europe – is there anything else I should know?
Legal basis for processing personal information
If you are an individual in the European Economic Area, our legal basis for collecting and using your information will depend on the information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.
However, we will normally collect information from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the information to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. Where we collect and use your information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), it will normally be obvious from the context what those legitimate interests are.
If we are processing information about you on behalf of a customer in the course of providing our services to them (i.e. as a data processor), then it is our customer's responsibility to determine the legal basis for the processing we conduct on their behalf. If you ask us about information we are processing on behalf of a customer, we will direct you to speak with the relevant customer.
If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your information, please contact us using the contact details provided below.
Additional data protection rights
In addition to your rights to access, correct, update and delete your information described above, and your right to opt-out of communications also explained above, you also have the right to object to processing of your information, ask us to restrict processing of your information or to request portability of your information. You can exercise these rights by contacting us using the contact details provided below.
If we have collected and process your information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
If you are unhappy with the way we have processed your information, you have the right to complain to a data protection authority. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority. (Contact details for data protection authorities in the European Economic Area are available here.)
We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
