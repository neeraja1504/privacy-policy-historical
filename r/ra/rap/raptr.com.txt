Privacy Policy â€¢ Raptr
Welcome to the raptr.com website run by Raptr, Inc. ( "Raptr," "we," "us," or "our" ). Raptr is committed to respecting the privacy rights and concerns of all users of our raptr.com website (the "Site" ) (we refer to the Site and the services we provide as described in our Site collectively as the "Raptr Features" ). As such, we have established and implemented this privacy statement to inform visitors to the Site and users of the Raptr Features how we use and protect the information we collect. If you have any questions regarding this information or our privacy practices, please see the section entitled "Questions? Contact Us" at the end of this privacy statement. This privacy statement is effective as of 2/22/08.
What information does Raptr collect?
Raptr does not collect personally identifiable information unless our visitors voluntarily provide it to us. We do, however, collect certain types of information and ask for personal information in certain circumstances, such as when you set up an account. The following sections describe what type of information we collect, when we collect it and how we use it.
Setting up an account
In order to use certain functionality of the Raptr Features, you will have to create a user account which requires you to submit certain personal information. When you register and create an account, we require you to provide us your name and email address as well as a user name that you select. We also ask for certain information about yourself such as your age, birthdate, gender and interests. Upon activating an account, you will select a user name and password. Your user name and password will be used so you can securely access and maintain your account.
Viewing Web Pages
As with most web sites, your computer sends information that gets logged by a web server when you browse our Site. This typically includes your computer's IP address, operating system, browser name/version, the referring web page, requested page, date/time, and sometimes a "cookie" (which can be disabled using your browser preferences) to help the site remember your last visit. If you are logged in, this information is associated with your personal account. The information is also included in anonymous statistics to allow us to understand how visitors use our site.
Cookies
We may from time to time implement "cookies" or other features to allow us or third parties to collect or share information that will help us improve our Site and the Raptr Features we offer, or help us offer new services and features. A cookie is a small amount of data, that often includes an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to a user's browser from a Web server and stored on a user's computer hard drive. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personal information about you. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser, however please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of our Site or the Raptr Features
Viewing and Downloading Content and Advertising
As with browsing web pages, when you watch content and advertising or download games and other software on our Site or through the Raptr Features, most of the same information is sent to us (including, IP Address, operating system, etc.); but, instead of page views, your computer sends us information on the content, advertisement or game viewed or installed by the Raptr Features and the website and time. Additionally, the Raptr Features allow us to collect information regarding the games you have installed and uninstalled on your computer and what time you start and stop playing a game.
Community & Support
We provide customer service support through email and feedback forms. In order to provide customer support, we will ask for your email address. Aside from this information, we do not ask for any personal information to provide customer support. We only use information received from customer support requests, including email addresses, for customer support services and we do not transfer or share this information with any third parties.
You can also post questions and answer other user questions in our community forums. Our forum and messaging services allow you to participate in our gaming community; to do so, we maintain information, such as your user ID, contact list, and status messages, including what game you are currently playing (if you explicitly choose to enable this option). In addition, these and similar services in the future may require us to maintain your User ID and password.
Surveys
From time-to-time, we request information from users via surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as your email address), and demographic information (such as interests or age level). Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of the Raptr Features and will not be transferred to third parties.
How do we n use the information you provide us?
As stated above, we use your personal information such as your name, user ID and email address to maintain your user account. We also will use your email address to contact you when we provide customer support and to inform you when another user has sent you a private message or posted a comment for you on the website.
In addition, from time to time, we may also use your email address to send you information on updates to the Raptr Features, and unless you choose not to be included, to alert you to offerings from other companies that we are affiliated with. To opt out of receiving these emails, please see the section below titled "How do you opt out?" We will not ever sell your email address or send you offerings from companies that we are not affiliated with.
We may also provide aggregated information about our visitors to outside parties from time to time. For further details, please see the section below titled "Does Raptr disclose the information it collects to outside parties?"
We may use the information we collect to tailor your experience through the Raptr Features by displaying content according to your interests and preferences, providing a faster method for you to access your account and submit information to us and allowing us to contact you, if necessary.
How does Raptr protect customer information?
We implement a variety of security measures to ensure the security of your personal information on our systems. User personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of employees who have special access rights to such systems. We continue to store your personal information for so long as it is necessary to provide you our service and currently do not anticipate destroying old personal information. In most cases, we will at a minimum keep one archival copy of your information to allow us to comply with laws or respond to legal processes.
Does Raptr disclose the information it collects from its visitors to outsideparties?
We will never sell or rent your email address or any of your personal information. Unless we get your explicit approval in advance, we will only share your personal information as we believe is necessary to:

allow for advertising and other audits, and surveys to, among other things, validate the size and composition of the gaming audience, and understand its experience with the Raptr client and service.

Our Site uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses cookies, which are text files placed on your computer, to help the website analyze how users use the site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other services relating to website activity and Internet usage.

Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google.
We, and third parties, may from time to time make software applications and game downloads available for your use on or through the Raptr Features. These applications may separately access, and allow a third party to view, your identifiable information, such as your name, your user ID, your computer's IP Address or other information such as what game you are playing during any given session, and any cookies that you may previously have installed or that were installed for you by a third party software application or website.

You are encouraged to read the terms and other policies published by such third parties on their websites or otherwise.
In an attempt to provide increased value to our visitors, we may choose various third party web sites to link to, and frame within, the Site. We may also participate in co-branding and other relationships to offer e-commerce and other services and features to our visitors. However, even if the third party is affiliated with us, we have no control over these linked sites, each of which has separate privacy and data collection practices independent of us. Data collected by our co-brand partners or third party web sites (even if offered on or through our site) may not be received by us. As such, we have no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or actions, and are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any such web sites. These linked sites are only for your convenience and you therefore access them at your own risk. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of the Raptr Features and the links placed upon each of them and therefore request any feedback on not only the Raptr Features, but for sites each links to as well (including if a specific link does not work).
