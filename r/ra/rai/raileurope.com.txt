Privacy Policy
Rail Europe North America, Inc. (“Rail Europe,” “we,” “us” and “our”) respects your privacy and we want you to understand the ways in which we collect and use information about you. This Privacy Policy applies to information you provide to Rail Europe through our website, via RailEurope.com, raileurope.ca or raileurope.mx (“RailEurope.com Site”), through Rail Europe mobile applications, or over the phone to Rail Europe employees. Please review this Privacy Policy carefully. You are agreeing to its terms by visiting or using RailEurope.com Site. Notice of all changes that materially affect ways in which your personally identifiable information may be used or shared will be posted in updates to our Privacy Policy. If you continue to use the RailEurope.com Site after notice of changes have been sent to you or published on RailEurope.com Site, you hereby provide your consent to the changed practices.
Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to information that our affiliates may collect, or for use of our websites outside of the jurisdiction noted in our Terms of Use. Please visit any such other site, as applicable, in order to review those policies and manage your communication preferences.
Collection, Use, and Accessing of Information
Information Collection
Whether you make a purchase, register for an account, or are just a visitor, we are very careful with what we do with your information. Collection of information is usually grouped into two categories: personally identifiable, which is information identifiable to a specific user, and non-personally identifiable, which is defined by this Privacy Policy as general demographic information (gender, age, zip code), as well as RailEurope.com Site-wide usage information (route and destination popularity, pages visited, promotion participation levels), device, browser, and geo-location.
We collect non-personally identifiable information when it is affirmatively provided or passively when you use our website or mobile applications. We may use non-personally identifiable information for any purpose or disclose it to anyone. Where the two categories of information are combined, the resulting information is treated as personally identifiable information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.
In order to provide our services, including obtaining rail tickets on your behalf, we must, by necessity, coordinate with, and provide some of your personal information to, companies in the EU and North America that we do not control. As a result, your personal information may be stored or processed on computers located outside your jurisdiction of residence, and in jurisdictions whose data protection laws may differ from the jurisdiction in which you live. This information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement officials and national security authorities in those jurisdictions according to laws in those jurisdictions.
In many cases, you can view the RailEurope.com Site without telling us who you are or revealing any personally identifiable information. However, if you wish to purchase a rail pass or other ticket, you will have to provide information required of any traveler. This includes your name, and your email address, as well as the names of anyone traveling with you. If you select an age-specific ticket or pass, such as “youth” or “senior,” you also must provide your age group and that of anyone traveling with you, as applicable. Further, you must provide us with your valid payment information, including credit card numbers and expirations dates (all such foregoing information, collectively, “Data”).
Since Rail Europe is only the distributor of products and services provided by third parties (“Suppliers”), we also are collecting your Data on behalf of those Suppliers. For example, these Suppliers will need each traveler’s name and age group for identification purposes and to verify that each pass or other ticket is being used in accordance with that Supplier’s terms and conditions. Our collection of and disclosure of your Data is a required part of your transaction, and you agree by engaging in such transactions on the RailEurope.com Site to such collection and disclosure.
If you make purchases with us often, you may want to set up an account with us by registering on the RailEurope.com Site. This will make it easier for you to complete your purchases quickly. As a registered RailEurope.com Site user, you also may elect to receive newsletters and similar emails from us with travel news and information. Registered users of the RailEurope.com Site should be mindful of password-entry requirements and not disclose account numbers or passwords to others. Please read the Terms of Use for further information about your rights and responsibilities in maintaining an account with us.
Apart from purchases and registration, from time-to-time, we also request information via surveys, contests, in sweepstakes or other promotions, polls, and you may send questions or comments to us via email. In such cases, we will collect personally identifiable information when you choose to participate in sweepstakes or other promotions, fill out surveys, complete polls, or send questions or comments to us via email. Please read below for more information on how we use information collected through these means. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring the use of this site and improving customer satisfaction. Participation in these activities is completely voluntary and you may choose whether or not to participate and therefore disclose this information.
We do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13, and require that those making purchases on the RailEurope.com Site be 18 years of age or older and the age of legal majority in the jurisdiction where they reside. Should a child whom we know to be under 13 send personal information to us, we will use that information only to respond directly to that child to inform him or her that we must have parental consent before receiving his or her personal information. Each travel product or service also may be subject to age restrictions, and we reserve the right to impose further restrictions on those or similar purchases.
Data Use for Transactional and Promotional Purposes by Rail Europe
We and our service providers who assist us in connection with RailEurope.com Site operations may retain and use Data and other personally identifiable information, as well as non-personally identifiable information, in providing the RailEurope.com Site to you, which uses may include, without limitation, the following:
* to facilitate your purchases of rail, car and travel passes and other ticketed travel products and services that we distribute;
* to complete your travel-product purchase transactions by disclosing your Data to our Suppliers

* for any other purpose disclosed to you at the time you are asked to submit your personally identifiable information.
Information Uses Involving Third Parties
As noted above, Rail Europe is a distributor of our Suppliers’ products and services, and, as a required part of travel, each of our Suppliers must have access to the names and age groups of each traveler for whom a pass or other ticket is purchased for its product or service. We do not provide this information to our Suppliers for their direct marketing purposes, and to our knowledge and belief, our Suppliers do not use the personal information we provide to them for reasons other than completing your travel-related transactions.
Rail Europe also provides services through various referral partners and travel agencies. If you enter the RailEurope.com Site from the site of one of our marketing or referral partners, our system may recognize the path you have taken. Once you have left a partner’s site and/or begin the purchase transaction on RailEurope.com Site, those partners do not have access to the personal information you provide through our Site. Such information is treated as Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We also may track the path you have taken, combined with what purchases you may make, to gauge the success of our online marketing and promotional campaigns.
In addition to purchasing tickets through the RailEurope.com Site, you may have an opportunity to provide information directly to our marketing or referral partners, whether through the RailEurope.com Site or on a partner’s web site, or to third parties who merely maintain links on the RailEurope.com Site. These third parties may maintain separate privacy policies governing the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information, which you should review for more information. Once you leave the RailEurope.com Site, use of any information you provide will be governed by the privacy policy of that site’s operator. We, our parent companies, affiliates and subsidiaries are not responsible for the collection, use and disclosure practices with respect to personally identifiable and other information of third parties.
As noted, from time to time, we may survey you for your opinion, offer participation in sweepstakes, and conduct reviews to enhance the RailEurope.com Site. We also send you newsletters to which you have subscribed. For each of these, we may rely on service providers to help us collect and analyze research, administer the sweepstakes, and provide technical support in sending the newsletters and other, similar emails. We do not disclose any Data included in this information for such providers’ direct marketing purposes, nor so they may pass it on to others for the same reasons.
Information Use for Site Operations, Corporate and Legal Compliance
We may use or disclose your personally identifiable information as is permitted by this Privacy Policy, or according to the Terms of Use. This includes:
* performing standard business operations, such as transaction, payment processing, billing, collections, and accounting
* protecting our and our content providers’ business interests, including ensuring RailEurope.com Site operation and adherence to the Terms of Use and Usage Rules;
* investigating or helping to prevent unlawful activity or activity that may threaten our visitors, users, employees, or property; and
* in cooperating with law-enforcement investigations, or as required by law or by, subpoena, warrant, or other order of the court or governmental agency;
* to prevent harm to person or property;
* from time to time we may transfer information to our Affiliates in France in order to provide the services;
To help us perform these functions, we may retain third parties to whom we disclose personal information. These third parties include our customer-service providers, who handle your inquiries and store your Data; credit-card, debit-card and similar transaction processors; technical-service providers or similar entities that maintain the RailEurope.com Site operations; attorneys; accountants; auditors; and authorized government entities or other lawfully authorized parties. We may also disclose your personal and other information to our parent companies, affiliates or subsidiaries; content providers; and to third parties in conjunction with the reorganization or sale of our stock or assets, or if we are involved in bankruptcy proceedings. We will do so only after taking steps to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected. Any third party to which we transfer or sell our assets will have the right to continue to use the personal and other information that you provided to us.

What is your data used for?
Rail Europe only collects and uses data concerning you for purposes that are precise and limited to what is necessary for you, namely:
● processing your orders:
— enabling carriers and travel partners to provide you with services ordered,
— ensuring payment for the products that you have purchased,
— providing assistance to users of Rail Europe sites by email, or chat, when they request assistance for an order, for connecting to the sites or accessing their customer accounts,
— monitoring and providing after sales service for products ordered (information, cancellations, reimbursements, exchange, complaints),
— helping making orders: if you do not complete an order made on the Rail Europe site, Rail Europe may send you an email offering its help;
● managing your customer account: at Rail Europe, the customer account is not mandatory. However, it is very useful because it is an account that is entirely dedicated to you and makes it easy for you to:
— easily give orders (automatic entry of your data: identification and travel preferences),
— access your order data;
● communicate with you: for Rail Europe, maintaining contact with you is essential, but we only do it in a carefully controlled manner and we only send you electronic communications, via email, SMS or mobile notification, for the following reasons:
—  monitoring orders: sending confirmations of orders and any other messages related to the service that you have ordered,
—  the management of your customer account: confirmation of creation or closure, modification of passwords,

— validate your order;
