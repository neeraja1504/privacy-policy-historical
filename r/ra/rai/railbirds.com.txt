The website lets you communicate across the internet in various ways. This includes forums, blogs, mail, diaries etc.
We take privacy and confidentiality seriously and recognise that, when you choose to provide us with information about yourself, you trust us to act in a responsible way.

The other is your private profile, which contains information which only you and we can see. You use these profiles to access the website and post information on the site, these postings may also contain personal information about you.
Any information you provide us is given voluntarily by you, and it is up to you to decide what information you post on the site.
