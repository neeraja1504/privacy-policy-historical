Why personal information is collected
The primary reason for collecting information is to provide customers and other users with a service and a smooth, efficient and personalised experience while using our sites. For example, if you purchase products or request information on the sites, we use your personal information to fill your order or provide the requested information. IoTize SAS may collect personal Information from you to complete various transactions, such as:
product or service orders
product activations and registrations
profile creation
information requests
support subscriptions
contest entries or survey participation
job applications
What information is collected
IoTize SAS collects and uses your personal information to better serve you and personalise your experience and interaction with our company. Such collection is done with appropriate notice and consent, along with required filings with data protection authorities, where applicable.
Personal information (or personal data) means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ('data subject'); an identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to his physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity.
This privacy statement does not cover personal information rendered anonymous or where pseudonyms are used. Data is rendered anonymous if individual persons are no longer identifiable or are identifiable only with a disproportionately large expense in time, cost, or effort. The use of pseudonyms involves the replacement of names or other identifiers with substitutes, so that identification of individual persons is either impossible or at least rendered considerably more difficult. If data rendered anonymous becomes no longer anonymous (i.e., individual persons are again identifiable), or if pseudonyms are used and the pseudonyms allow identification of individual persons, then this privacy statement will again apply.
It is always up to you whether to disclose personal information to us, although if you elect not to do so, we reserve the right not to register you as a user or provide you with any products or services.
The types of personal information we collect from you may include:
your name, company, email address, phone number, billing address and shipping address
customer type, job function, job title, purchasing authority, purchasing timeframe and others
product and service preferences, contact preferences, educational and employment background, and job interest data

credit card information (where  applicable)
IP address (see chapter on cookies)
