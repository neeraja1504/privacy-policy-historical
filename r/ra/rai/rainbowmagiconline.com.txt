CHILDREN'S PRIVACY
Children can surf our Web Sites, view content, and download materials without HIT Entertainment Limited collecting PII. To enable their participation in certain of the interactive features at our site, we may ask children to provide us with PII. For example, we may collect an e-mail address from a child for the sole purpose of responding directly to a specific online request (e.g., to send electronic postcards; to participate in a contest, sweepstakes, or competition; or to ask a question or send a comment). We also may collect a child's and a parent's online contact information in order to send the child periodic communications, such as online newsletters, site updates, or password reminders.
