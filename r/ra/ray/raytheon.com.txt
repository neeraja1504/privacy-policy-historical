We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect the personal information You provide against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use.  While Raytheon makes extensive effort to prevent unauthorized access to personal information, the security of information transmitted via the internet cannot be guaranteed.

Country, State and Regional Specific Data Privacy Information
8. Children's Privacy (COPPA) in the US
We have implemented additional privacy safeguards when we collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13.
8.1 Raytheon encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with their children. We urge parents to instruct their children not to provide their real names, email or physical addresses, or telephone numbers online without the permission of a parent or guardian. We recognize a special obligation to protect personal information obtained from children, as may be collected on the Children's Sites only. We fully comply with the U.S. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA"), which requires us to take special precautions when collecting personal information from children under the age of 13.
8.2 In compliance with COPPA, we have adopted the following policies to help keep children safe.
Any personal information we collect from children under the age of 13 will be used solely by Raytheon or its agents for internal purposes only and will not be sold or otherwise distributed to third parties.
We will not knowingly allow children under the age of 13 to access any social media site that may exist on the Site, email accounts, or other services within Raytheon that would allow them to publicly post or otherwise distribute personal information.
We will not knowingly ask a child under the age of 13 to divulge more information than is needed to participate in any activity, game, or service.
We will not knowingly keep any personal information that is inadvertently included in a child's email submission, help inquiry, or other one-time request, if we know that the child is under the age of 13. Information will be automatically purged or purged immediately after the issue has been resolved.
We will not knowingly post any personal information that is inadvertently included in a child's submission to a general audience contribution area if we know that the child is under the age of 13. These submissions will be deleted and handled anonymously thereafter.
We will not knowingly provide any direct link to websites that are unsuitable for children or teens.
Upon request, we will provide a parent or guardian with a description of the information that may have been provided about their child during a registration process for a program, service or contest on the Site.
8.3 Consistent with COPPA, there are several instances in which we collect information from children, such as:
Requesting the contact information of a parent or guardian for the sole purpose of notifying the parent or guardian;
Collecting children's contact information on a one-time basis, such as when they enter a contest or ask Raytheon a question using the "contact us" link on our Sites. We will use this information on a one-time basis solely to directly respond to the child's request. We will purge the child's contact information from our systems when we have fulfilled the request, such as after we respond to the child's email or when a contest is over. We will not use children's information to re-contact them or for any other purpose other than fulfilling their requests;
Collecting a child's contact information and the contact information of his/her parent or guardian solely to respond directly more than once to a specific request from the child (for example, to satisfy the request for a newsletter subscription). In this instance, the parent or guardian will be notified that the child made such a request and be informed of the information provided by the child. The parent or guardian will have an opportunity at any time to revoke the child's request (i.e., unsubscribe). We will not use the child's personal information to re-contact the child for any other purpose; and
Using cookies to collect non-personally-identifiable information on our child-directed Sites for analytics and internal operations purposes.

10. European Union/European Economic Area and Switzerland
If You are located in the European Union ("EU") / European Economic Area ("EEA") or otherwise protected by European data protection law, the following applies.
10.1 EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework
To provide an adequate level of protection for personal information received from the EU/EEA, Raytheon participates in the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework ("Privacy Shield" or the "Framework").  Raytheon adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information transferred from the EU and the United Kingdom to the United States, which includes personal information about Raytheon EU employees, job applicants and individual contacts of business partners and customers. We provide notice to EU employees through separate internal company policies, and to job applicants through our recruiting and job posting websites.

We may transfer the personal information we collect to recipients in countries other than the country in which the information originally was collected. Those countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which the information was initially provided.
If there is any conflict between the terms in this Section on Privacy Shield and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern to the extent of the conflict. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program visit www.privacyshield.gov, and to located and view our certification, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/list.
10 .1.1 Choices
In addition to the rights provided under local law, You are afforded under Privacy Shield a specific right to access Your personal information. You may also have the right to exercise choices (opt-out) from our use of Your personal information for direct marketing purposes. To exercise this right, please follow the instructions in any direct marketing message You may have received. We do not otherwise use or disclose Your personal information in a manner that is subject to choice requirements under the Framework.
10.1.2 Recourse, Enforcement, and Liability
Please contact us as specified below in Section 13 if You have any questions, need access to Your personal information, or otherwise need assistance. We remain responsible for our collection, use and disclosure of Your personal information in accordance with the Framework. We also are responsible for third party agents that are processing such personal information on our behalf, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. In certain situations, we may be required to disclose Your personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including meeting national security or law enforcement requirements.
If You have an unresolved concern about Your personal information that we have not addressed satisfactorily, we have committed to cooperate with the panel established by the EU Data Protection Authorities to serve as our independent dispute resolution body for the Framework. We are also subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission with respect to the Framework. In addition, under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website, individuals may invoke binding arbitration for non-monetary issues when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.
10.1.3 Contact Us
Please contact us using the contact information under in Section 13 below if You have any questions related to the Framework, wish to exercise Your rights of access, or wish to seek other assistance as described above.
10.2 Additional Information under the EU General Data Protection Regulation
This Section provides additional information as required by the EU General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR").
10.2.1 Data Controller and Legal grounds for the processing
If You are a Visitor of the Sites, Raytheon Company as identified in Section 13 is the data controller of Your personal data. If You are a business partner or customer, the Raytheon entity with whom You interact is the data controller. Please contact Raytheon Company in order to receive the contact details of such other Raytheon entity acting as Your data controller.
Raytheon relies on the following legal grounds for the processing of Your personal information as provided under the GDPR:
The processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of You which require protection of personal data, in particular if You are a child; such legitimate interests are the provision of the Sites and its services as requested by You, the promotion and advertisement of our services, communicating with you, and compliance with legal obligations and internal policies and procedures (Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR)
Your consent to the processing of Your personal information for one or more specific purposes;
the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which You are a party or to take steps at Your request prior to entering into a contract;
the processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject;
The provision of Your personal information is typically not required by law or contract and is therefore voluntary. However, if You do not provide Your personal information, Raytheon may not be able to make the Site and its services available to You and to response to Your request or inquiry. Similarly, if You have entered or want to enter into a contract with Raytheon, Your personal information may be necessary to pursue this purpose.
10.2.2 International transfers.
Raytheon is located in the US and You therefore need to expect that Raytheon and other recipients of Your personal information are located outside the EU/EEA.
Raytheon and its US affiliates are certified under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and thereby recognized as providing an adequate level of data protection from a European data protection law perspective.
Other recipients located outside of the EU/EEA are also certified under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield or are located in countries with adequacy decisions pursuant to Art. 45 GDPR (in particular, Canada (for non-public organizations subject to the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act), Switzerland, Israel), and, in each case, the transfer is thereby recognized as providing an adequate level of data protection from an European data protection law perspective.
Other recipients might be located in countries which do not adduce an adequate level of protection from an European data protection law perspective (in particular, certain recipients in the USA which are not certified under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield). We will take all necessary measures to ensure that transfers out of the EU/EEA are adequately protected as required by applicable data protection law.
With respect to transfers to countries not providing an adequate level of data protection, we will base the transfer on appropriate safeguards, such as standard data protection clauses adopted by the European Commission or by a supervisory authority (Art. 46(2)(c) or (d) GDPR), approved codes of conduct together with binding and enforceable commitments of the recipient (Art. 46 (2)(e) GDPR), or approved certification mechanisms together with binding and enforceable commitments of the recipient (Art. 46 (2)(f) GDPR). You can ask for a copy of such appropriate safeguards by contacting us as set out in Section 13 below.
The data transfers to Raytheon affiliates and other third-party service providers which are neither certified under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield nor in a country with other adequacy decision are typically protected by standard data protection clauses adopted by the European Commission (Art. 46(2)(c) or (d) GDPR).
10.2.3 Retention Periods
Your personal information is stored strictly to the extent necessary for the performance of our obligations and strictly for the time necessary to achieve the purposes for which the personal information is collected, in accordance with applicable data protection laws. When Raytheon no longer needs to use Your personal information, we will remove it from our systems and records and/or take steps to properly anonymize it so that You can no longer be identified from it (unless we need to keep Your personal information to comply with legal or regulatory obligations to which Raytheon is subject).
Personal information will in principle be deleted 3 years after the last interaction and business contact between You and Raytheon, unless a longer retention is necessary to protect our interests. However, we will retain Your contact details and interests in our products or services for a longer period of time if Raytheon is allowed to continue sending You marketing materials.
10.2.4 Your Rights under GDPR
In addition to or supplementing the rights set out above in Section 5 and 9, You have the following rights under GDPR: (i) request access to Your personal information; (ii) request rectification of Your personal information; (iii) request erasure of Your personal information; (iv) request restriction of processing of Your personal information; (v) request data portability; (vi) object to the processing of Your personal information (including objection to profiling), and (vi) withdrawal of Your consent at any time.

However, this is not an absolute right and the interests of other individuals may restrict Your right of access. You may have the right to obtain a copy of the personal information undergoing processing free of charge. For further copies requested by You, we may charge a reasonable fee based on administrative costs.
Right to request rectification: As provided by applicable data protection law, **** You have the right to obtain from us the rectification of inaccurate personal information concerning You. Depending on the purposes of the processing, You may have the right to have incomplete personal information completed, including by means of providing a supplementary statement.
Right to request erasure (right to be forgotten): As provided by applicable data protection law, Y ou have the right to obtain from us the erasure of personal information concerning You and we may be obliged to erase such personal information.
Right to request restriction of processing: As provided by applicable data protection law, You have the right to obtain from us that we restrict the processing of Your personal information. In such case, the respective information will be marked and may only be processed by us for certain purposes.
Right to request data portability: As provided by applicable data protection law, **** You have the right to receive the personal information concerning You, which You have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and You may have the right to transmit those information to another entity without hindrance from us.
Right to object:
Under certain circumstances, You have the right to object, on grounds relating to Your particular situation, at any time to the processing of Your personal information by us and we are required to no longer process Your personal information. Such right to object especially applies if we collect and process Your personal information for profiling purposes in order to better understand Your interests in our products and services or for certain types of direct marketing.
If You have a right to object and if You exercise this right, Your personal information will no longer be processed for such purposes by us.
Such a right to object may, in particular, not exist if the processing of Your personal information is necessary to take steps prior to entering into a contract or to perform a contract already concluded.
Right to withdraw Your consent: If You have declared Your consent regarding certain collecting, processing and use of Your personal information (in particular regarding the receipt of direct marketing communication via email, SMS/MMS, fax, and telephone), You can withdraw this consent at any time with future effect. Such a withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of the processing prior to the consent withdrawal.
To exercise Your rights, please contact us as stated under Section 13 below.You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the competent data protection supervisory authority in the relevant Member State (e.g., the place where You reside, work, or of an alleged infringement of the GDPR).
