Our Secure Ordering
When you make an online purchase, our advanced security technology encrypts and scrambles your personal data (including your name, delivery and email addresses and credit card number) before it is sent to us, making it virtually impossible for anyone other than RATUU Inc. to read it. To further protect your information, we utilize state of the art back-end systems and restrict employee access to your information. Unless specifically authorized by you, no outside party is able to access or receive any of your personal customer information.
Information We Collect
In designing our website, we started with the simple belief that customer service is our number one priority. Therefore, the customer information we collect is used to enhance our services to you, our customer.
When you visit our website, we collect non-personal information about your visit:
We collect your IP address, browser type, domain name, and we log the length of time of your visit and the number of times you visit and purchase from us. We assign you a unique internal identifier to help keep track of your future visits. We use this information to gather aggregate demographic information about our visitors, and we use it to personalize the information you see on our website and the emails you receive from us (should you grant us permission to send to you). We keep this information for our internal use; we do not share it with others. This information is in no way tied to your personal information, including your email address.
RATUU.COM uses tracking technologies
We use tracking technologies to send anonymous information about your browsing habits to a third party company.
When you subscribe to our newsletters, RATUU Inc. asks you for contact information
When you sign up for our newsletters we use your name and email address to send you our health newsletters and to inform you of sales and special offers. When you submit a product review on our website, you are required to log into your customer account. Your comments, first name, city, and state will be displayed. However, no information that would allow others to contact you will be disclosed by RATUU.COM. Your information will be used for no other purpose than to allow you to submit product reviews.
Recommend a product to a friend
The information collected (friend's name and email address) is used to send a one-time only email to the friend letting them know about the product that the user recommends. If you place an online order, our secure order form requests contact, billing, and financial information (such as your credit card numbers for purchases). Contact information from the order form (email address, name, billing and shipping address, and phone number) is used to send orders and information about our company to you. Your contact information, including email address, is also used to get in touch with you should we have questions regarding your order or should we need to notify you of the status of your order. The credit card information we collect is used to bill you for products you purchase, and if you provide prior consent, this information may also be shared with a third party partner. For your convenience, your information including credit card and order history is stored on a secure server that allows you to reorder by entering your email address and password. You may also place a Set & Save order that will allow you to receive products on a regular basis without the need to reenter that order every time. You may cancel this order at any time by sending an email to help@ratuu.com or calling 1-213-765-0400
We have several types of third-party relationships
We use third-party intermediaries. When you purchase from us, we send your credit card information, name, and billing address to credit card companies for verification and to authorize your purchase. We use outside shipping companies to fulfill orders. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally i dentifiable information, including email address, for any other purposes. We provide certain third-party offers for your consideration. Should you choose to place an order with one of these partners, we may share certain information, including email address, necessary to facilitate your transaction with them. We will always ask for your consent prior to sharing your information with anyone. RATUU.COM handles the sending of order related and customer service related messages internally, as well as advertising related emails. RATUU.COM service providers do not retain nor use your personal information, including your email address for any other purpose except to provide the service on our behalf. We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies.
Our affiliates may have access to transaction-level data
Our third-party affiliate program offers a feature that may allow a small number of selected affiliates to gain access to individual user transaction information that originates from links on their websites. These affiliates generally include, but are not limited to, rebate sites, member sites, charity fund-raising sites, school fund-raising sites, and association sites. To properly track and credit the customer's transaction, these sites may give each of their members a unique code, which will uniquely identify the member or the member's organization. This code is activated only when the customer links directly from the affiliate site to RATUU.COM. Any transactions made at RATUU.COM while the code is active will be reported back to the affiliate. RATUU Inc. never passes on personal data as part of this feature. We will provide only the date of the transaction, the amount of the transaction, and the product purchased. To further protect the privacy of our customers, we require all affiliates requesting this feature to sign a statement promising to inform users beforehand of any such data collection, and to guarantee that any data collected will be used solely to reward users (or their selected charities) for their purchases. If you are concerned about having your purchase tracked in this manner, you may avoid it by visiting RATUU.COM directly (without linking from an affiliate site). If the affiliate site has not made its tracking procedures clear to you, please notify us by email.
We occasionally run our own online surveys
During a survey, we will ask visitors for contact information (such as email address) and demographic information (such as zip code, age, or income level). We use contact data from our surveys to send users information about our company. You may opt out of the survey and also opt out of any future mailings at the time of the survey. The demographic information is used to learn more about the types of people who visit our site. This information is not shared with any other parties currently. We reserve the right to share this information with other parties in the future in an aggregated format that would not disclose any personally identifiable information.

If you decide that you would like to opt out from receiving newsletters from us, our emails provide you with the opportunity to stop receiving these communications. You may also opt out by sending an email to help@ratuu.com.
