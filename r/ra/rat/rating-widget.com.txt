Privacy Policy | RatingWidget
Welcome to Rating-Widget.com! We operate the Rating-Widget ratings service and platform (collectively, the “Service”), which makes gathering users' feedback on the web easy. We provide this privacy policy to let you know about how we gather and use personal information and user data collected by us in connection with use of the Service. We will take reasonable steps to protect user privacy consistent with the guidelines set forth in this policy and with applicable U.S. laws. In this policy, “user” or “you” means any individual or enterprise using the Service, whether as the enterprise customer purchasing the Service or an authorized user of the Service.
By using Rating-Widget, you agree to:
BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND OUR TERMS OF SERVICE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, DO NOT USE THE SERVICE.
What Information Do We Collect?
Limited personal information: We collect the following personal information in connection with the Service: (a) when you register to use the Service on behalf of an Website (the “Licensee”) we will collect the business information for the Licensee Website, such as name and address, and contact details, such as name, email address, physical address and telephone, for a contact person of the Website; (b) if you communicate with us by email, we will collect your email address. All of this information is referred to in this Policy as “Personal Information”.
Rating & Votes Information: The Service is a voting application, designed for use by Website's administrators, a control which enables rating elements of content in your site by your Website Visitors (the “Visitors”). In order to provide information to Users and their Visitors, the Service relies on votes data supplied to Rating-Widget by Visitors of the Licensee and on data generated by use of the Service by all Visitors, including all votes sent to Rating-Widget by the Visitors (collectively, all of this data is referred to in this Policy as the “Voting Data”).
Web Tracking Information: We, and our third party service providers, may use web tracking technologies such as cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and clear GIFs in order to operate the Service efficiently and to collect data related to usage of the Service. Such collected data (“Web Tracking Information”) may include the address of the websites your Web visitors visited before and after they visited pages with the Service, the type of browser they are using, your Internet Protocol (IP) address, what pages in the Service you visit and what links you clicked on, and whether you opened email communications we send to you. In order to collect Web Tracking Information and to make your visitors use of the Service more efficient, we may store cookies on their computer. We may also use web tracking technologies that are placed in web pages on the Service or in email communications to collect information about actions that users take when they interact with the Service or such email communications, and Rating-Widget’s Contractors (as hereinafter defined) may also do so. We do not correlate Web Tracking Information to individual user Personal Information. Some Web Tracking Information may include data, such as IP address data, that is unique to your Visitors. You and your Visitors may be able to modify their browser settings to alter which web tracking technologies are permitted when they visit pages with the Service, but this may affect the performance of the Service.
GDPR Compliance
We do not collect any personal data about your visitors.
We introduced two helper client-side methods: RW.optIn() and RW.optOut(). You can leverage those with your cookies consent opt-in/out logic.
We are no longer storing visitor IPs. Instead, we store anonymized IPs - a non-personal data.
Device ID cookies are no longer created for EU visitors unless you manually integrate a cookies consent on your site and they opt-in via the RW.optIn() method.
As a visitor, you can opt-out form our cookies here:
As a site owner, you'll need to add a section to your cookies policy (or privacy policy), mentioning that you're using the RatingWidget service and add an opt-out button which will call RW.optOut() to opt-out any visitor from cookies. You can use the following paragraph:
We use RatingWidget as a feedback mechanism for our visitors, providing them with an easy way to cast their opinion. The service is using cookies to avoid duplicate votes from the same device. Here's a link to RatingWidget's privacy policy. You can opt-out from their voter tracking cookies by clicking the Opt out button on their privacy page.
