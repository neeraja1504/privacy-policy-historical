7. Social Media Plug-ins
We place various social media buttons on our website in the form of a link. Following are the social media buttons used but not limited:
Facebook
Twitter
Instagram
Pinterest
Reddit
Please be aware that by visiting a website which integrates social media plugins, certain data (your current IP address, visited sites, the date and time the website etc.) is forwarded to these social media services even if you are not registered with these services.
If you are already logged into the social media service when you click on the social media button, the social media service may also use this data to identify your user name and possibly even your real name. We have no control over the extent, nature and purpose of such data processing by the social media service. Please note that the social media service is perfectly capable of using this data to create pseudonymized and even individualized user profiles.
We leave it up to you on whether you want your personal data to be forwarded to social media services by using the so-called 2-Click-Method. The 2-Click Method refers to a technique of protecting consumers’ identity where a social media button appears on a website. The 2-Click system uses static links that require the social media buttons to be “activated” by a user before any data is transferred to the social media server. A button is activated with the first “click”. Once it has been activated, the social media service has access to all the above-mentioned information. The user will, with a second “click”, be able to interact with the website using his or her profile on the activated social media platform, e.g. by sharing or liking a post.
8. Security Measures
We adopt technical and organizational measures to protect your data as comprehensively as possible. In addition to the commitment of our employees to secrecy and a careful selection and monitoring of our service providers, we also secure our operating environment adequately.
To protect your data against unwanted access, we use data encryption. Data collected from this website will be passed between your computer and our server and vice versa via the internet using data encryption in transit technology by using 256-Bit TLS (Transport Layer Security) encryption. If the connection is encrypted the ‘lock’ symbol on your browser status list will show as locked, and the address line will start with “https://”. We will not use encryption if you exchange only generally available information with us. Data stored in our database is encrypted using data encryption in storage technology by using 256-Bit AES encryption.
9. Transfer to third parties
We may disclose your personal information to third parties such as our professional advisers, our external and internal service providers that provide services to us (such as distribution of newsletters, IT hosting and market research). We may disclose your personal information for the purposes set out above and only for specific purposes according to the relevant data protection laws. Those service providers are bound to process your personal data only on our strict instructions and when they can offer adequate technical and organizational measures to protect your data.
We may also disclose your personal information if it is required or authorized by law, where disclosure is necessary to prevent a threat to life, health or safety, or where we are otherwise permitted by the relevant data protection laws.
