ZUJI will endeavour to take all reasonable steps to keep secure any Personal Information which we hold about you. Your Personal Information is stored on secure servers that are protected in controlled facilities. Unfortunately, despite the aforementioned technology and security features, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot give an absolute assurance that the Personal Information you provide to us will be secure at all times, and we cannot be responsible for any event arising from unauthorised access to your Personal Information. ZUJI will not be held responsible for events arising from third parties gaining unauthorized access to your Personal Information.
Please note also that ZUJI may use overseas facilities to process or back up your Personal Information. As a result, we may transfer to and store your Personal Information at our overseas facilities.

Whenever you login as a member on ZUJI, particularly on somebody else's computer or on public internet terminals, you should always logout at the end of your session. Your assistance will help us protect the privacy of your Personal Information.
ZUJI cannot be held responsible for lapses in security caused by third party accesses to your Personal Information as a result of your failure to keep your Personal Information private. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you must notify us immediately if there is any unauthorised use of your account by any other internet user or any other breach of security.
