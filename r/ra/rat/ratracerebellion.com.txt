Privacy Policy - Work From Home Jobs by Rat Race Rebellion
PRIVACY POLICY
At Staffcentrix we recognize that privacy is important, and we are committed to safeguarding your information when you are visiting any of our sites (Staffcentrix.com, RatRaceRebellion.com).
This Privacy Policy discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for this site.
Personal Information
This site gathers personal information when you register for any service we are offering or when you voluntarily provide such information. Your personal information is never shared with third parties; however, it may be included among any statistics we generate regarding this site. That is, you will be “just a number” among many if we do share information with third parties, i.e., the Rat Race Rebellion has tens of thousands of visitors (and you may be one of them)!
Log Files / Statistics Trackers
Like the majority of websites, we do track and record information when you visit our website. Data collected and recorded includes the referring URL (where you clicked on a link to arrive here), IP address, browser type, country, platform type, type of domain (network, commercial, military, etc.), and date and time. This data does not link to personally identifiable information and is used, in the aggregate, to help us track the areas of greatest interest, responses to publications outreach, and other details that help us make this site as relevant as possible to our visitors.
Newsletters
When a person subscribes to one of our email newsletters (distributed via Constant Contact) we ask for an email address (required) and other optional information. Subscribers may opt-out of these communications at any time by using the “unsubscribe” feature that is included in every communication.
Cookies
This site does not use cookies (a piece of code that is placed on a user’s computer and tied to information about the user) except in instances when the user has entered a password to access information that is password-protected.
_ Advertiser Cookies_
We use third-party advertising vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a user’s prior visits to your website or other websites. Google’s use of advertising cookies enables it and its partners to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and/or other sites on the Internet. Users may opt out of personalized advertising by visiting Ads Settings.

Advertisers
This site is supported, in whole or in part, by advertisements from outside companies. As noted above, these ads may contain cookies set by the advertiser, for their own purposes, and we do not have access to or control of the information they gather.

If you submit a testimonial to us using the contact form on our site, then you agree that we may publish your testimonial, together with your name (we may also use a first name- last initial format), on this website, on such page and in such position as we may determine in our sole discretion.
You further agree that we may edit the testimonial and publish edited or partial versions of the testimonial. However, we will never edit a testimonial in such a way as to create a misleading impression of your views.
