Privacy Policy
Last Updated: April 29, 2019.
Ratehub Inc. (“ Ratehub ”/“ we ”/” us ”) is committed to protecting your privacy. We make the Ratehub website, www.ratehub.ca  (the “ Website ”) available together with our services as further described in our terms of use (the “ Services ”). This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, store, use and distribute information about our users through the Website and Services.
Consent: By using the Website or our Services you consent to the use of your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy. Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, your Personal Information will not be used for any other purpose without your consent. We don’t sell customer lists without your consent. You may withdraw your consent to our processing of your Personal Information at any time. However, withdrawing consent may result in your inability to continue using all of the features available on the Website and/or the Services.
Collection of Information : We aim to collect, use and disclose only such information as is required to enable us to manage your account, to provide the Services, to maintain our customer/user lists, to respond to your inquiries or provide feedback, for identification and authentication purposes, and for service improvement. We will maintain the confidentiality of any contact information you provide to us when you sign up for our Services, marketing communications, or contact us with questions or for further information and we will use it only for the purposes for which we have collected it (subject to the exclusions and disclosures we have listed below), unless you agree that we may disclose it to other third parties.
Two types of information may be collected through the Website and our Services: Personal Information and Website Information.
“ ** Personal Information** ” is personally identifiable information, such as your name, address, e-mail address, credit card information, address, birth date and gender. At the time of collection, we will clearly identify the information being collected and the purposes for which it will be used. It is always your choice whether or not to provide Personal Information but if you choose not to provide certain requested Personal Information, in some instances you may not be able to access and use all of the features of the Website and Services. In other instances, your choice not to provide certain other Personal Information may mean that you will not be able to use certain features of the Website. We may collect Personal Information in respect of the Website through registration process, request form submission, quote inquiries, communications with you; user support; online tools; and expert advice services.
“ ** Website Information** ” is information we collect when you visit our Website, such as an Internet Protocol Address (IP Address), the domain used to access the Website, and the type and version of browser or operating system being used by visitors to the Website.
We also collect aggregate information, such as demographic statistics of our users (e.g. average age or geographical allocation of our users), number of visitors, what pages users access or visit, and average time spent on the Website. Similarly, business contact information such as the name, title, business address, or telephone number of a business or professional person or an employee of an organization is not considered Personal Information when such information is used for the purposes of contacting the individual in their business/professional capacity.
Use of Information : We collect information for the following purposes:
Registration: You may be asked to register for an account to use the Services. If you choose to register for an account you must provide certain Personal Information to us such as your full name, address and email address. Unless you provide consent, none of your account registration information will be shared with any other users of the Website or our Services.
Request Forms: If you request more information about a certain third party product or service listed on our Website you may be required to input certain further Personal Information, such as name, contact information, address, and certain other information depending on the nature of the third party product or service you are interested in. If you submit such a request form, we will send the information contained in the form to the applicable third party offering the product or service , and you hereby consent to us sharing your Personal Information with such third party. Any Personal Information that we provide to third parties will be treated in accordance with the terms of such third party’s own Privacy Policy, which you should read. Ratehub.ca will not be responsible in any way for how any third party treats your Personal Information.
Online Tools: We may offer tools such as a mortgage calculator, Canada child benefit calculator, RESP calculator, TFSA Room calculator, and credit card finder. If you use these tools, we collect information you provide (such as your income, RESP balance, credit score, etc.) in order to provide you with the features and functions of the tools. Unless you provide consent, none of the information provided will be shared with any other users of the Website or our Services.
Insurance Quotes: If you request an insurance quote, you will be required to input your postal code. Once you submit your postal code, you will be automatically redirected to a third party website, hosted by one of our insurance provider partners. With the exception of your postal code, any information you submit in the insurance quote process will be submitted directly to such third party provider, and not to Ratehub.ca. Accordingly, your personal information will be treated in accordance with the privacy policy of the applicable third party insurance provider, and Ratehub.ca shall not be responsible for how any third party provider or Vendor treats your Personal Information.
Credit Reports: In order to obtain a free credit report, you will be required to input your name, email address, date of birth, income, phone number and address to the Website. We will provide this information to our partner Equifax. All the personal information we provide to Equifax will be subject to, and treated in accordance with the Equifax Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which you should read carefully. We will update your credit report regularly, and accordingly, will also use the personal information you provide in order to provide updated credit reports, which you can find in your account.
Location Information: Certain third party products and services are only available in certain areas, and therefore we may ask for your location, either by requesting your postal code, city, and/or address
Transactional Notifications: We provide notifications for certain activities relating to your use of our Services despite your indicated e-mail preferences, for example we may send you notices of any updates to our Terms of Use or Privacy Policy.
Marketing Communications: If you opt-in to receive marketing communications from us, we collect your name and email address to send you the newsletter you requested with information about our product and services and those of our partners. You may withdraw your consent to receiving marketing communications from us at any time by following the opt-out instructions in each communication, or by contacting our customer service department at [email protected].
Statistics: We also collect statistics about your use of third party products and services that you request information about through the Website. This information will be kept confidential, however, aggregate statistics that do not personally identify an individual will be kept by us and such aggregate statistics may be made available to other members or third parties.
System Logs & Cookies: Cookies are used by us to track content usage and traffic on the Website. A cookie is a feature of your web browser that consists of a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web server. The Website uses cookies to help it compile aggregate statistics about usage of this Website, such as how many users visit the Website, how long users spend viewing the Website, and what pages are viewed most often, and what pages Users may visit directly after leaving the Website. This information is used to improve the content of the Website and to provide and improve the Services. You can set your browser to notify you when you are sent a cookie. This gives you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. If you disable cookies, you may not be able to take advantage of all the features of the Website.
IP address: Your IP address is reported by your web browser whenever you visit a page on the Website. This information is recorded together with your registration information on our databases.
Analytics: We may use a third party such as Google Analytics to help us gather and analyze information about the areas visited on the Website (such as the pages most read, time spent, search terms and other engagement data) in order to evaluate and improve the user experience and the Website. For more information or to opt-out using the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, see “How Google uses data when you use our partners’ sites or apps” and “Google Analytics and Privacy”.
Interest- Based Advertising: Advertisements appearing on the Website may be delivered by us or one or more third-party web advertisers. These third party web advertisers may set cookies. These cookies allow the advertisement server operated by that third party to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. Accordingly, advertisement servers may compile information about where or whether you viewed their advertisements and which advertisements you clicked on. This information allows web advertisers to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.
We work with third-parties such as ad networks and other advertising companies that use their own tracking technologies (including cookies and pixel tags) on our Website in order to provide you with tailored advertisements across the Internet. These companies may collect information about your activity on our Website and third-party websites (such as web pages you visit and your interaction with our advertising and other communications) and use this information to make predictions about your preferences, develop personalized content and deliver ads that are more relevant to you on third party websites. This information may also be used to evaluate the effectiveness of our online advertising campaigns.
Opting-out of Interest-Based Advertising: For more information about interest-based advertising and to understand your options, including how you can opt-out of receiving behavioural ads from third-party advertising companies participating in the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada, please visit the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada website at http://youradchoices.ca/choices.
Please note that even if you opt-out of interest-based advertising by a third party, these tracking technologies may still collect data for other purposes including analytics and you will still see ads from us, but the ads will not be targeted based on behavioural information about you and may therefore be less relevant to you and your interests.
To successfully opt out, you must have cookies enabled in your web browser (see your browser’s instructions for information on cookies and how to enable them). Your opt-out only applies to the web browser you use so you must opt-out of each web browser on each computer you use.
