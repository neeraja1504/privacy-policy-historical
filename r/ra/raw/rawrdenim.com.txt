Privacy and Terms of Service - Heddels
Our Commitment to Your Privacy
Heddels values and respects your privacy, and we are committed to maintaining and using this information responsibly. This privacy policy addresses the use and disclosure of personal information we collect from you. By visiting our website, or providing your information to us, you are accepting and consenting to the practices described in this privacy policy.
Use and Collection of Information
Heddels collects customer information in an effort to improve your experience, to communicate with you about our content and promotions, and to enhance and improve the performance and accuracy of our operations and website. We collect information such as your name, e-mail and postal address and credit card numbers that you provide to us when you place an order, when you save your information with us or when you participate in a sweepstakes or promotion. We may use your information collected online to process and fulfill your order. We also collect e-mail addresses at various locations within the site including when you sign up for our newsletter or enter into a contest or giveaway. In addition, we maintain a record of your comments and whatever else might enable us to enhance and personalize your experience.
In the unlikely event of a sale of some or all of our business, Heddels may disclose your personal information to a purchaser that agrees to abide by the terms and conditions of this privacy policy.
You can always review, update and remove your information by contacting us at info@heddels.com. When you update your personal information, we may keep a copy of the prior version for our records.
Heddels may store some information on your computer in the form of a “cookie” or similar file. These files allow us to tailor our website to reflect your listed or historical preferences. Most web browsers allow web users to exercise control over such files on their computers by erasing them, blocking them, or notifying the user when such a file is stored. Please refer to your browser’s instructions to learn about those functions. Please note that if you disable or delete these files you may not have access to certain features and services that make your online experience more efficient and enjoyable. These and other technologies also allow delivery of advertising that directly relates to offers that may be of interest to you.
We also use other methods of automatic collection to determine information about visitors to our website, including your computer’s Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Site, pages of our Site that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Site, access times and dates, and other statistics. We use the information obtained using these tools to provide better customer service, enhance our product offerings, and detect potential misuse or fraud.
Security
Heddels works to protect the security of your information during order transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts order information you transmit. While we implement these and other security measures on our site, please note that 100% security is not always possible. You play a role in protecting your information as well. Because your password permits access to your personal information, please keep your password secret and do not disclose it to others.
