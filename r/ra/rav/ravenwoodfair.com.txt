SECURITY OF PROVIDED INFORMATION
Ravenwood Fair is very concerned with safeguarding your provided information. We use standard and commercially reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect the privacy of your data from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure. However, no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure from intrusion, and we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat our commercially reasonable efforts to ensure protection of your information or use your personal information for improper purposes.
INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER
Your information may be transferred to, and maintained on computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, Ravenwood Fair transfers personal information to the United States and processes it there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.
INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE
As part of our regular business conduct, we may share information with companies or individuals providing services or acting on our behalf, such as companies providing technological or fulfillment services. These third parties have access to your information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose. While we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy and security procedures as Ravenwood Fair, we will take all reasonable precautions under the circumstances to ensure the protection of your personal information.
We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal processes, to protect the property and rights of Ravenwood Fair or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any persons, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.

If you would like for us to delete your record in our system, please contact us and we will attempt to accommodate your request if we do not have any legal obligation to retain the record.
OPT-OUT
You may "opt out" of receiving any marketing and promotional emails from us at any time by selecting the opt-out mechanism contained in an email message or any newsletter or editing your account preferences. We treat each of our consumer offerings individually, so if you are receiving mailings from more than one area of our website, if you want to unsubscribe you must do so with respect to each such area individually.
LINKS TO OTHER SITES
From time to time, we may include links to other websites as a service to you. If you choose to visit an advertiser by clicking on a banner ad or other type of advertisement, or click on another third party link, you will be directed to that third party’s website. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to review the privacy practices of the other websites you visit, as we are not responsible for their privacy practices and cannot control their use of data.

Therefore, we work on safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft with respect to information in our possession. We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your account ID, login password, or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication. For more information about phishing, visit the Federal Trade Commission’s website.
