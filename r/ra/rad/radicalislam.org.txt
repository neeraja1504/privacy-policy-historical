Clarion Project, Inc. (“Clarion”, “us”, “we”, “our”) owns and operates https://clarionproject.org (the “Site”). This privacy policy informs the user (“you”) of the Site’s privacy policy regarding the collection, use, disclosure, retention, and protection of personal information received from users of the Site. It applies to any Clarion site or application, service or tool (collectively “Services”) where this Privacy Policy is referenced, regardless of how the user accesses or uses them, including through mobile devices. By using our Services and/or our Site, you accept and agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the User Agreement, and consent to the collection, use, disclosures, retention, and protection of personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. This is our entire Privacy Policy for the Site and it supersedes any earlier version.   You agree to it every time you use the Site.
PERSONAL INFORMATION
When you voluntarily provide it, we collect personal information in the course of interacting with the site. “Personal Information” is information that can be associated with a specific user and could be used to identify that specific user whether from that data or from that data and other information that Clarion has or is likely to have access to. We do not consider personal information to include information that has been made anonymous or aggregated so that it can no longer be used to identify a specific person, whether in combination with other information or otherwise.
You do not have to provide Personal Information to browse the Site. However, you may voluntarily send us information from the Site, including Personal Information. At the Site you are able to subscribe to an email newsletter, sign up for a course, sign up to watch video content, sign up for email, take part in reader feedback, participate in polls or surveys, ask questions, send feedback or make a donation. In so doing, you may be asked to provide Personal Information such as your name, address, e-mail address or mobile number. Contact information, such as name, email and phone number, and demographic information, such as zip code, may be gathered from our visitors from information requests or other forms.

We may use the information you give us to provide services to you, at your request, including but not limited to Clarion’s educational, networking, marketing, social, recruiting activities, donation processing, store payment processing, and for other similar business purposes. We may use it to communicate with you through periodic messages regarding services, events, and other information and notices to provide you information regarding news, political or legal developments we believe may interest you. We may use it for confirmation of donations, registrations, or other actions you take on our site, and for related customer service needs. We use information you provide about others to enable us to send them referral notices, videos you choose to share or other such services. We only use contact information to send information requested or to contact users as necessary.
In certain instances, we may share your Personal Information with third parties such as our co-promotional partners and others with whom we have marketing or other relationships who assist Clarion in carrying out the above-mentioned business functions. Clarion may also share Personal Information and other data with its service providers, which may include, contractors, consultants and vendors, to help us perform statistical analysis, send you email, newsletters, marketing material, postal mail, provide customer support, arrange for deliveries, operation of the Site technology, internal operations, marketing services, and other related services; unless you have opted-out of such sharing with these service providers.

Non-Personal Information is any information that is not Personal Information. Clarion may combine Non-Personal Information you provide through the Site with information from other users to create aggregate data. Aggregate data does not (i) contain any information that could identify you, or (ii) include your personal contact information.
