Some of the Rezidor Brand Hotels are owned and operated by independent franchisees. This Policy does not cover our franchisees' privacy practices. When you provide personal information directly to one of our franchisees, the franchisee's privacy policy will apply. Please note that we require our franchisees to have privacy policies that are consistent with our Privacy Commitment and to comply with all applicable privacy and data protection laws, though their actual privacy policies may be different from this Policy.
Our sites may include links to other websites whose privacy practices may differ from those of Rezidor. In some cases, when linking to another site you may still see our branding even though you are actually reviewing content provided by a third party. If you submit personal information while on those sites, your information is subject to their privacy policies and you should review those policies.
