Personal and Anonymous Information Collected Via Technology
To make our services more useful to you, we use technological means or tools to collect Personal Information, as well as Anonymous Information, from you. These tools collect certain standard information that your browser sends to our website, including domain names, your browser type and language, and your Internet Protocol (IP) address and access times. You expressly consent to our collection of such information by using the Ramco website. An "IP address" is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. In some cases your IP address stays the same from browser session to browser session; but if you use a consumer Internet access provider, your IP address probably varies from session to session. We track IP addresses to analyze our Web page flow.
Cookies and Web Beacons: In particular, we use, as do many other websites, "cookies" or small data files stored on your computer's hard drive, as well as "web beacons" which are images invisibly embedded on a web page, to collect information during visits to the Ramco website, including during chat sessions with Ramco personnel. The information collected includes the visitor's IP address, when the site was visited and what pages were visited. In some instances, we also use cookies to collect information in connection with future visits from that website, to recognize you as a previous visitor, or to track your activity on our site. If you follow a link to the site from an affiliate or promotion, we store information about your arrival from that affiliate or promotion in a session cookie. You do not need to have cookies turned on to visit our site. You can refuse cookies by turning them off on your browser. But, if you want to access webpages that require registration, you need to accept a mandatory session cookie, which you can delete after you leave the site. Web beacons, which record your IP address and the time of your visit and what pages you viewed, and are used by a third party service which tracks site usage for us, cannot be turned off.
Identification of Visitors to Site: We are able to identify you from the Personal Information that you submitted in the past or that you submit on a current visit. We are also able to identify you or your organization from other information obtained by technological means, such as browser you are using or the pages on the Ramco site you visit. This data is now tracked by a third party service and provided to us in aggregate form by that service.
Use of Personal Information
In general, Personal Information you provide to us or that is obtained by technological means is used to respond to requests that you make, to facilitate communication with you that you initiate or request or to provide you with information about products and services of Ramco in which you indicate an interest. For example, we may use your Personal Information to process an employment application, should you submit one to us. We also use your personal information to send you electronic newsletters and promotional e-mails if you have requested to receive such communications from us (as described below). We also use Personal Information to provide you with updates to our services and to respond to your requests.
Disclosure of Personal Information
We do not generally sell, trade, rent, or share your Personal Information with third parties. However, we may share your Personal Information with third parties to fulfill your request for products or services or to deliver newsletters or promotional e-mails. These third parties are required not to use your Personal Information other than to provide the services requested by Ramco. You expressly consent to the sharing of your Personal Information with our contractors and third party service providers for the sole purpose of providing services to you.
Future Communications and Use of Personal Information
If you opt-in to receive communications from us (as described below), we will periodically send you free newsletters and e-mails that directly promote the use of our site or our products or services, and use the contact information you provide to us to do so. If you would like to cease receiving these communications from us, you may unsubscribe by sending an email to us
Sharing Information with Affiliates
We may share some or all of your Personal Information with our subsidiaries and other affiliates, without requesting your specific consent to such internal sharing. If Ramco and/or its assets are acquired by another company, the acquiring company will possess the Personal Information collected by us and it will assume the rights to use and the obligations to protect your Personal Information as in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Use and Disclosure of Anonymous Information
Except as required by law or court order, Ramco will not disclose any of your Personal Information linked to Anonymous Information to any third party. Anonymous Information is usually only used by Ramco in aggregated, rather than in individual form, to determine and analyze such things as site usage, the popularity of pages on the site traffic patterns of site visitors and the like. Ramco may use Anonymous Information to identify your organization and contact that organization based on public information about the organization. Such identification and/or contact can be prevented by sending an email to us..
Legally Required Disclosure of Personal and Anonymous Information
We may disclose your Personal Information if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on Ramco; or (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Ramco or users of our website. To the extent required by applicable law or by subpoenas or warrants served on Ramco court orders, we reserve the right to combine Anonymous Information with Personal Information that you actively submit or other information obtained through technological means to identify you.
