Privacy Policy|1320Video.com
This privacy policy is effective as of December 1, 2014.
The following privacy policy covers all of the websites of 1320Video and its subsidiaries and affiliates websites, the Mobile Services (as defined below) or desktop application services, software, or other materials or services made available on, from, or through the websites (collectively, the “Website(s)”). This policy does not, however, apply to entities that 1320Video does not own or control, such as applications and websites using Facebook Platform. If you create a 1320Video account using Facebook or another third party social media service, or if you link your 1320Video account with any of these third party services, we may share your information with these third party services. This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected by the Website(s). Please read this policy. If you have any questions or suggestions regarding our privacy policy, please contact us.
By using the Website(s) you understand and agree that 1320Video is providing a platform for you to post content, including photos, comments and other materials (“User Submissions”) to the Website(s) and to share User Submissions publicly. This means that other users may search for, see, use, or share any of your User Submissions that you make publicly available through the Website(s), consistent with the terms and conditions of this privacy policy and 1320Video’s Terms of Use.
Collection and Use of Aggregated Information
1320Video creates aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns. These aggregated statistics are used internally to better provide services to users of the Website(s) and may also be provided to advertisers, sponsors, and partners but they contain no individual personal information and cannot be used to gather such information. This allows 1320Video’s advertisers, partners, and sponsors to advertise more effectively, and allows our users to receive advertisements that are pertinent to their needs.
Ownership of Information
1320Video is the sole owner of the information collected on the Website(s) which includes:
Your username, password and e-mail address when you register for an account on a Website.
Profile information that you provide for your user profile (e.g., first and last name, picture, phone number). This information allows 1320Video to help you or others be “found” on the Website(s).
User Submissions that you post to the Website(s).
Communications between you and 1320Video. For example, 1320Video may send you emails related to the Website(s) (e.g., account verification, changes/updates to features of the Website(s), technical and security notices). Note that you may not opt out of these e-mails.
1320Video may offer certain services that are available via a mobile device or app, including (i) the ability to upload User Submissions to the Website(s) via a mobile device, (ii) the ability to browse the Website(s) from a mobile device and (iii) the ability to access certain features through an application downloaded and installed on a mobile device (collectively, the ”Mobile Services“). If you use the Mobile Services, 1320Video may store information regarding your mobile device, including your device type and operating system, the advertising ID of your mobile device, location services (if you grant permission), or in other applications as permitted by the functionality of such mobile device. In addition, 1320Video may access, collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more “device identifiers.” Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by 1320Video. A device identifier may deliver information to 1320Video or to a third party partner about how you browse and use the Website(s) and may help 1320Video or others provide reports or personalized content and ads. Some features of the Website(s) may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.
