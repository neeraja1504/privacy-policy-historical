California Privacy Rights
Under California law, California residents who have provided personal information to a company may have the right to request a list of all third parties to whom that company had disclosed such information for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year, along with a list of the categories of personal information that had been so disclosed. However, if a company adopts and discloses a privacy policy that provides the ability to opt-out of such disclosures to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes, then the company is not required to maintain and provide such lists, and instead may provide you with information on how to exercise your right to prevent disclosure of your personal information. Because the privacy policy as disclosed on this Site provides you with an opportunity to opt-out of disclosures by us of your Personal Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes, we do not have to provide you with such lists. If you are a California resident who would like information on how to exercise your rights concerning third party disclosures, you may send an email privacy@rachaelray.com. Attn: California Privacy Rights Administrator

We may also collect your Personal Information if you post, display and or publish materials on the Site or if users send us stories, recipes, photos and/or other materials (“User Content”), and we post these materials on our Site. We also may display a child’s photo or artwork, or photos that show images of any children, but we will only show a child’s first name and age. We will not show any last names or addresses, including email or postal. We will not use material without the consent of the user. We will not return any User Content, including but not limited to materials, such as photographs, once they have been sent to us.

An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your internet service provider when you log on. RRD anonymizes the collection of IP addresses via Google Analytics (see below for more), which you can read more about here: https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052?hl=en.

This aggregate tracking information is used to help RRD improve and enhance the website experience for all of its visitors.
Your Consent
We only collect, use and/or disclose your Personal Information with your consent. We will ask for your affirmative consent when we collect your Personal Information, such as when we ask for your e-mail address or for your consent to our use of cookies, as explained below. Your consent may also be given for a particular purpose. For example, when you submit your Personal Information to us by emailing us, you are consenting to the collection, handling, use and disclosure of your Personal Information for the purposes of responding to you.

Do Not Track Signals
Certain web browsers provide users with an option by which you may have your browser send a “Do Not Track” signal to the website that you are visiting, advising the recipient website that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. However, the way browsers communicate such “Do Not Track” signals is not yet uniform and accordingly, our Site does not take any action in response to such signals. In the event a final standard is developed and accepted, we may reassess how we should respond to such signals.
Use of Your Personal Information Within RRD
In order to provide you with efficient and reliable services and to improve product and service options available to you, RRD may share your Personal Information with our affiliated entities, in which case your personal information will be collected, used, disclosed, managed and stored in accordance with this policy as set forth herein. Our affiliates are companies controlled or owned by us, or companies that control us, or are under common control with us. The Site is intended for users in the United States and its territories and possessions. If you use the Site from any country outside the United States, the various communications will necessarily result in the transfer of information across international boundaries, and by visiting the Site, you consent to these transfers as required or permitted by applicable law.
Use of Your Personal Information by Our Service Providers
From time to time, we may hire third parties to assist us with certain functions and services, such as data processing, computer software and website maintenance and development, promotional and marketing services, customer service, professional, legal or accounting services and/or business and sales analysis. RRD may share your Personal Information, without restriction (and regardless of whether you have chosen to limit our sharing of your Personal Information as collected on the Site), with such companies that we hire to perform services for us. In such situations, RRD requires that these companies agree to maintain the confidentiality of your Personal Information and to comply with the safeguards described in this Privacy Policy. These companies have access to the Personal Information needed to perform their functions but are not permitted to share or use such information for any other purposes. Furthermore, in compliance with privacy laws, we also provide our opt-out lists to non-affiliated third party companies so that communications sent by those companies on RRD’s behalf do not get sent to addresses appearing on our opt-out lists.
If RRD Changes Ownership
We may also share your Personal Information as required to allow for a change in ownership of RRD and/or any of RRD’s affiliated entities and/or of any business(es) to which the Site relates, and the related transfer of user information to the new owner. In the event of any such change of ownership, your Personal Information will continue to be protected by the terms of this Privacy Policy unless and until you are notified of a change.
Lawful Access, Legal Action and Investigations
Your Personal Information may be disclosed to non-affiliated third parties as either permitted by, or to comply with, applicable laws and regulations. Your Personal Information may be transmitted through and stored on servers outside your home country, and may be accessed by authorities in those jurisdictions.

For example, RRD may disclose your Personal Information to comply with investigations by regulatory authorities or enforcement agencies in the United States of America or elsewhere, or to protect against or prevent actual or potential fraud. Furthermore, RRD may disclose your Personal Information if it has a reasonable good faith basis to believe that it is required to do so by law, compelled by court order or legal process, or is reasonably necessary and/or appropriate to: (i) protect the rights, property and/or safety of RRD or any other person or entity; or (ii) prevent or take action concerning any alleged: (a) illegal activity or (b) breach of the Terms and Conditions or Privacy Policy of the Site.

We may also use third-party advertising companies to target and show you advertisements when you visit the Site. On occasion, RRD may permit third-party advertisers and ad networks to place their own cookies on our Site to track visitors’ activities on the Site.

This practice is called “interest-based advertising,” and the practices of these third-parties are not covered by this Privacy Policy.

If you decide you do not want to receive personalized ads from third-party advertisers and ad networks please visit www.AboutAds.info/choices, where you can learn more about opting out from receiving interest-based advertising.
