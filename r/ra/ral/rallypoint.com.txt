What Information Do We Collect?
Personal Information :  We collect the following personal information in connection with the Website:  (a) when you sign up to create a RallyPoint profile, we collect the personal information you disclose on the account registration form and your profile, including your email address, password, contact information, first name, last name, gender, birthday, branch of service, rank, military specialty, current unit and duty station, professional experience, educational background, and any other information you provide at registration or in your profile; (b) if you communicate with us by email, we will collect your email address; (c) when you visit the Website, our servers will automatically recognize your IP address; and (d) if you submit Content, you may, at your option, include information (such as your name or photograph) in the Content that can be used to identify you.  All of this information is referred to in this Policy as “Personal Information”.
Web Tracking Information : We, and our third party service providers, may use web tracking technologies such as cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and clear GIFs in order to operate the Website efficiently and to collect data related to usage of the Website and to web and email marketing conducted by us or on our behalf.  Such collected data (“Web Tracking Information”) may include the address of the websites you visited before and after you visited the Website, the type of browser you are using, your Internet Protocol (IP) address, what pages in the Website you visit and what links you clicked on, and whether you opened email communications we send to you.  In order to collect Web Tracking Information and to make your use of the Website more efficient, we may store cookies on your computer.  In addition, the third party ad networks (“Ad Networks”) that we use to display advertising to you may also store their own cookies on your computer.  We may also use web tracking technologies that are placed in web pages on the Website or in email communications to collect information about actions that users take when they interact with the Website or such email communications, and Ad Networks and RallyPoint’s Contractors (as hereinafter defined) may also do so.  We do not correlate Web Tracking Information to individual user Personal Information.  Some Web Tracking Information may include data, such as IP address data and general segment information (e.g., your unit, career field, or information about your professional or educational background, that is unique to you.  You may be able to modify your browser settings to alter which web tracking technologies are permitted when you use the Website, but this may affect the performance of the Website.
How Do We Use the Information We Collect?
We collect information when you sync non-RallyPoint content – like your email address book or mobile device contacts – with your account. We use this information to improve your experience, help connect you with military or veterans organizations which we have vetted and which we believe to have the best interest of the member in mind, and allow you and your network to be better connected. You can remove your address book and any other synced information whenever you'd like.
You may use the RallyPoint contacts importer (or other similar mechanisms provided by RallyPoint) to upload individual contacts or your entire address book into RallyPoint. RallyPoint stores this information and uses it to help you manage and leverage your contacts. We also use this information to enhance your RallyPoint experience by helping you to grow your network by: identifying your contacts already on RallyPoint; informing your contacts that you are building your RallyPoint network; providing a template to send invitations to your contacts that have not registered with RallyPoint; and suggesting people you may know but who may not be in your RallyPoint contacts. RallyPoint may also use this information to show you and other members that you share the same uploaded contacts who may or may not be members. Please note that when you send an invitation to connect to another individual (a “connection”), that person may have access to your email address or, for SMS invitations, mobile number because it may be displayed in the invitation. RallyPoint may also remind you of pending invitations. Your RallyPoint connections may also have access to your email address.
RallyPoint may make other tools available to sync information with RallyPoint, and may also develop additional features that allow members to use their RallyPoint account in conjunction with other third-party services. For example, RallyPoint mobile applications may allow you to sync your device’s calendar, email and/or contacts apps with RallyPoint.
Another example are software tools that allow you to see RallyPoint and other public social media information about the people you email or meet with and leverage RallyPoint to help you gain insights from and grow your network. If you grant these products (mobile applications or other RallyPoint services that sync external email and calendar services permission to access your email and calendar accounts, they will access and may store some of your email header and calendar history information in order to match it to RallyPoint and other public social media profiles. RallyPoint’s products that sync with external email services may also temporarily cache message content for performance reasons, in a way that is unreadable by RallyPoint and its service providers.
Any information that you upload or sync with RallyPoint is covered by the User Agreement and this Privacy Policy. You can remove your information at your convenience using the features RallyPoint makes available. You can remove your address book and any other synced information at any time by requesting this.
