Information Collected by Automated Means
We obtain certain information by automated means when you visit our website, such as through cookies, web beacons, and web server logs. The information we collect in this manner includes the IP address of the device you use to connect to the internet, unique device identifier, browser characteristics, device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, information on actions taken on our site, dates and times of website visits, and the pages accessed. By collecting this information, we learn how to best tailor our website to our visitors and understand what products and services you might prefer. Both we and others (such as our service providers) may collect personal information about our visitors’ online activities over time and across third-party websites.
Like many companies, we use “cookies” on this website. Cookies are bits of text that are placed on your computer’s hard drive when you visit certain websites. Cookies may enhance your online experience by saving your preferences while you are visiting a particular site. We use cookies, for example, to preserve the contents of your virtual shopping bag between visits. We also use cookies to measure activity on the site and determine which areas and features of the site are the most popular.
Most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new cookie, and how to disable existing cookies. Without cookies, however, you may not be able to take full advantage of all our site features. For example, if you turn off certain cookies or refuse them, you will not be able to make purchases on the site. Our website is not designed to respond to “do not track” signals received from browsers.
Certain pages on this website and emails we sent you contain “web beacons” (also known as internet tags, pixel tags, and clear GIFs). Web beacons are used, for example, to obtain the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the beacon appears, the time the page containing the beacon was viewed, and the type of browser used to view the page. We also retain service providers who use web beacons to assess the effectiveness of our email communications and learn what pages our visitors viewed.
We use information collected through these automated means for purposes such as (i) customizing our users’ visits to our website, (ii) delivering content and advertisements tailored to our users’ interests and the manner in which our users browse our sites, and (iii) managing our sites and other aspects of our business. To the extent required by applicable law, we will obtain your consent before collecting information using cookies or similar automated means.
We also may use third-party web analytics services, such as those of Adobe Analytics and Google Analytics, to measure the effectiveness of our advertising and determine how visitors use this website. These service providers’ tools, including cookies and web beacons, allow us to collect information such as the state and ZIP code from which our visitors come and the IP addresses of our visitors’ computers. To learn about data collected by Adobe Analytics and Google Analytics and your choices with respect to these services, please click here and here.
Interest-Based Advertising
We may collect information about your online activities on our website to provide you with advertising about products and services tailored to your individual interests. We also may obtain information for this purpose from third-party websites and apps on which our ads are served. This section of our Privacy Notice provides details and explains how to exercise your choices.
You may see certain ads on other websites and apps because we work with advertising partners (including advertising networks) to engage in remarketing and retargeting activities. Our advertising partners allow us to target our messaging to users through demographic, interest-based, and contextual means. These partners track your online activities over time and across websites and apps by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of third-party cookies, web server logs, and web beacons. They use this information to show you advertisements that may be tailored to your individual interests. The information our advertising partners may collect includes data about your visits to websites and apps that participate in the relevant advertising networks, such as the pages or advertisements you view and the actions you take on the websites or apps. This data collection takes place both on our website and on third-party websites and apps that participate in the ad networks. This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. For example, we utilize Netmining’s targeted advertising services to show you our ads on other websites based on your prior visits to our site and other online activity. You can opt out of this feature by clicking here.

This Privacy Notice does not govern the collection or use of the information you provide in connection with your credit card application.
Other Ways We Collect Personal Information
In-Store Wi-Fi Data Collection
In certain Stores, we use a service that analyzes Wi-Fi signals from mobile devices to measure Store occupancy and to identify customer traffic patterns in the Store. The service determines the location of a smartphone or wireless device by observing Wi-Fi or Bluetooth signals that are broadcast from that device. Individual devices are identified by device identifiers. For the service to collect information from your device, the device’s Wi-Fi must be turned on while you are in the Store. If your device’s Wi-Fi function is enabled, you will receive a pop-up message that asks whether you agree to allow your device’s Wi-Fi data to be collected while you are connected to the in-Store Wi-Fi network. The service provider that collects information from mobile devices in our Stores hashes the device identifiers before using them for analysis purposes. The service provider’s reports to us contain only aggregated statistics about visitors to the Store. If you change your mind after agreeing to allow your device’s Wi-Fi data to be collected, you can opt out by turning off your device’s Wi-Fi function or by clicking here.
QR Codes
We use QR codes in connection with certain promotions, contests, and special events. If you scan our QR code, you will get an invitation on your mobile device to join our mailing list. To sign up, we ask you for information such as your name, mailing address, email address, telephone numbers, and age. We use the information to communicate with you about our products, services, and promotions.
Customer Assistance
You may call our Customer Assistance line for information about our products or personal shopping advice. If you do so, we may ask you for information such as your name, email address, postal address, telephone number, and, if you choose to make a purchase, your payment card information. We use this information to respond to your request and process your transaction.
