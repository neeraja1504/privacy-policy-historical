Fraud Reporting
DON’T GET SCAMMED
Report suspicious emails, text messages and web pages
Your privacy is very important to us. Unfortunately, fraudulent emails, text messages, and webpages are becoming more common and sophisticated, so we’re adding even more safeguards to protect our customers.
If you receive a suspicious email or text message and aren’t sure if it is from Raley’s, Bel-Air, or Nob Hill Foods, it probably isn’t.
DO NOT open attachments, click on links, or respond to emails or text messages if you suspect the email or text message is fake or fraudulent. Instead, please forward the suspicious email to us or send us a new email with a copy of the suspicious text message at reportphishing@raleys.com.
If you see a webpage claiming to be ours that seems fake, please copy the link and email it to us at reportphishing@raleys.com.
We will investigate and report back to you to if the email, text message or webpage was actually sent or hosted by us.
LOOK FOR THESE CLUES
How to spot a phony email, text message, or webpage
If the sender’s email address does not include the raleys.com domain name, instead of using another domain, it’s not from us. Example: raleys@comcast.net.
If the email includes an urgent call to action such as, “For your protection and for security reasons,” or asks you to update your information via a link or button, report the email as it’s likely a scam.
If an email contains a webpage URL that looks like it leads to the Raley’s website, the email might actually be linked to a non-Raley’s webpage, which might be a spoof website. Hover over the link to reveal the real URL and if it’s not from the domain raleys.com, report it.
Fraudulent text messages often use similar techniques as fraudulent emails and typically convey a sense of urgency to secure your account and using words like “limited,” “locked,” or “deactivated” to describe your account status. These text messages may prompt you to call a specific phone number, visit a link, or respond directly with personal or account information.
If the text message originates from a suspicious sender or includes an unprompted request for personal information, report the text message as it’s likely a scam.
If you click on a link, open an attachment, or otherwise respond to a suspicious email, text message, or webpage, or if you have any other security concerns or questions about your account, please contact us immediately.
