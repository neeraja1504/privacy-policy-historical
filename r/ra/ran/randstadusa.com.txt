overview
The primary purposes of the Randstad website are:
to provide employers who are existing or prospective clients of Randstad with an online tool and resources to post job openings and orders and with other relevant information; and
to provide professionals who are seeking jobs with an online tool and resources to assess and evaluate available opportunities that may match their qualifications and preferences and to submit their resumes and other relevant information to apply for such positions.
As a result of its purposes, use of this website facilitates and inherently involves the collection and exchange of valuable and sensitive information among employers, job seekers and Randstad. This Privacy Policy covers the collection, use, sharing, retention, care and disposal of personal information by or on behalf of Randstad of or relating to:
anonymous visitors to the Randstad website,
persons who register as employers on the Randstad website,
persons who register as job seekers on the Randstad website, and
other individuals who may supply personal information to Randstad from time to time.
By using this website, such persons expressly consent to this Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy applies only to the Randstad website. Websites or online services provided by third parties accessible by a link on the Randstad website and users of this website who enter into any online communication or transaction with each other, such as a job seeker and employer, may have their own distinct privacy policy. Users assume responsibility for informing themselves of the privacy policies of such third parties and other users and making any user choices, including refraining from communicating with such third parties or other users whose privacy policy they do not accept.
Randstad reserves the right to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will only be effective prospectively, from the time such changes are published on the website and, with respect to any particular information of or relating to any person, Randstad will comply with this Privacy Policy as in effect at the time such information was supplied or obtained unless it obtains consent for the application of any other or different terms to such information.
information collection
Randstad collects information from and regarding individuals in a variety of ways from a variety of sources. Randstad initially collects information from users of its website during their visits to the website. We may also collect information externally from this website, such as information regarding those job seekers who secure employment with or through Randstad and those employers who are or become clients of Randstad. This information enables us to profile the interests of employers and job seekers, post and solicit applications for job openings and orders and track the status of pending openings.
We sometimes afford job seekers and employers an opportunity to provide us with specific additional information when they enroll on this website and complete their profile, such as their physical geographical location. Providing this information is optional. However, providing this information helps us better serve job seekers, employers and other website visitors by including their preferences and choices on various options.
Randstad also collects and uses information by installing small computer files (known as cookies) on the hard drive of each computer used to visit our website. A cookie is a string of information sent by a website and stored on your hard drive or temporarily in your computer's memory. Cookies are an important element of your experience on our website. They allow us to welcome you each time you visit and customize our information to your past website experiences. Cookies also help us detect and stop fraud.
The website may include first-party cookies (i.e., cookies that send data directly to Randstad and agents and contractors acting on behalf of Randstad, used to monitor, analyze and administer the website) and third-party cookies (i.e., cookies that send data to our contractors for their commercial use). The cookies on our website may also track Internet activities across different websites.
Some computer browsers permit you to disable or uninstall cookies, and you may do so by following the instructions provided by your hardware and software vendors. Randstad does not provide the means for you to opt out of having cookies placed on your computer, and makes no representation or warranty that the disabling devices provided by your hardware and software vendors will be effective to block or remove the cookies.

The website does not accept or process such Do Not Track signals or similar mechanisms.
information use
Randstad uses each registered job seeker's personal information to administer the various services opted for by the job seeker and to make the job seeker aware of career opportunities and other developments from time to time. Personal data is information which can be used to identify you, such as name, date of birth, identification number or other factors specific to your
identity
, such as address, telephone, email or cell/mobile number.
The user information that Randstad collects may be added to our databases and used for business purposes, including for marketing and promotional purposes, for a statistical analysis of users’ behavior, for product development, for content improvement, or to customize the content and layout of the website.

email

Among other uses, Randstad uses the information to identify an individual as a registered job seeker, to present potential employment opportunities to the job seeker, to present the job seeker to potential employers and to report these transactions to the relevant job seeker. We also give each job seeker the option to receive certain targeted communications from time to time.
information sharing
With the job seeker's permission, Randstad may submit the job seeker's resume, application and/or other information to a prospective employer on the basis that such prospective employer will not disclose the fact that such job seeker is seeking employment or communicate with any other person regarding the contents of such job seeker's resume or application except with the job seeker's consent or otherwise in compliance with applicable labor and employment laws.
Randstad may also from time to time submit the job seeker's profile, with sufficient information removed so that the job seeker is not readily personally identifiable, to prospective employers to solicit their potential interest in him or her as a job candidate.
Randstad may share a job seeker's personal information with entities with whom it contracts to assist in administering the website, including the job board on the website, from time to time. We may also share user information with third party companies and individuals with whom we contract in connection with the following: to facilitate the website; to provide the website or portions of the website on our behalf; to perform related services, including without limitation, maintenance services, database management, fulfillment, web analytics and improvement of the features or functionality of the website.
Randstad may also share a job seeker's personal information with business partners to offer you goods, services and other incentives relating to the website and the job board. Once we establish and maintain an employment, staffing or placement relationship with you, we use the data you provided to us to comply with laws and regulations, including but not limited to employment law, tax and social security and national and international sanctions regulation compliance. For the purposes mentioned above, Randstad may transfer your personal data to other Randstad entities that provide services on behalf of Randstad.
We may also share your information with any successor or assign some or all of the relevant part of our business, whether through a sale of our business, merger or otherwise.
We may share user information with appropriate third parties when we believe, in our sole discretion, that such sharing is appropriate: to comply with the law, including but not limited to, in response to a subpoena served on Randstad; to enforce or apply this Privacy Policy or other applicable terms, rules or policies; to protect the rights, property or safety of Randstad, our users or others; or to prevent activity that we believe, in our sole discretion, may be or may become illegal, unethical or legally actionable (including exchanging user information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection).
In all cases in which we share a job seeker's personal information, we will seek contractual commitments from the party with whom we share such information to abide by the same terms and conditions as those applicable to us in this Privacy Policy regarding the use, sharing, retention, care and disposal of such information.
