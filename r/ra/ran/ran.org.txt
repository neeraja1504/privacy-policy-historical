Privacy Policy - Rainforest Action Network
February 12th, 2019
Rainforest Action Network (RAN) is committed to maintaining the privacy of those who visit our websites, www.ran.org, act.ran.org, grants.ran.org, japan.ran.org, and forestsandfinance.org.
RAN is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. This information will not be sold or rented to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. RAN collects information from site visitors at several different points on this website.
We collect only the domain name, but not the e-mail address, of visitors to our website, aggregate information on what pages visitors access, and information volunteered by the visitor (such as survey information, e-mail and other addresses and other personal information).
The information we collect is used to improve the content of our website, to notify visitors about updates to our website, and alert visitors about issues and opportunities. The information is not shared with other organizations for commercial purposes.
All personal information is stored on secure servers with password protection. Our service providers have privacy policies that also ensure they do not share, sell or rent your information for commercial purposes and that they use appropriate security procedures to protect your data. (NationBuilder – https://nationbuilder.com/privacy, Blackbaud – https://www.blackbaud.com/company/privacy-policy/north-america) Visitors under the age of 13 (US) or 16 (EU & elsewhere), please ask your parent/guardian for their consent before submitting your personal information to this site. If we have reason to believe that someone is underage and we have collected their personal information without proper consent, we will delete that information in a reasonable period of time.
Financial Transactions
To process a charitable contribution or product purchase, it is necessary for Rainforest Action Network to gather the donor’s name, email address, mailing address, phone, and credit card information. This data is used to verify identity and execute the financial transaction. Additionally, phone number and email address information may be used to contact visitors if there is a problem with the transaction.
RAN may use service providers (such as merchant banks and ecommerce integrators) for the express purpose of conducting financial transactions. It is important to note that credit card numbers are used only at the time of the transaction, and are not stored following the conclusion of the transaction unless a transaction is selected that occurs on a regular basis. For transactions that recur, credit card information is stored in an encrypted format.
Donations to Rainforest Action Network are refundable within 30 days upon written request. If you would like to have your donation refunded, please contact RAN’s Development Department by writing to membership@ran.org.

Electronic Newsletter

This information is stored securely with a third-party service provider (our agent) for the sole use of RAN.
