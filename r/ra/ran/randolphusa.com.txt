We work with Authorize.net, a payment processor, to ensure secure and efficient processing of your customer data. Authorize.net uses a secure, encrypted server, and ensures that all supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted on Authorize.net’s servers.  We do not receive or have access to your credit card number – that information is maintained only by Authorize.net.  The information on Authorize.net, is only accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, who are required to keep the information confidential. For more information on Authorize.net’s security and privacy policy, please click here:  https://www.authorize.net/about-us/privacy/

Where Randolph has given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of the Website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. We urge you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of the Website, like message boards. The information you share in public areas may be viewed by any user of the Website.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although Randolph does its best to protect your personal information, it cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to the Website. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk.

Your User Contributions are posted on and transmitted to others at your own risk.  Please be aware that Randolph cannot control the actions of other users of the Website with whom you may choose to share your User Contributions.
