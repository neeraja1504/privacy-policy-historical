Is My Personal Information Secure?

You need to prevent unauthorized access to your account by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account. Boomerang endeavors to ensure that Personal Information is kept secure. However, Boomerang cannot guarantee the security of this information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of user information at any time.
How Can I Change or Remove Information on Boomerang?
Your Settings page on Boomerang allows you to change Personal Information. In addition, Facebook provides privacy settings that allow you to restrict Boomerang’s access to your data. You can also unlink Boomerang from your Facebook altogether, meaning that no new data from Facebook will be accessed going forward and existing data may be removed.
