What information do we collect when you browse our Site?
We collect information that you submit to us (such as your name, posting address or email address and other information from which your identity is discernible) when you use our Site. We also use "cookies" on the Site. A cookie is a small amount of data sent to your computer from the computers used by a website.

How do we use that information?
We will use your personal information for the purpose for which you provided it (e.g. sending email newsletters). We may also send your information to other people (including people based outside of the India which may have less strict rules about processing your information) if that is a necessary part of the reason for which you sent it to us (e.g. asking a company to provide a quotation, or to distribute your CV), or if we believe the law requires it. We may aggregate your personal information with other data (so that you cannot be identified) and use that aggregated data for administrative purposes and/or share it with other people. We would like to use your personal information you supply to us to:
