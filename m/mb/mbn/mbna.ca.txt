This will not limit information we may provide to you in statements or when you contact us.

Internet Privacy Practices
Top
Web Site Privacy
The MBNA Web servers automatically recognize and record the domain name from which you access the Internet, the corresponding Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, and the names of the pages you visit while at an MBNA Web site. This information is not personally identifiable and is used to improve the content of MBNA Web sites and make them more useful. The MBNA Web servers do not collect e-mail address(es) without your consent. MBNA may ask you to provide us with your e-mail address at several points, including on applications, in correspondence or communications with you, and when you register for online banking services where it is required for us to provide the service.
Use of Your E-mail Address
Currently, we do not share any e-mail address you provide to us with our endorsing organizations or other companies to market their products or services. We use both MBNA servers and servers of other companies (“service providers”) to deliver and report on the progress of e-mail programs and to maintain, service and fulfill products and services. When MBNA uses a service provider, we prohibit them from using your e-mail address for any other purpose.
With your consent, we may periodically send you marketing offers at the e-mail address(es) you provide, that may be of interest to you. With each such marketing e-mail message you will have the opportunity to opt-out of receiving future marketing offers at that e-mail address. If you are an account holder, we reserve the right to use the e-mail address(es) you provide to present you with information about your account. This may include, but is not limited to, activating your account(s), account past due notices, rates available for cash and balance transfers, adding an authorized user, and any online banking services.
We will track the activity of an e-mail (for example, were graphics viewed, was the e-mail opened, were links in the e-mail clicked), to allow us to measure the effectiveness of the e-mail, to provide future offers, and for fulfillment of products and services. Additionally, for your convenience, we may pre-fill online forms with your e-mail address.
Internet Security
MBNA will not disclose or request sensitive information in an unencrypted e-mail (for example, full account number, social insurance number, personal identification number (PIN), or security passwords). If you receive an e-mail purportedly from MBNA containing or asking for this type of sensitive information, prior to responding, please contact MBNA Customer Satisfaction at 1-800-404-1319.
MBNA uses encryption technology to protect certain information sent over the Internet. SSL is an encryption technology known as “Secure Sockets Layer”. SSL encrypts transmissions between two parties and verifies the Web site server with which you are communicating. An “s” after the “http” in a Web site’s address indicates that you are attached to a secure server using SSL technology. Additionally, if your browser is Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0, Netscape Navigator 4.0, or a higher version of either, a picture of a lock or a key should appear in the lower right hand corner of the browser’s window.
Use of Cookies
Some MBNA Web sites may use a feature of your Internet browser called a cookie. Cookies are files placed within your browser on your computer’s hard drive by a Web site server. MBNA Web sites may use cookies to facilitate your Internet sessions, to maintain security, and to improve our Web sites. For example, MBNA may use cookies to verify your identity, remember your personal settings such as your offer preferences, and to monitor your use of MBNA Web sites to improve our services. We do not use cookies to collect data from your hard drive including your e-mail address or other personal information. If you choose not to enable cookies on your browser, you may not be able to use some of the services offered on MBNA’s Web sites.
Advertising Services
MBNA uses third party companies to serve ads on our Web site and other Web sites. These companies help MBNA execute, optimize, and measure the effectiveness of our online banner advertising programs. These companies use cookies and a unique code to measure advertising effectiveness and to provide ads about goods and services that may interest you.
MBNA’s banner advertisements and online applications may contain small graphics with tags in them. These tags are not personally identifiable and work in conjunction with the cookies. They allow us to determine if the ad was viewed or responded to and help us to measure the effectiveness of our advertising.
To Further Protect Your Privacy
While exploring the services offered through MBNA’s Web sites, please be aware that other online retailers, partners, third party Internet sites, and third party services accessible through MBNA’s Web sites, have separate privacy and data collection policies and practices, which are independent of and may be different from MBNA’s policies and practices. MBNA is not responsible or liable for these independent policies and practices and it is your responsibility to review them and decide whether or not they satisfactorily protect your rights.
We may amend these Internet Privacy Practices at any time, and when such a change is made we will post a revised version on this MBNA Web site. Changes will be effective when they are posted. It is your responsibility to review these Internet Privacy Practices from time to time to be aware of any such changes. Your continued use of this MBNA Web site indicates your agreement to any such changes.
