Privacy Policy
OUR COMMITMENT TO PRIVACY
ZFERRAL, INC (“Ambassador”) is committed to protecting your privacy and will make reasonable efforts to provide you a safe and secure user experience. We aim to make our privacy policy easy to read so you that you understand our online data collection practices and usage policies for www.getAmbassador.com (the “Site” and any “Services”). Please note that your use of the Site and any of our Services is subject to our Terms of Service which you may access at the bottom of our homepage. Our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service are integral to your use of our Site, therefore you must agree to both agreements before using our Site or any of our Services.
SCOPE OF THE PRIVACY POLICY
The Privacy Policy applies to all information you provide to Ambassador through the Site. If you have submitted information to any third parties through our Site and Service, we cannot be responsible for any information collected by those third parties.
WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT
We generally collect two types of information—personally identifiable information (“PII”) and non-personally identifiable information (“Non-PII”). PII is any information that can be used to specifically identify you as an individual. For example, you may submit and we may collect your name, email address, address, phone number, or similar information through the Site. Non-PII consists of information that does not specifically identify you. The following sections describe how we collect and use your PII and Non-PII.
HOW WE COLLECT YOUR INFORMATION
Cookies and Beacons
Like all websites, we use cookies and other technologies, including web beacons, so that we can enhance your user experience. Web beacons and cookies collect information such as URLs you came from and go to, your browser and OS information, your IP address, your mobile provider, your mobile device, and your ISP. None of the information collected by our cookies or web beacons is PII.
Cookies are bits of data placed on your hard drive when you visit websites. A cookie file contains information that can identify you anonymously and maintain your account's privacy. We use cookies to maintain your identity between sessions so that the Site can be personalized based on your preferences or history. We may also use cookies to track information about which pages you visit within the Site to help us gauge the effectiveness of the Site or our content. We may also store other information such as recent searches in your session. We use cookies to tell us, for example, whether you have visited us before or if you are a new visitor, and to help us understand what areas of the Site are of greatest interest to you. Cookies also may enhance your online experience by saving your preferences and password so you do not have to re-enter this information each time you visit the Site. Please be aware that some or all of our cookies may be accessible by third parties.
Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can configure your browser to stop accepting new cookies, to notify you when you a new cookie is received, and to disable existing cookies. If you choose to disable cookies in your browser, however, you may be unable to take full advantage of all the Site’s features.
Log Files

THIRD PARTY CONTRACTORS AND OTHER USES
We may use third party suppliers and service providers to facilitate our services, and they may have access to your PII. For example, we may outsource one or more aspects of our Site to a supplier or service provider who performs services according to our requirements. Although we endeavor to select only reputable companies who share our commitment to privacy and will restrict how these suppliers or service providers may use or disclose the PII to which they have access, we are in no way responsible for such third parties or their activities. Therefore, you agree to allow us to give your information to third party suppliers and service providers in order for us to provide service to you. For purposes of transparency, the following is a non-exhaustive list of other entities that we may store, share, or transfer your information with:
Adwords Intercom.io Mixpanel FullContact Salesforce MailChimp Chargify PayPal Dwolla Authorize.net
Due to factors beyond our control, we cannot fully ensure that your information will not be disclosed to third parties. For example, third parties may circumvent our security measures to unlawfully intercept or access your information.
Search Engines and Web Crawlers
Certain PII that you provide through the registration process (such as name, location, and profile image) may be accessible and made public through syndication programs, search engines, crawlers, and other similar programs.
Required Disclosures
We make every reasonable effort to preserve your privacy, but may need to disclose your PII when required by law or if we have a belief that such action is necessary to:
enforce the Privacy Policy or the Terms of Use; comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process; or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Ambassador, its members, or others.
You authorize us to disclose any information about you to law enforcement or government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe is necessary or appropriate, in connection with any investigation of illegal activity or that may expose us to liability.

In the event of a change of control of Ambassador from, for example, a sale to, or merger with, another entity, or upon Ambassador’s filing for a bankruptcy, information Ambassador receives from you is a Ambassador asset that may be transferred.
CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS
Ambassador permits residents of the State of California to use its Service, and complies with the California Business and Professions Code §§ 22575-22579.
