Privacy Policy:
Holland & Knight LLP
Welcome to hklaw.com, the Web site for Holland & Knight LLP ("H&K"). We are committed to
maintaining the privacy of information that you might share with us while visiting our site and
interacting with us online. This privacy policy and agreement (the "Privacy Policy" or "Policy")
covers how we collect, use, and treat personal information that you may provide through the
hklaw.com Web site (the "Web site" or the "Site") or while participating in exchanges via our
Extranet Sites.
The terms “you” and “your” refer to any visitor to the Web site, including (i) casual visitors to our
Site, who wish to learn more about our services ("Site Visitors"); (ii) clients and others who
choose to subscribe to our publications, and to receive announcements and other information
from our Site ("Information Recipients"); and (iii) clients of H&K, co-counsel, and others for
whom we have created, and granted access to, password-protected extranet sites ("Extranet
Users"). The terms “we” and “us” refer to Holland & Knight LLP, and the term "hklaw.com"
refers to our Web site. For your convenience, Section 17 provides a full set of definitions used
in this Privacy Policy.
1.       Your Consent
Please read this Privacy Policy carefully; when you consent to this Policy's terms, it creates
legal obligations on you and on H&K. We ask you to show your consent to the terms of this
Privacy Policy in different ways, depending on your relationship to the Site. The procedures for
consenting to this Policy are (a) less formal if you are a casual Site Visitor, and (b) more formal
if you are seeking to become an Information Recipient or an Extranet User.
1.1.     Consent by Site Visitors. By accessing and using our Web site as a Site
Visitor, you are acknowledging that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy
and agree to be legally bound by it. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy
Policy, please refrain from using our Site.
1.2.     Consent by Information Recipients. If you register to become an Information
Recipient via our Web site, you will be prompted to click an "I Accept" button linked to
this Policy during the registration process. Clicking "I Accept" further confirms your
agreement to be bound by this Privacy Policy.
1.3.     Consent by Extranet Users. If you register to obtain access to an Extranet Site
we have made available to you, you will similarly be prompted to click an "I Accept"
button linked to this Policy during the registration process. Clicking "I Accept" further
confirms your agreement to be bound by this Privacy Policy.
1.4.     Connection to Our Web site Terms. Clicking the "I Accept" button will also
confirm your agreement to comply our Web site Terms, including our "Code of Conduct,"
as further specified during the registration process.
2.       Components Of Our hklaw.com Web site
1
Our Web site is divided into two broad areas and feature-sets: (i) those areas and features that
are accessible to all Users (the "General Site"); and (ii) those areas and features that are
password-protected, and that are designed to be available only to our Extranet Users (the
"Extranet Sites"), as further described below:
2.1.      Our General Site. Our General Site is designed to provide Users with a range of
information concerning (i) the services we offer; (ii) our attorneys and their experience;
(iii) the geographic and legal subject matter areas in which we practice; (iv) employment
opportunities; and (v) other materials concerning our firm. On our General Site, for
example, Users can request newsletters, and other updates from our various practice
groups. Our General Site is also designed to provide a gateway to the Extranet Sites
that we set up for specific projects.
2.2.      Our Extranet Sites. Our Extranet Sites are designed to provide a range of
features, tailored to the particular H&K-Extranet User relationship. For example, in a
litigation matter, we may set up an Extranet Site to provide a convenient method to
share with our client (and potentially with co-counsel) case developments; scheduling
events (such as hearing dates, depositions dates, and discovery deadlines) and
information and work product. In a transaction, we may set up an Extranet Site to post
due diligence materials, and other information to assist the H&K and client teams in
working together. There are a range of other uses for Extranet Sites, that we develop
and implement with our clients on a case-by-case basis.
3.      The Relationship Between This Policy And Applicable Ethics Rules
We have taken efforts to harmonize this Privacy Policy with ethics rules, and other rules that
apply to our legal practice ("Ethics Rules"). If a circumstance arises where applicable Ethics
Rules conflict with this Privacy Policy, then applicable Ethics Rules will govern our relationship,
and not the conflicting portion of this Privacy Policy.
4.      The Types Of Information You May Provide
Information you may provide while visiting our Site or while participating as an Information
Recipient or Extranet User falls into three broad categories: (i) Personal Information; (ii)
information concerning the matter that is the subject of the Extranet Site; and (iii) aggregate
information. We use the term “Personal Information” to mean any information you provide to
us over the Site that could reasonably be used to identify you, including your name, address, e-
mail address, birth date, telephone number or any combination of such information that could be
used to identify you. We use the term "Extranet Information" to refer to information you may
provide in connection with your authorized use of an Extranet Site. “Anonymous Information”
is information that does not identify you, and may include statistical information concerning, for
example, the pages on our Site that users visit most frequently.
5.      Our Uses Of The Information You Provide
We use Information you provide to us via the Web site only as provided in this Policy. First, we
use the Personal Information you provide via the Web site only for purposes of providing you
information concerning H&K and for otherwise responding to requests you may make, as
permitted by our Web site. We do not share your Personal Information with any third parties
(except as provided in Section 9 (Disclosures to Third Parties)). Second, we use the Extranet
Information you provide only for purposes of providing the H&K services that are the subject of
2
the associated Extranet Site (again, except as provided in Section 9 (Disclosures to Third
Parties)).
Specifically, we collect, or receive, information from Site Visitors, Information Recipients, and
Extranet Users at different points on our Web site, and use this information as follows:
5.1.     Registration Information. In order to become an Information Recipient or an
Extranet User on our Site, we require that you complete a registration form. This form
asks for contact information, which includes such items as (i) name; (ii) mailing address;
and (iii) e-mail address. We use this information to provide our Information Recipients
with materials, as outlined below. For Extranet Users, we use the information to provide
a password, and in part to authenticate the User as part of the process of providing
access to an Extranet Site.
5.2.     E-mail Addresses. We use your e-mail address to send newsletters,
announcements concerning H&K or legal developments, notifications, and other
information relating to our Site. In addition, we may use your e-mail address to invite
you to presentations, or other functions we believe may be of interest to you. You will
have the ability to opt out of receiving these materials, as provided in Section 10
(Changing or Removing Information; Opting Out).
5.3.     Informational Notices and Bulletins. Periodically, we may choose to send
news, bulletins, or other information to Users, and will use Personal Information to send
such communications. If we choose to undertake such communications, you will have
the ability to opt out of receiving these communications as provided in Section 10
(Changing or Removing Information; Opting Out).
5.4.     Surveys. Periodically, we may initiate surveys at hklaw.com, and we may
request Personal Information from you in connection with such surveys. You are free to
choose whether you participate in this type of survey. The information we request may
include contact information (such as name and e-mail address). Survey information will
be used for purposes of monitoring or improving, and services we provide. We will notify
you of relevant details in connection with asking for you participation in such surveys.
5.5.     Extranet Exchanges. Where you provide us with Extranet Information, we use
that Information only for purposes of fulfilling the services called for by the associated
Extranet Site, and we do not share this Extranet Information with third parties (unless the
Extranet Site provides for such sharing, or unless you consent). Where exchanges over
an Extranet Site constitute attorney-client communications or attorney work product, we
hold such information in confidence in accordance with applicable Ethics Rules.
6.      Anonymous, Aggregate Information.
We use Anonymous Information to analyze the effectiveness of our Site, and for other similar
purposes. In addition, from time to time, we may undertake or commission statistical and other
summary analyses of the general behavior and characteristics of Users of the Site, and may
share Anonymous Information with third parties for this purpose. Rest assured, though, that
Anonymous Information provided to third parties will not allow anyone to identify you, or
determine anything personal about you. We may collect Anonymous Information through
features of the software that supports our Site, through cookies, and through other means
described below.

6.1.    IP Addresses; Logs. We may automatically receive and record information in
our server logs from your browser, including your IP address (the Internet address of
your PC), your computer's name, the type and version of your Web browser, referrer
addresses, where the computer is routing from, and other generally-accepted log
information. We may also record page views (hit counts) and other general statistical
and tracking information, which will be aggregated with that of other users in order to
understand how our Web site is being used, and for security and monitoring purposes.
6.2.    Cookies. A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an
anonymous unique identifier, which is sent to your browser from a Web site's computers
and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies can be used to provide you with a
tailored user experience and to make it easier for you to use a Web site upon a future
visit. We may include cookies on our Web site and use them to recognize you when you
return to our Web site. You may set your browser so that it does not accept cookies.
Cookies must be enabled on your web browser, however, if you wish to access certain
personalized features of our Services.
6.3.    Tags. We may use so-called "pixel tags," which are small graphic images (also
know as "Web beacons", "single-pixel GIFS", or "Web bugs"),to tell us what parts of our
Web site have been visited, to measure the effectiveness of searches customers
perform on our Site, and for other purposes. Pixel tags also enable us to send e-mail
messages in a format Users can read, and they inform us whether e-mails have been
opened, to help ensure that our messages are of interest to our Information Recipients
and others. None of this data includes Personal Information, and you can "opt-out" of
receiving these types of e-mails from us by following the directions provided in Section
10 (Changing or Removing Information; Opting Out). If any Personal Information is
collected using such tools, it will be subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy.
6.4.    Click-Throughs. We may send e-mail messages which use a “click-through
URL” linked to content on our Web site. When you click one of these URLs, you pass
through our Web server before arriving at the destination web page. We track this click-
through data to help determine Users' interest in particular topics and measure the
effectiveness of our customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked simply do
not click text or graphic links in the e-mail, or notify us in accordance with Section 10
(Changing or Removing Information; Opting Out).
Any Information Linked With Your Personal Information Is Protected As “Personal
Information”
To enable us to better understand the characteristics of our Users and to provide information
tailored to your needs, we may link (a) the Personal Information you have provided with (b)
Anonymous Information. If we combine or link any Anonymous Information or other information
with your Personal Information, the resulting combination will be treated and protected as
Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.
The Relationship Between Information You Provide At Our Site, And Information
From Offline Sources
This Privacy Policy applies to information that you provide through using our Web site. This
Privacy Policy does not apply to information you provide to H&K through other means.

As an exception to the policies set out in Section 5 (Our Uses of the Information You Provide),
we will disclose your Personal Information to third parties without your express consent in the
following circumstances:
9.1.     Site Vendors. We may employ other companies to perform functions on our
behalf, such as maintaining the Web site, providing services related to the Site,
collecting information, responding to and sending electronic mail, or other functions
necessary to our business. In order to obtain these services, we may need to share your
Personal Information with these companies (collectively, "Site Vendors"). We will
provide Site Vendors with only that information necessary to perform their duties with
respect to our Web site, and we do not allow them to use your Personal Information for
any other purpose.

case-by-case basis in order to comply with applicable Ethics Rules.

parties in addition to H&K and you (collectively, "Additional Extranet Users"). If you
disclose information to Additional Extranet Users, this Policy does not cover the uses to
which those Users may put the information, and H&K is not responsible for such Users'
conduct. You should check the Privacy Policies of these Additional Extranet Users, or
otherwise assure yourself that they provide the desired level of protection to your
Personal and other Information, before making a disclosure.
Changing or Removing Information; Opting Out.

Personal Information, you can access your account (after supplying your user name and
password) to change your password, or to correct your e-mail address for errors.

provide you with the ability to decline -- or “opt-out of” – receiving such communications.

5channels, such as public databases. Therefore, if we remove information from our Web
site databases in accordance with Section 10.3 (Deleting Information Provided Via This
Web site), this will not remove Non-Web site Information from our databases. We will
