Privacy Policy - Malta Gaming Authority
The MGA is the regulatory body responsible for the governance and supervision of all gaming activities in and from Malta. It is assigned with the responsibility and official authority to ensure that Malta’s gaming regime is based on fair, responsible, safe and secure provision of gaming services and it seeks to ensure that the three main pillars of gaming, namely (i) the fairness of games, (ii) the protection of minors and vulnerable persons and (iii) the prevention of crime, fraud and money laundering, are safeguarded as much as possible.
It is therefore the duty and responsibility of the Authority to process all the data and information as may be required to effectively safeguard the public interest with regards to gaming activities in and from Malta.
When determining the purposes and means of the processing of such personal data, the MGA – whose principal place of business is situated at Building SCM 02-03, Level 4, SmartCity Malta, Ricasoli SCM1001, Malta – is acting as the ‘Data Controller’ for the purposes of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
This Privacy Policy aims at giving an overview to data subjects of how the MGA deals with issues related to data protection and at informing data subjects of their rights pursuant to the GDPR. It also provides all the necessary information needed by Data Subjects to be able to request further information on issues related to data protection and privacy as may be required.

It is important to note that the rights of data subjects are tied with certain conditions and limitations that are stipulated within the GDPR itself.

We may also refuse to act upon requests that are deemed to be manifestly unfounded or excessive.
