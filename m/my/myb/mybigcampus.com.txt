My Big Campus Privacy Policy – My Big Campus
The following privacy policy applies to personal data collected at www.lightspeedsystems.com , www.mybigcampus.com , or www.mybigcampus.co.uk . Lightspeed Systems Inc. and its affiliates (collectively "Lightspeed Systems") are committed to the security and protecting the privacy of its users. Because Lightspeed Systems gathers certain types of information about the users of the Services, we believe you should fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding the use of the information we collect. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for the Services.  If you are using any of the Services through an educational or other institution that is a customer of Lightspeed Systems, this policy does not supersede the terms of any agreements between Lightspeed Systems and any other party, nor does it affect the terms of any agreement between any user of the Services and their employer, their educational institution or any third party.  Please make sure that you read the terms of any privacy policies that you enter into with parties other than Lightspeed Systems, including your employer or educational institution, as those policies may also explain how your personal information is used by those parties. If you are accessing Lightspeed through a third-party, public or unsecured internet provider, please be advised that any information you disclose or publish during the course of such access may be collected by any such provider and that Lightspeed Systems has no control and makes no representation as to the possible use of this information by any such provider.
Please review the following statement to understand how the information you provide to Lightspeed Systems through the Services will be treated.
Information Lightspeed Systems collects.
It is Lightspeed Systems' policy to limit the collection of personal information from children to only that which is necessary to utilize Lightspeed Systems products and services. Parents should consult the school's Acceptable Use, Social Media, Personnel and Instructional Policies for more information about the school's policies and practices for protecting children on the Internet. Teachers are reminded to also be aware of their obligations under the Ethical Standards for educators in their state, and to be conscious of their role as a model for students while interacting with students while using Lightspeed Systems products and services.
For all Lightspeed Systems products and services (e.g., MyBigCampus): we may collect the following types of personally identifiable information directly from children: first name; last name; email address; mobile phone number and carrier (optional for notifications); password; IP address; grade level; and school. We may also generate a login ID for the child that is different than the child's actual name.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information: We may collect certain non-personally identifiable information from visitors to our site, such as the date and time of their visit, the type of browser used (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system used (e.g., Windows 7 or Mac OS), the ISP from which the visitor receives Internet access, and aggregate information regarding what pages users of the site access or visit.
We may also collect non-personally identifiable information from registered members and match it to personally identifiable information (such as the member's name) in our database. Such combined information is kept in our internal database under the member's user name.
Lightspeed Systems gathers information about all users collectively, such as what areas users visit most frequently and what services users access most often. Lightspeed Systems automatically logs IP addresses, session sources, and other data which tracks users' access to the Services. We analyze these logs for sales and marketing purposes as well as system performance monitoring. These logs are analyzed for the aggregate trends they reveal about our customers and how the customers use the Services, not for the behaviors of individual users.
Student Safety
Lightspeed Systems, makers of My Big Campus, complies with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA, see www.ftc.gov/privacy/coppafaqs ) to insure the online safety of children. Student accounts on My Big Campus are provided only through a verified educator, school, or educational organization. Educators should obtain parental permission before issuing accounts to students.
We meet the following guidelines listed below and agree to:
NOT collect online contact information without the consent of either a parent or a qualified educator or educational institution. Without prior parental consent, online information will only be used to respond directly to the child's request and will not be used for other purposes
NOT collect personally identifiable offline contact information without prior parental consent
NOT distribute to third parties any personally identifiable information without prior parental consent
NOT entice by the prospect of a special game, prize or other activity or to divulge more information than is needed to participate in the activity
Purposes of Data Collection
