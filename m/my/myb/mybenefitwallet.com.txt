Collection of Personally Identifiable Information
You may choose to give us personally identifiable information online to allow us to communicate with you or provide you with services. Our online forms ask for a small amount of relevant information, such as name, email, and employer name. The member portal requests information including, but not limited to, direct deposit information, such as bank, account, and routing numbers, which are passed on to other parties and are not stored by us. Information collected in the member portal and stored by us would include, but is not limited to, email and physical addresses, coverage levels, telephone numbers, alternate contacts, communications with you and user IDs and passwords. Some of this information may be passed on to third parties who perform services for us.
We may also collect information about your visits to our websites, including your Internet Protocol (IP) address, operating system, browser type and language, location information and details of your browsing patterns and communication data. This is more fully described under the section entitled “Cookies” below. We collect this information to determine such things as the number of visitors to various parts of our websites and to personalize your experience on our sites, and tailor our interactions with you.
Information collected and stored in the employer portal would include, but not be limited to, employee’s name, payroll information (such as employee and employer contributions), employer’s bank account information, profiles of persons with access to the employer’s portal (name, email and physical address, telephone numbers), and those persons’ user IDs and passwords.

The employer portal also has a function to send emails.
