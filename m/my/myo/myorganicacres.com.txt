Registration
In order for you to receive specific benefits of our website you may first be asked to supply certain information such as your zip code. Garden Fresh Co-op wants to supply you with information that benefits you and the more relevant information we have about you the better we are able to do this.
Garden Fresh Co-op currently has an electronic newsletter and may launch similar products in the future. If you choose to receive our electronic newsletter, you will be asked for certain information so that we can customize your newsletter to suit your needs. Upon registering for the electronic newsletter, you will be asked for your name, email address, zip code, and other information specified in the enrollment process. You may be asked to tell us a little about your interests, including but not limited to, what sorts of articles you like to read, the sorts of wellness choices you currently make, and other questions of this nature. This information is used to deliver you a personalized electronic newsletter that we believe will be of interest to you. The more of this information you choose to share with us, the better we can craft a newsletter specifically for you.
If you choose not to share information with us the newsletter will simply be more generic. For example, if you are primarily interested in articles about the environment, we can't deliver those to you unless you share your interest with us. Similarly, if you are a vegetarian and request recipes without disclosing this fact, we can't guarantee that all recipes we send you will be meat-free. Providing us with this type of information is voluntary and you may change supplied information or unsubscribe at any time from any portion or all of Garden Fresh Co-op's online services.
