You can also chose to disable or selectively turn off cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security. However, this can affect how you are able to interact with websites. For example, entirely blocking cookies can cause the inability to login to services or programs, such as logging into forums or accounts.
