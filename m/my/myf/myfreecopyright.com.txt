Privacy Policy
Privacy Guarantee
Your copyright registrations will always be completed with confidentiality. Your name and information you provide will never be sold to marketing or direct-mail companies, and you will never be overwhelmed with mailings from us.
Commitment to Your Privacy
This site is owned and operated by MyFreeCopyright.com, Inc. Your privacy is of the utmost importance to us and we want to make your experience with us satisfying and safe.
Since we do gather certain types of information about our users, we feel you should fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. This privacy notice discloses what information we gather and how we may use it.
Information MyFreeCopyright.com, Inc. May Gather and Track
Information that users provide through optional, voluntary submissions. For example, voluntary submissions to register a copyright, to receive our electronic newsletters or reports, to participate in our weblog or forums, to tell a friend, and from participation in polls and surveys, etc.
Information gathered through aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our site. This information allows us to better tailor our content to users' needs and to help us better understand the demographics of our audience. Under no circumstances does MyFreeCopyright.com, Inc. divulge any information about an individual user to a third party.
MyFreeCopyright.com, Inc. May Gather User Information in the Following Processes:
Optional Voluntary Information
We offer the following services, which require some type of voluntary submission of personal information by users:
Copyright registrations
MyFreeCopyright.com, Inc. gathers email address, name, country, and password of users who voluntarily choose to use our services. Users will also be required to provide details of your copyright as well as submitting the copyright to be fingerprinted. Once fingerprinted, your copyright is permanently deleted and is kept safe during the fingerprinting process. At any time an account can be closed by contacting MyFreeCopyright.com, Inc.
Electronic newsletters
MyFreeCopyright.com, Inc. gathers the name and email address of users who voluntarily subscribe. Users may remove themselves from this mailing list by following the link provided in every newsletter that points users to the subscription management page. Or, in the event no such link is provided, users may email MyFreeCopyright.com, Inc. requesting to be removed from this mailing list. Users can also subscribe to the newsletters at the time of registration.
Weblog, forums, and email
Users of the site's Message Boards, Forums, Chat, and Email may be required to register separately for these services (all are free of charge) in order to post messages and/or use email, although they needn't register to visit the site. During registration the user is required to supply a password and email address.
Polling and Reviews
We may offer interactive polls and customer reviews to users so they can easily share their opinions with other users and see what our audience thinks about important issues. Opinions or other responses to polls and reviews are aggregated and are not identifiable to any particular user. MyFreeCopyright.com, Inc. may use a system to "tag" users after they have voted or issued a review, so they can vote/review only once on a particular question/product. This tag is not correlated with information about individual users.
Surveys
MyFreeCopyright.com, Inc. may occasionally conduct user surveys to better target our content to our audience. We never share any of this information about specific individuals with any third party.
Contests
MyFreeCopyright.com, Inc. may occasionally offer promotional contests to our audience. When you enter a contest or other promotional feature, we may ask for identifying information such as your name and email address so we can administer the contest and notify winners. We never share any of this information about specific individuals with any third party.
Upgrades
MyFreeCopyright.com, Inc. gathers name, address, country, credit card number and credit card expiration when a user chooses to upgrade their account from the free service. MyFreeCopyright.com, Inc. will not store this information and is only used during the process of billing. Our secure server has been approved by the merchant providers to be safe and compliant with the latest security measures to ensure your protection.
Usage Tracking
MyFreeCopyright.com, Inc. tracks user traffic patterns throughout all of our site. However, we do not correlate this information with data about individual users. MyFreeCopyright.com, Inc. does break down overall usage statistics according to a user's domain name, browser type, and MIME type by reading this information from the browser string (information contained in every user's browser).
MyFreeCopyright.com, Inc. sometimes tracks and catalogs the search terms that users enter in our Search function, but this tracking is never associated with individual users. We use tracking information to determine which areas of our site users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you.
Cookies
We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain Personal Information although it will enable us to relate your use of this site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided.

Use of Information

As stated above, we use information that users voluntarily provide in order to send out electronic newsletters and to enable users to participate in weblog, forums, email, polling, reviews, surveys, etc. We send out newsletters to subscribers on a regular schedule (depending on the newsletter), and occasionally send out special editions when we think subscribers might be particularly interested in something we are doing. MyFreeCopyright.com, Inc. never shares newsletter mailing lists with any third parties, including advertisers, sponsors or partners.
We use tracking information to determine which areas of our site users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas.
