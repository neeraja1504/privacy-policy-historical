What is our policy regarding personally identifiable information from children under 13?

If you are not over 13 years old, DO NOT DOWNLOAD ANY SEARCH APPLICATION OR USE THE SITE, SERVICES OR SITE SERVICES.
Do we take security precautions to protect your information?
We have security measures in place that are designed to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access to information we collect online. We utilize both industry and proprietary standards to preserve the confidentiality of information. We seek to limit access to our users' information to employees who we believe reasonably need access to that information to provide products or services to you or in order to perform their jobs. These employees have been informed of the need to maintain the security and confidentiality of such information. Unfortunately, no security system can be 100% secure; accordingly, we cannot guarantee the security of the information that we collect online.
Do Not Track Signals. Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services.
We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for third party purposes, and that is why we provide the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out link above. However, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals that provide consumers the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personally identifiable information about an individual consumer's online activities over time and across third-party Web sites or online services.
