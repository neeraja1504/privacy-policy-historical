Family Travel Forum Inc. may, however, use this data about all site visitors and their travel patterns, as a group, to improve the relevance of our content and support our travelers’ network.
In addition to webforms, Family Travel Forum Inc. gives users an opportunity to submit their personal information to request certain reports and / or subscribe to our travel e-newsletter. Communication is important to our community of family travelers and their children.

Family Travel Forum Inc. follows generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.

Children’s Data and COPPA Compliance
Family Travel Forum Inc. provides content and forums to children but does not knowingly collect or store any personal information about children under the age of 13, even as group data. However, children age 12 may be eligible to enter the FTF Teen Travel Writing Scholarship and if they do so, the personal information collected from them along with their application shall remain in the Family Travel Forum Inc. database until such time as they are disqualified from the competition or 90 days after the winners are announced, whichever is sooner.  After that time, their information will be deleted from our storage.  We encourage parents to monitor children’s use of this and all other Internet sites and to have minors ask for permission to share any information with this or any other site. If you are a parent and feel that your child may have submitted personally identifiable information that you would like us to delete, please contact us at +1 212-595-6074 or by email at [email protected] familytravelforum.com.

Please use the Contact Us page to contact Family Travel Forum staff for approval in order to activate your minor child’s account.
How Ad Servers and Third Party Collectors of Data Work
All users who receive an ad served by Family Travel Forum Inc.’s ad serving partners retain complete anonymity. As ads are delivered, advertisers may use software called “cookies” (the term cookies to include this tracking technology as well as pixels and web beacons) to collect information which is specific to how you use the Internet. In accordance with GDPR privacy regulations, users resident in European Union countries visiting Family Travel Forum sites will be shown a cookies  permission form and must act to allow their use, if they so choose.
Because our sites are partially supported by affiliate marketing and internet advertising, we use affiliate networks, Mediavine, the Doubleclick Ad Serving platform and Google AdWords, any and all of which may use cookies that collect anonymous data for remarketing, interest categories, similar audiences, other types of interest-based advertising, and demographic and location targeting. This information is obtained solely for the purpose of making ads more relevant to you, and measuring a given ad’s effectiveness on behalf of the ad server’s clients and customers. Users who opt out of having cookies served during their session will be shown non targeted advertising.
If you want to prevent a third-party advertiser from setting and/or reading cookies on your computer, you may either visit each ad server’s web site individually and register your choice (“opt out”) or you may visit the Network Advertising Initiative ‘s (“NAI”) site to opt-out of many of the third-party advertising companies’ cookies. There are instances where a user may provide specific personal information in response to an ad containing a survey, purchase agreement, or registration questionnaire. For such programs, an ad server (or a third party working in conjunction with the advertiser) acquires this information on behalf of the advertiser client. This information is used by the client so the user can receive the goods or services requested. When requested, ad servers may employ this information in a compiled format without identifying users specifically to provide to the advertiser client precise profiles of the types of individuals responding to the ads.
Notification of Changes
This Privacy Policy has been revised as of May 23, 2018. If we decide to change our privacy policy, Family Travel Forum Inc. will post these changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. Regardless of later updates, Family Travel Forum Inc. will never use the information you submit under this current policy in a new way without first providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prevent that use.
Rest assured that we have deep respect for your privacy. If you believe we have not met this commitment to online privacy for you or your family, please contact Customer Service at +1 212/595-6074 or via email at [email protected] familytravelforum.com.
