II. TERMS OF SERVICE
MyUS.com will provide the Member with a suite number at the Access USA facility in the United States at which the Member can have mail and/or merchandise delivered prior to export.
MyUS.com's services consist of acting as an agent of the Member for consolidation and export purposes by receiving the Member's merchandise, which will be sorted, packed, and consolidated. At the Member's direction, MyUS.com arranges for export to the Member's specified local address by an unaffiliated service provider, which acts as the freight forwarder and/or carrier for the shipment. MyUS.com does not act as an indirect air carrier of property, but rather acts as an agent of the shipper ( i.e., Members). All packages received by MyUS.com will be opened by representatives of the company. Members are responsible for all import obligations in the country to which all mail (for a Premium+Mail Member only) and packages will be sent. Members also authorize MyUS.com as its agent to authorize freight forwarder and/or carriers to conduct customs clearance and entry and to certify freight forwarder and/or carriers as the consignee solely for the purpose of designating a customs broker to perform customs clearance and entry.
Members accept that freight forwarders and/or carriers reserve the right to open and/or inspect every shipment tendered to forwarders and/or carriers on behalf of an Access USA Member.
For Premium+Mail Members, MyUS.com also will receive the Member's mail ( i.e. , letters, catalogs, and newspapers), MyUS.com cannot hold or store mail that will not fit into a 4 inch-tall mailbox. MyUS.com will notify the Member via e-mail once his/her mailbox is full, and the Member will have 5 days to either (a) request shipment of the mail or (b) request that MyUS.com discard the mail. If no reply is received from the Member, MyUS.com, in accordance with these terms, understands that the Member is directing MyUS.com to send the mail to the Member's address on record through an unaffiliated freight forwarder or carrier. Any charges generated directly from this activity, including taxes, customs duties, and service charges (including any charges that may be established in the future) will be the responsibility of the Member.
The Member authorizes MyUS.com to charge his/her payment method for all services and/or account activity with MyUS.com. Such charges may include but are not limited to membership dues, shipping and handling charges, return/reroute fees, storage charges, late charges, and any optional services. Failure to provide payment for services rendered at the time of service may result in late charges, stop shipment charges, suspension of service, cancellation of membership, and involuntary return or the discarding of any remaining merchandise.
If a Member's payment method is by credit card, and if such Member has an outstanding invoice or invoices, the Member authorizes MyUS.com to charge his/her credit card for the aggregate amount of such outstanding invoice or invoices in one or more credit card transactions. By way of example, if a Member has an outstanding invoice or invoices of $3,000 in the aggregate, the Company may either charge the Member's credit card (i) one time for $3,000, (ii) three times for $1,000 each or (iii) any other combination that in the aggregate equals $3,000.
Shipping costs are based on the weight and dimensions of your shipments. Shipping costs will be charged according to the actual weight or dimensional weight, whichever is greater
MyUS.com will allow active Premium and Premium+Mail Members to store their merchandise for up to 30 days at no charge. MyUS.com will allow active Basic Members to store their merchandise for up to 5 days at no charge. After 30 days for Premium and Premium+Mail Members, or after 5 days for Basic Members, the Member agrees to pay storage charges per box per day, consistent with MyUS.com's current schedule of fees
Prohibited or restricted merchandise is not storable and will be rejected, forfeited (and sold with the proceeds donated to charity), destroyed, or provided to government officials
Insurance costs for shipments of merchandise are based on the insured value. Each US $100 of insured value costs US $2.99. The insured value is subject to the terms and conditions of the particular carrier's airway bill(s). All claims are reviewed individually and any claim payment will be based on the declared value
Claims for lost or damaged merchandise must be filed within the published time limits of the particular carrier. Claims are considered filed when a fully completed claim form, photograph(s), and supporting documentation, including receipts, are received by MyUS.com. Claims are reviewed individually and the review process will take a minimum of eight (8) weeks. Specific commodities, including televisions, computers, electronics, jewelry, figurines, furniture and lighting have limits of liability in case of loss or damage regardless of the declared value or insurance costs paid. Any liability for damage or loss caused after delivery to MyUS.com is limited to the lesser of either the declared value, proof of purchase price, or the specific commodity liability limit. No liability will be assumed by MyUS.com for damage or loss caused to any items before delivery to MyUS.com or caused to merchandise prepackaged by manufacturer. Failure to file a completed claim within the carrier time limit will invalidate the claim. MyUS.com has an Inland Marine insurance policy, with a liability limit of $500,000. MyUS.com does not maintain its own Aircraft Accident Liability Insurance coverage.
Either party may cancel the Membership Agreement with written notice (via email, fax, letter, or, to the extent provided by the MyUS.com website, online). Upon cancellation, MyUS.com Members will receive a prorated refund on the unused portion of their annual membership charge. Annual membership refunds are based on the monthly membership usage rate for a Premium+Mail Membership and a Premium Membership listed in MyUS.com's current schedule of fees. Refunds will be processed within ten (10) business days of cancellation.
Each Member, as collateral security for the prompt and complete payment and performance when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) of any amounts owed to MyUS.com by such Member, whether under these Terms and Conditions or otherwise (the "Secured Obligations"), hereby mortgages, pledges and hypothecates to MyUS.com and grants to MyUS.com a lien on and security interest in, all of its right, title and interest in, to and under any and all packages shipped by such Member to MyUS.com.
If a Member's account charges become delinquent for more than thirty (30) days, MyUS.com may exercise, in addition to all other rights and remedies granted to it in these Terms and Conditions and in any other instrument or agreement securing, evidencing or relating to any Secured Obligation, all rights and remedies of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code or any other applicable law.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, MyUS.com may, without demand of performance or other demand, presentment, protest, advertisement or notice of any kind (except any notice required by law referred to below) to or upon a Member or any other person (all and each of which demands, defenses, advertisements and notices are hereby waived to the extent permitted by law), during the continuance of any account delinquency (personally or through its agents or attorneys), (i) enter upon the premises where any and all packages shipped by such Member to MyUS.com are located, without any obligation to pay rent, through self-help to the extent permitted by law, without judicial process, without first obtaining a final judgment or giving a Member or any other person notice or opportunity for a hearing on MyUS.com's claim or action, except as may be required by applicable non-waivable laws, (ii) collect, receive, appropriate and realize upon any such packages and (iii) sell, assign, convey, transfer, grant option or options to purchase and deliver any such packages, in one or more parcels at public or private sale or sales, at any exchange, broker's board or office of MyUS.com or elsewhere upon such terms and conditions as it may deem advisable and at such prices as it may deem best, for cash or on credit or for future delivery without assumption of any credit risk, in each case, subject to applicable non-waivable laws. MyUS.com shall have the right, upon any such public sale or sales and, to the extent permitted by the Uniform Commercial Code and other applicable laws, upon any such private sale, to purchase the whole or any part of such packages so sold, free of any right or equity of redemption of a Member, which right or equity is hereby waived and released.
Title to any items that cannot be exported after arrival at the MyUS.com facility will be forfeited by the Member. MyUS.com will have the option of returning all such forfeited packages/mail to the sender(s) and/or of discarding the items, including by (1) selling any items not returned to the seller and then providing the proceeds of such sales to charity, (2) destroying such items, or (3) providing such items to a government official.
The Member agrees and acknowledges that he/she shall purchase any and all merchandise from Sellers in a manner that (1) transfers title to the Member prior to the time that the merchandise is received at the Access USA warehouse and (2) in accordance with risk of loss terms that provide either that the buyer or the Member bears the full costs and risks of moving the goods from the buyer's location to the Access USA warehouse.

If a Member's account charges become delinquent for more than 30 days, MyUS.com may, at its sole discretion, cancel the Member's membership, process all packages and mail by returning the same to the sender, or discarding all packages and mail. The Member forfeits all claims to items abandoned in his/her mailbox once the membership is cancelled.

Each package received by MyUS.com with an incomplete, incorrect, or old address that can be associated with a Member will be assessed a charge consistent with MyUS.com's current schedule of fees.

Additional information is provided in Subsection III.D ("Compliance with the Foreign Trade Regulations") below. It ultimately is the responsibility of the Member to ensure that the seller provides the export classification of the merchandise and determines if any export licenses are required for the merchandise.
