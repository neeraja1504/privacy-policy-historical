Personal Information Collected Via Technology
As you navigate the website, certain information may also be passively collected and stored on our server logs, including your Internet protocol address, browser type, and operating system. We also use Cookies and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the solutions and information for which you searched and viewed, or on which of the advertisements displayed on the Website you clicked. This type of information is collected to make our services and solutions more useful to you and to tailor the MYPAGE5.COM community experience to meet your special interests and needs.
If you search the MYPAGE5.COM community by using a toolbar that MYPAGE5.COM or a third party provides, we may collect anonymous information about you automatically, but we will not collect Personal Information.
An “Internet Protocol Address” or “IP Address” is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the internet. In some cases your IP Address stays the same from browser session to browser session; but if you use a consumer internet access provider, your IP Address probably varies from session to session. We track your IP Address when you login to the Website.
“Cookies” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing a website. MYPAGE5.COM may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on the website. Persistent Cookies can be removed by following your Internet browser help file directions. If you choose to disable Cookies, some areas of the website may not work properly.
Other third parties may place advertisements and cookies on web pages within the MYPAGE5.COM network. Other companies’ use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one.

We have physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect personal information about you and your MYPAGE5.COM account information is protected by a password that you select. MYPAGE5.COM uses industry standard SSL encryption in certain areas of the website to protect data transmissions.
However, no company, including MYPAGE5.COM, can fully eliminate security risks associated with Personal Information.
