MyPlan.com :: Privacy Policy
INTRODUCTION
MyPlan.com is committed to protecting your privacy. Except as described below and as required by law, we will never knowingly sell, share, loan, rent or otherwise transfer your personal information to others. Put simply — that means we won't sell your personal contact information to others. We take your privacy seriously! And, because we gather certain types of information about our users, we want to help you understand the terms and conditions surrounding the collection and use of that information. This privacy policy discloses the types of information we gather, how we use it, and how you may correct or change it. These privacy practices apply to MyPlan.com and do not cover the privacy practices of our advertisers, business partners or websites that may be linked to from within MyPlan.com.
COLLECTION OF INFORMATION
Information is collected about you at several different points during your visit to MyPlan.com. The choice of how much personally identifiable information you disclose to us is completely at your discretion. Most areas of our site are accessible without registration or the disclosure of personally identifiable information of any kind. Registration and submission of some personal information is, however, required to access certain areas of our site and to enable certain functionality, personalized in nature to deliver a customized user experience.
Registration--Users must register in order to use certain parts of this site. During registration, users are required to provide personal information, including, but not limited to: name, e-mail address, a password, and demographic information. In addition, users may choose to provide other types of personally identifiable information such as occupational or educational information to further customize site functionality.
Community Profile--MyPlan.com offers its users a rich set of community features including discussion boards, private messaging and user reviews. In order to enable this functionality, provide user interaction, and ensure security from user abuse, each registered user has a basic public profile that identifies them to MyPlan.com and to other users. This basic public profile includes their MyPlan.com username, IP and private message address. In addition, users can also choose to provide additional information on their public profile, such as their location, email address, IM addresses, personal image, and occupation. Any information that you choose to submit to your public profile will be visible to other users of MyPlan.com. Please keep in mind that if you disclose personal information through the MyPlan.com community profile, this information may be collected and used by others. We caution you against providing personal information to strangers online, which they may use for illegal, harmful or spamming purposes.
Optional Account Information--Various tools and functionality on the MyPlan.com site require that users provide additional information that we store with their account profile. This optional information includes, but is not limited to: stored portfolio items, personal notes, and assessment test scores. This information is stored in order to enable their corresponding functionality and to ensure that users are able to later retrieve this information. This functionality-based information will never be used to personally identify a user for marketing purposes.
At various other points during your visit to MyPlan.com, you may be asked to provide additional information. For example, you may wish to participate in a survey or to submit a review. Participation in surveys or reviews or the use of other services which require the input of additional information is completely voluntary on your part, and you have the choice about whether to disclose the information necessary to use these features of our site.
Passive Collection of Information--In addition to the information which you actively provide to MyPlan.com by methods such as registration or survey completion, MyPlan.com collects information about how you interact with our site. MyPlan.com collects passive information for purposes such as testing and improving a user's experience at the site and the compilation of broad aggregate demographic data and related usage information for internal purposes and for disclosure to third parties such as advertisers and content partners. The types of passive information collected by this site include, without limitation, your IP address, which type of browser you are using, where you go on our site, and how long you stay on any part of our site. Passive information does not identify you to MyPlan.com by name, except user IP address which is recorded for security and monitoring purposes.
USE OF COOKIES
MyPlan.com uses cookies to store visitors' preferences and to record session information. A cookie is a small text file placed on a user's computer hard drive when a user visits a website. The cookie gives the user a unique, random ID, and this ID enables our site to readily recognize each visitor as they page through our site or return on subsequent visits. Cookies enable you to maintain continuity as you move from page to page on MyPlan.com and to avoid the nuisance of being asked to provide the same information repeatedly. Cookies also allow us to make sure that only your browser can exchange information regarding your account with our servers.
We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. You may be able to configure your browser to accept or reject all or some cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set -- each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences -- however, you must enable cookies from MyPlan.com in order to use most functions on our site. Please note that MyPlan.com allows 3rd party advertisers that are presenting advertisements on some of our pages to set and access their cookies on your computer. Advertisers' use of cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not the MyPlan.com Privacy Policy.
USE OF WEB BEACONS

Site Enhancements--The information which you supply to MyPlan.com enables us to continue developing and enhancing our website. When personal information is used in such a manner, users will not be personally identified, except with their expressed and explicit permission (such as in the writing of a review). Most such types of site enhancements involve the use of broad aggregate demographic data and related usage information for the development of content and new functionality.
Site Personalization and Customization--In addition to site enhancements, MyPlan.com uses personal information to customize or personalize our site for each registered user. MyPlan.com tries to recognize you using various methods including login procedures and cookies. Once recognized, pages, layout, content, and/or advertisements may be customized for you so that you see information that reflects your profile and interests.

You may subscribe or unsubscribe to such communications at any point by visiting the ‘Email Subscriptions’ section of the Account Manager.

Other--Most other uses of personal information involve aggregate data usage, such as statistical studies and research as well as the development of new products and services. Personal information is also collected and used to complete a transaction such as the purchase of an assessment test license. Note: Credit card and banking information is never stored on our servers; it is merely transmitted to our payment gateway at Authorize.net via 56-bit Secure Sockets Layer encryption.
SHARED ACCESS TO TEST RESULTS
MyPlan.com allows users to share their career assessment test results with others (including but not limited to the owner of a group license). The choice of whether to share such information and with whom is completely at the discretion of the user. MyPlan.com merely facilitates this sharing of personal information at the direction of the user. Any abuse, grievance, harm, intrusion, or damage that ensues from this exchange of information is the responsibility of the user who expressly requested that such information be shared.
SHARING OF INFORMATION
We will not knowingly sell, share, loan, rent or otherwise transfer your personal information other than in accordance with the terms set forth in this Privacy Policy.
MyPlan.com will not disclose personal information to any third party unless we believe that disclosure is necessary: (1) to conform to legal requirements or to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other legal process received by MyPlan.com, whether or not a response is required by applicable law; (2) to enforce the MyPlan.com Terms of Use Agreement or to protect our rights; (3) to protect the safety of members of the public and users of our service; or (4) to oblige the user’s expressed desire to share career assessment test results with others. We may, however, share broad aggregate demographic data and related usage information with the public or our business partners. This aggregate information does not contain any personal information which can identify any individual user.
SECURITY
Security of data is of paramount importance to us. MyPlan.com has rigorous security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, theft, and/or unauthorized alteration of information under our control. You are the only user authorized to update your profile, unless you provide your password information to another party.
Password Encryption--User passwords are stored on our servers using one-way 128-bit MD5 hash encryption, meaning that not even we have access to your password. If you lose or forget your password, we are not able to retrieve it; we can only issue you a new temporary password that you must authorize and activate by email.
Payment Information--While credit card and banking data may be collected in our checkout forms in order to complete a transaction, that information is never stored on our servers. Payment information is transmitted to our transaction gateway at Authorize.net via 56-bit Secure Sockets Layer encryption.
Physical Security of Servers--Our servers are housed in a co-location facility that is under 24-hour armed guard surveillance, with back-up generators and secured data recovery procedures. Our servers also utilize industry-leading security methods such as firewalls, server passwords, and malicious script scrubbing.
While we take every reasonable and practical measure to ensure the privacy and protection of your data, you should recognize that no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.
