Please read the following to learn more about how we collect, store, use and disclose information about you when you interact or use our website or any of our products, services or applications (including any trial) (collectively the “Services”) in any manner.
What does this Privacy Policy cover?
This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of information that we gather when you are accessing or using our Websites or Services or when you contact us in any manner.
For the purposes of applicable data protection law, MPP is the controller of any personal data collected from you on the Site, through the Services, or otherwise for the purpose of conducting or developing our business with customers and vendors. For the purposes of this Notice, personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable person.
What information does MPP Collect?
Information We Automatically Collect:
When you use the Website: When you visit MyPrivateProxy.net, we collect certain information related to your device, such as your device’s IP address, referring website, what pages your device visited, and the time that your device visited our Website.
When you use the Services: We do not store details of, or monitor, the websites you connect to when using our proxy service. We only collect aggregated statistical (non-personal) data about the usage of our servers.
We need this data so we can monitor the performance and usage of our Proxy Service, resource analytics (to carry out usage analysis for administrative purposes) and to prevent abuse and fraud.
We store this data on our system for between 2 and 3 months unless we are required, for legal reasons or under exceptional circumstances (including our investigations of fraud or abuse), to retain this data for an extended period.
In some cases this information constitutes personal data, We do not use this automatically collected information to try to identify you by name, and we do not associate it with the information you provide voluntarily, as detailed below.
Information You Provide:
In order to access or use certain portions of the Site or Services, or enjoy the full functionality of the Site or Services, or otherwise in conducting business with us or seeking to conduct business with us, you may be prompted to provide certain personal data to us in the following ways:
• persons who subscribe to our Services will be prompted to provide their name, their address, their e-mail, their phone number, and any other necessary billing information.
• site visitors, and prospective and current suppliers and subscribers, may provide personal data when filling in forms (for example, a ‘Contact us’ form) on our Site or by subscribing to newsletters or other communications; by corresponding with us through our ticketing platform, e-mail or otherwise providing contact details. In these cases, typically, the personal data you give us may include name.
• if you opt to pay for the use of our services, we will use a third party payment processor to take payment from you. These third parties are adequately regulated and authorized to handle your payment information, and they will not use your data for promotional purposes or for any other purposes other than providing these services to us.
• we collect payment information, which will vary depending on the payment method chosen by you but may include your name, address and transaction number. We also collect geo-IP data to determine your country of origin. We never handle or store complete credit card numbers, as this is done on our behalf by our payment processors. If you are a business user, you may choose to provide additional details, such as your company name, address and VAT number (if applicable). We store this information as we require a record of your payment for accounting, taxation and invoicing purposes and to manage your account. We may also use your payment information to detect and prevent fraud.

However, in some circumstances we may retain personal data for other periods of time, for instance where we are required to do so in accordance with legal, tax and accounting requirements, or if required to do so by a legal process, legal authority, or other governmental entity having authority to make the request, for so long as required.
With respect to marketing, we retain your personal data for 18 months after your last request for service or other contact you initiate.
External Links
The Site may contain links to third party sites. Since MPP does not control nor is responsible for the privacy practices of those Sites, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third party sites. This Notice applies solely to personal data collected by our Site or in the course of our business activities.
Your Rights
Right to withdraw consent – where applicable, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. For example, if you wish to opt-out of receiving electronic marketing communications, you can change your settings in your account on the Site, use the ‘unsubscribe’ link provided in our emails or otherwise contact us directly and we will stop sending you communications.
Right of access, rectification and erasure – you have the right to request access to and obtain a copy of any of your personal data that we may hold, to request correction of any inaccurate data relating to you and to request the deletion of your personal data under certain circumstances. You can see and update most of this data yourself online, or by contacting us directly at https://www.myprivateproxy.net/contact-us/
Data portability – where we are relying (as the legal basis for processing) upon your consent, or the fact that the processing is necessary to perform a contract to which you are party or to take steps at your request prior to entering a contract, and the personal data is processed by automatic means, you have the right to receive all such personal data which you have provided us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, and also to require us to transmit it to another controller where this is technically feasible.
Right to restriction of processing – you have the right to restrict our processing of your personal data (that is, allow only its storage) where:
– you contest the accuracy of the personal data, until we have taken sufficient steps to correct or verify its accuracy;
– where the processing is unlawful but you do not want us to erase the personal data;
– where we no longer need your personal data for the purposes of the processing, but you require such personal data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; or
– where you have objected to processing justified on legitimate interest grounds (see below), pending verification as to whether we have compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing.
– where your personal data is subject to restriction we will only process it with your consent or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
– you also have the right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority of your habitual residence, place of work or place of alleged infringement, if you consider that the processing of your personal data infringes applicable law.
Right to object to processing (including profiling) based on legitimate interest grounds – where we are relying upon legitimate interests to process personal data, you have the right to object to that processing. If you object, we must stop that processing unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override your interests, rights and freedoms, or we need to process the personal data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. Where we rely upon legitimate interest as a basis for processing we believe that we can demonstrate such compelling legitimate grounds, but we will consider each case on an individual basis.
Right to object to direct marketing (including profiling) – you have the right to object to our use of your personal data (including profiling) for direct marketing purposes, such as when we use your personal data to invite you to our promotional events.
