We do not guarantee employment for any user of this Site. Nor do we guarantee that any employer will find qualified candidates through this Site. When you use the Site, you are contracting with the Provider. If you reside outside the United States, the Provider [Bold LLC, City View Plaza II 48 Road 165 Suite 6000 Guaynabo, Puerto Rico 00968] is your data controller.

Personal Information is only associated with your account/profile when you sign in as a registered user.
b) Information to respond to your requests: You can give us your Personal Information so that we can respond to your questions and requests, as well as send you newsletters and other communications that you request. Details of how you can opt out of receiving any communications from us are provided in the section headed Accessing, reviewing and changing your Personal Information
c) Social media information: We can offer sign-on services that allow you to use third-party login credentials to access the Site. We also can offer services that allow you to share information with third-party social media websites such as Facebook, Google Plus, Twitter and others.
When you link your account or engage with our Site through third-party social media sites, you understand that you are allowing us to have ongoing access to certain information stored on these social media sites (e.g. your social networking credentials, your public profile, friends list, people you follow or who follow you, pictures, your email address, date of birth, work history, education history, interests, current city, religious and political views, website, personal description and likes, and your friends' dates of birth, education histories, personal descriptions and likes).

You agree that we can share your video viewing with, or obtain information about your video viewing from, analytics providers and advertising partners, and third-party partners and social media sites, for two years or until you withdraw your consent.
The information to which we have access from third-party social services varies by service and is controlled by your privacy settings on that service and by your consent. Information that can be passed to analytics providers and advertising partners can be via cookies and tracking technology. Please see our Cookies and Tracking Technology Policy for information, including your choices in relation to some of this technology. By associating an account managed by a third party with your Provider account and authorising us to have access to this information, you agree that we can collect, use and store information from these websites in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
d) Information from other sources: The information that we collect can be combined with information from outside public records (e.g. demographic information, navigation information and additional contact information) that we have acquired in accordance with the law.
e) Mobile information: With your consent, we can collect additional information from you if you access our Site through a mobile device (e.g. your unique device identifier, device's operating system, mobile operator, location or GPS/geo-location, mobile number, your text messages, emails or email address, username, contacts/address book, financial or payment information, web browsing history, photos, your phone's name, passwords, political interests, sexual orientation, racial or ethnic origin, religious and philosophical beliefs, and trade union membership.
f) Technical usage information: When you visit our Site, we collect usage information sent to us by your computer, mobile or other access device that tells us how you are using the Site, including video viewing, site views, key-stroke data, mouse movement, scrolling, clicks and typing ('usage information'). We use tracking technology (including cookies, flash cookies, unique device identifiers, web beacons/GIFs, embedded scripts, e-tags/cache browsers and cross-device tracking) to collect usage information. We can use tracking technology for a variety of purposes, including:
Operationally necessary We can use tracking technology required for systems administration, to prevent fraudulent activity, improve security or allow you to make use of shopping-basket functionality. We are not required to obtain your consent to tracking technology that is operationally necessary.
Performance related We can use cookies or other tracking technology to assess the performance of the online services, including as part of our analytics practices to improve the content offered through the online services. For example, as set forth in detail in our Cookies and Tracking Technology Policy, we use Google Analytics and Inspectlet to perform site analytics.
Functionality related We can use tracking technology to tell us, for example, whether you have visited the Site before or if you are a new visitor, and to help us identify the features in which you have the greatest interest.
Targeting related We can use tracking technology to deliver content, including ads, relevant to your interests on our online service and third-party sites based on how you interact with our advertisements or content, as well as track the content that you access (including video viewing). Further information on this and your opting-out choices are shown below.
We can also collect password information from you when you log in, as well as computer and/or connection information. During some visits, we can use software tools to measure and collect session information, including page-response times, download errors, time spent on certain pages and page-interaction information.
Our goal is to collect and use only that information that we think is required for our legitimate business interests in order to better understand your interests and improve your experience of using the Site. You consent to our tracking of your video viewing through the Site or social media for up to two years or until your consent is withdrawn. To learn more about how we use tracking technology and cookies, please see Section 7 of this Privacy Policy.
g) Apply Tool Privacy Notice and information that we collect: We can automatically collect certain information (including Personal Information) from your device or web browser. We can automatically collect information from location storage associated with your web browser, including your browsing behaviour, for career searching activity. We can also automatically record your interaction with certain web pages by accessing local storage associated with your web browser. The Apply Tool was created to automatically interact with third-party websites, so we can also collect some non-personal data about you when you visit those websites, including, clickstream data, operating system being used, the URL of the site that you have come from and move to after your visit, data relating to your activities on third-party websites (including IP addresses and URLs) via tracking technology (such as cookies and measurement software), the date and time of your visit and your server's IP address, the geo-location of your device and the type of payment you use. We collect this information for statistical purposes to find out how our website and the Apply Tool are being used. We can use this information to evaluate and, hopefully, improve your experience. As an example, when you visit a web page that supports the auto-fill function, we can record metadata generated by your web browser that identifies one or more auto-fill fields that you interact with. In this example, we can also access local storage associated with your web browser to determine information (including Personal Information) which can be, or has been, entered into an auto-fill field. We use your information to facilitate your completion of job applications across the Internet, on our websites and third-party websites, and to provide advertising and/or other content that we believe may be of interest to you based upon your browsing behaviour on the Internet.

6. Information that you share on the site.
If you participate in Provider services (e.g. CV posting, profile creation and job alerts) that permit you or the Provider, on your behalf, to post information on third-party sites (e.g. websites, bulletin boards and personal URLs), and if you post information or content, such as by posting photos, or participating in online forums or communities, when you interact with our Site through social media sites, plug-ins or other applications, depending upon your privacy settings, this information can become public on the Internet.

Please refer to these third-party sites' privacy policies and terms of use to learn more about their privacy practices, which we do not control.
a) Other services: If you use the Site, the Provider can create a universal application derived from the information you provide on the Site that will be visible to potential employers who have immediate needs for prospects, as well as visitors to the Site. Therefore, your Site Profile can be publicly viewable. You can elect to have your Profile restricted to registered users only by following the instructions on the Site for that particular setting. You agree that employers and the Provider will use the contact information you have provided to contact you by email and/or SMS text, and you understand that this consent is not a condition to having access to the Site or the Provider's services.

7. Tracking technology (cookies)
When you visit the Site, we and our business partners can use tracking technology to enhance your online experience or customise our offerings. Here are a few additional important things that you should know about our use of tracking technology (cookies):
We can offer certain features that are available only through the use of tracking technology.
We use both session and persistent tracking technology. Tracking technology (e.g. cookies) can either be persistent (i.e. they remain on your computer until you delete them) or temporary (i.e. they last only until you close your browser). You are always free to decline tracking technology if your browser permits this, although doing so can interfere with your use of the Site. Refer to the Help section of your browser, browser extensions or installed applications for instructions on blocking, deleting or disabling tracking technology such as cookies.
We encode and protect the types of tracking technology that the Provider sets so that only we can interpret the information stored in them. You can encounter tracking technology/cookies from the third-party service providers allowed on our Site, such as Google Analytics, which assist us with various aspects of our Site operations and services.
You can also encounter tracking technology from third parties on certain pages of the websites that we do not control and have not authorised. (For example, if you view a web page created by another user, there can be a cookie placed by that web page).
We can target and track the videos that you view on the Site. You consent to our tracking of your video viewing through the Site, or on third-party social media, for up to two years or as permitted by applicable law.
For more information about the use of cookies and similar technology on our Site please review this Privacy Policy and our Tracking Technology Policy.
8. Accessing, reviewing and changing your Personal Information
Registered members can review and change Personal Information at any time by accessing their accounts on the Site (through the My Account and My Settings tabs). You should update your Personal Information promptly if it changes or becomes inaccurate. We can retain some information from closed accounts so that we can comply with the law, prevent fraud, assist with investigations, resolve disputes, analyse or troubleshoot programs, enforce our Terms of Use or take other action permitted by law. Likewise, if your account or membership is terminated or suspended, we can maintain some information to prevent re-registration. For non-registered members, you can update or request access to your Personal Information by contacting us as set forth in Section 16.
We will endeavour to comply with your requests as soon as reasonably possible, but please note that changes requested of us are not always effective immediately. Unless required by law, we are not responsible for informing third parties (including, without limitation, our third-party service providers, potential employers, job-posting sites that you authorise us to contact on your behalf, or strategic or marketing partners) with whom we have already shared your information of any changes requested pursuant to this section, or for removing information from, or causing information to be removed from, the databases or records of such entities.
9. Notice to residents of California
a)  California Civil Code Section 1798.83, known as the 'Shine the light' law, permits those of our customers who are residents of California to request and obtain from us a list of what Personal Information (if any) we have disclosed to third parties for direct-marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year, and the names and addresses of these third parties. Requests can be made only once a year and are free of charge. To make such a request, please contact us at californiarequest@bold.com. For all requests, you must put the statement 'Your California privacy rights' in the body of your request, as well as your name, street address, city, state and zip code. In the body of your request, please provide enough information for us to determine if this applies to you. You need to attest to the fact that you are a resident of California and provide a current address in California for our response. Please note that we will not accept requests via the telephone, by post or via facsimile, and we are not responsible for notices that are not labelled or sent properly, or that do not contain complete information.
b) California Business & Professions Code Section 22575 (b) provides that California residents are entitled to know how the Provider responds to 'Do not track' browser settings. The Provider does not currently take action to respond to Do not track signals because a uniform technological standard has not yet been adopted. We continue to review new technology and may adopt a standard once one is universally accepted.
10. Notice to residents of the European Union
a)  The Provider complies with the General Data Protection Regulation ('GDPR'). As such, the Provider affords to all European data subjects their respective data privacy rights to the extent that they are applicable, including: (i) the right to rectify inaccurate data; (ii) the right to erasure (deletion of your Personal Information); (iii) the right to restrict processing of your Personal Information; (iv) the right of data portability; and (v) the right to object. You can exercise any of these rights by contacting us at boldforeigndispute@bold.com or Contact us. In order to safeguard your Personal Information from unauthorised access, we can ask that you provide sufficient information to identify yourself prior to providing access to your Personal Information.
b)  In certain situations, and subject to applicable law, the Provider will not be able or obliged to comply with part or all of your individual requests. Please note that we have the right to refuse and/or charge a monetary fee for requests that are manifestly unfounded or excessive, for example due to their repetitive character. If you have unresolved concerns, you have the right to complain to an EU supervisory authority.
c)  Providing your information to us is optional, but it can affect our ability to offer you the Service. For example, if you do not provide your complete Personal Information, we will not always be able to respond to your request in a timely manner.
11. Third parties
Our Site can contain links to other third-party websites, and the Provider can provide products and services that share information with third-party sites for your job search. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these third-party sites, so it is important to familiarise yourself with their privacy policies before providing your Personal Information.
12. Information security
We maintain technical, physical and administrative security measures designed to protect the security of your Personal Information against loss, misuse, unauthorised or accidental access, disclosure, copying, use or alteration. Some of the safeguards that we use are firewalls, data encryption, physical access controls to our data centres, information access authorisation controls and other measures in accordance with industry standards. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is totally secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
13. Children's privacy
The Site is a general-audience site and it is not intended for children under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information via our websites, applications, services or tools from users in this age group.

14. Storage and international transfer
As we operate internationally, and many of our computer systems are currently based globally, for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, your Personal Information can be stored and processed elsewhere by us, our affiliates or an unaffiliated service provider. The data protection and privacy regulations do not always offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world, such as the European Economic Area ('EEA'). When you create an account/profile or otherwise provide us with Personal Information, you consent to the collection, storage and/or processing, in the United States and other countries, of your Personal Information and tracking technology/cookies as described in this Policy. We take appropriate measures to ensure adequate protection of the privacy rights of EEA data subjects with respect to Personal Information that we transfer outside the EEA to a country that is not subject to an adequacy decision by the EU Commission. To obtain a copy of the relevant transfer mechanism or additional information on the transfers, please address these requests to Contact us.
15. Notification regarding updates
