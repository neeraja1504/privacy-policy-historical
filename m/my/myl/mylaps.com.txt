Your choices
We want to know you better so we can serve you better. But the choice of whether you want this kind of service is up to you. We do not require visitors to Mylaps.com web sites to share personally identifiable information.
We will only collect, use or share your personally identifiable information if you give us explicit permission to do so. By completing any online registration form (and checking/ticking the opt-in box where required by law), you are giving us permission to use and share your information under the rules set out below.

Sharing information
You should know that by registering you are giving Mylaps.com permission to transfer your personally identifiable information from your home country to other Mylaps.com divisions, or selected companies around the world, who may communicate with you about products or special offers you may find useful. Some of these partner companies may repackage the information and use it under rules and conditions specified by Mylaps.com.
Mylaps.com will not share any personal financial information you provide (such as credit card information) with other companies. From time to time, this website may provide links to other websites. You should carefully review the privacy policies on those sites; they may differ from the Mylaps.com Privacy Policy.
Cookies
