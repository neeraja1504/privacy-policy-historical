Pearson may disclose PII to third parties not affiliated with Pearson, in the following situations.

You should be aware that any PII voluntarily posted to a public area of a Pearson application (posting to a bulletin board or chat room) might be collected and used by others. Pearson cannot prevent such uses.
SPECIAL NOTICE TO PARENTS: Pearson has no intention of seeking PII about minors (children under age 13). If obtained, Pearson’s privacy policies will apply to that information.
