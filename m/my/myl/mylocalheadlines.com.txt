At MyLocalHeadlines LLC, ("MyLocalHeadlines", "we" or "us"), we know our visitors and advertisers (collectively, "you" or "users") value their privacy, and we have created this privacy policy to ensure that you understand our policies and procedures regarding the types of information we collect or that you may provide to us in connection with use of www.MyLocalHeadlines.com (the "Site") and our MyLocalHeadlines service (the "Service") and how we use such information.
Personal Information Collection & Usage: MyLocalHeadlines only collects personal information from you when it is voluntarily provided by you. Personal information may include name, title, company, email address, physical address, telephone number, credit card information and similar information which identifies you. We may use this information in a variety of ways. For example, we may use this information so that you may obtain access to advertiser-only portions of the Service and/or to receive MyLocalHeadlines information, products and services. In addition, we may share your personal information with our affiliates, technical consultants, third party auditors and other third parties who make our Site and Service available, enhance its functionality or provide associated services and/or who deal with you in processing your orders and/or deliver the Services or related services. The personal information you provide is considered a company asset and may be included among transferred assets if our company or any of its assets are ever acquired by or transferred to a third party or an affiliate.
From time to time we may supplement personal information you give us with information from other sources, such as information validating your address. Thus, information we obtain through the Site and Service may be intermingled with and used in conjunction with information obtained through sources other than the Site or Service, including both offline and online sources.
Aggregate Information Collection & Usage: We may collect information from you in an aggregate, anonymous form, which means that the information will not contain nor be linked to any personal information. For instance, we may aggregate data based upon the advertisements you upload and deliver through our Service, the Targeting Criteria (described in the Terms and Conditions) you select, the amount of money you spend on your account and other campaign or user data. MyLocalHeadlines uses this information to measure the use of our Site and Service, to report to our business partners aggregate statistics regarding use of our Service, to improve our Site and Service and for other business purposes.

Clickstream: As you use the Internet, a trail of electronic information is left at each web site you visit. This information, which is sometimes referred to as "clickstream data," can be collected and stored by a web site's server. Clickstream data can tell us the type of computer and browsing software you use and the address of the web site from which you linked to the Site. We may use clickstream data as a form of aggregate information to anonymously determine how much time users spend on each page of our Site, how users navigate throughout the Site and how we may tailor our web pages to better meet the needs of users. This information may be used to improve our Site and Service or to share with business partners.

Your browser stores the information on your hard drive and when you return to that web site later, the cookie is transmitted back to the server that originally sent it to you. Cookies provide a way for a server to recall a previous request or previous registration, or to keep track of a transaction as it progresses, so that information does not have to be repeated. To be notified when you are about to receive a cookie, you can configure your browser to alert you when a web site is attempting to send you a cookie and at that time you will have the option of refusing the cookie.
