About myLot Privacy
This policy explains how myLot treats personal information that myLot collects and receives when an individual becomes a myLot member. Personal information is information that is personally identifiable like your name, birth date, or email address, some of which is publicly displayed.
This policy applies only to myLot and does not apply to the practices of companies that myLot does not own or control or to people that myLot does not employ or manage. In addition, certain myLot associated companies have their own privacy statements which can be viewed by going to their websites.

Once you register with myLot and sign in to our services, any data you provide, with the exception of your email address, may potentially be displayed to other myLot members and the public as a whole.
Security

It will be clear at the point of collection who is collecting the personal information and whose privacy statement will apply.
