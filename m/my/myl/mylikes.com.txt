Information Sharing
MyLikes does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or non-affiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or when we respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. If MyLikes becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
MyLikes may combine information we obtain from business partners or other companies, such as our social media partners, with information MyLikes has collected about you in order to serve you better or optimize the functions of the Service.
