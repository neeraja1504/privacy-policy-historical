The Use of Cookies
TURSS uses "cookies," which are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer's hard disk for record keeping and tracking purposes, to track and facilitate your access to our products and services. TURSS uses cookies in accordance with industry-standard protocols, and does not use cookies, either directly or in conjunction with other websites, to track your movement to websites other than SmartMove. If you would like more information about cookies, you can visit http://www.cookiecentral.com/n_cookie_faq.htm. TURSS uses a type of session cookie that is needed so that we can process each step of your transactions with us. If you refuse to accept this type of cookie, you will not be able to access our products and services. Most web browsers automatically delete this type of cookie when you terminate your session. TURSS is not configured to recognize browser "do not track" settings and, as such, setting this parameter in a user's browser does not impact site functionality. We may use third-party companies to serve ads on our site or on other sites which we use for advertising, track your movement on SmartMove, or deliver ads from other sites. These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness; and they are not authorized to use the information we share with them for any other purpose. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous. If you would like more information about this practice and your choices, click here. Like many websites, we use retargeting, a cookie-based technology, to provide advertisements that we think our site visitors may like. Retargeting works by placing an anonymous pixel in your browser when you visit the site. The pixel ensures that our ads are served only to people who have previously visited our sites.
