Web Site Use Information
Similar to other commercial websites, Keyport utilizes a standard technology called "cookies" and web server logs to collect information about how our website is used. Information gathered through cookies and web server logs may include the date and time of visits, pages viewed, time spent on our site, and the website visited just before and just after visiting our website.
Cookies
A "cookie" is a small text file that a Web site can place on your computer's hard drive in order, for example, to collect information about your activities on the site or to make it easier to use certain site functions. The cookie transmits this information back to the Web site's computer. Many users do not know that "cookies" are being placed on their computers when they visit Web sites. If you want to know when this happens, or prevent it from happening, you can set your browser to warn you when a Web site attempts to place a "cookie" on your computer.
Cookies allow you to place an order on our website and allow us to enhance and personalize your online surfing and shopping experience. For example, we use cookies to:
· Remember the items in your shopping basket
· Recognize you when you return to our website
· Analyze visitor behavior
Web Site Analytics
We also use cookies to analyze how visitors, in the aggregate, use our website, in order to make our website as useful as possible for them. We do not use cookies to collect or store personally identifiable information. We may also use a third party web analytics service provider that uses cookies and web beacons to help us analyze how users use this website and the effectiveness of our marketing search terms. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website (including, without limitation, your IP address) may be transmitted to and stored by this service provider. They may use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of our website and compiling aggregated reports for us. The information collected by our service provider and provided to us is not personally identifiable.

Third Parties
We may choose to work with other companies who use tracking technologies to serve ads on our behalf across the internet. These companies may collect non-personally identifiable information about your visit to our website and your interaction with our communications, including advertising.
We may also enter into alliances, partnerships or other business arrangements with third parties who may be given access to personal information including your name, address, telephone number and email for the purpose of providing you information regarding products and services that we think will be of interest to you. In connection with alliances, partnerships or arrangements, we may also provide certain information to third parties if we have determined that the information will be used in a responsible manner by a responsible third party. For example, some of our partners operate stores or provide services on our site, while others power offerings developed by us for your use. We also use third parties to facilitate our business, including, but not limited to, sending email and processing credit card payments. In connection with these offerings and business operations, our partners and other third parties may have access to your personal information for use in connection with business activities. As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings. Customer, email, and visitor information is generally one of the transferred business assets in these types of transactions. We may also transfer such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or any dissolution.
