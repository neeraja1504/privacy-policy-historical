Web servers hosting MyNewsLA.com automatically collect anonymous information about which pages you visit, your browser type, IP address,  domain name, interaction with advertising and other data. This is used for internal review, to tailor information to individual visitors and for traffic audits. We also provide this information about our users on an aggregated, anonymous basis to our advertisers.

For example, cookies are used to ensure that you don’t see the same ad too many times.
Advertising that is part of a network advertising service that collects information about a consumer’s online activities on a website over time and across different websites is identified by a small Ad Choices symbol. This symbol is part of the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. You can click the symbol for information about why and how you are receiving a particular ad, and the effect of your choice to allow or not allow tracking for targeted ads. For more information see www.aboutads.info.
Note that due to inconsistent and changing technology we cannot always honor a browser’s Do Not Track signal. You may opt-out of a network advertising service ad by changing your cookie settings.
