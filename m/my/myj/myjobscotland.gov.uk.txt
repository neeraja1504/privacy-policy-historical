Privacy Statement
Updated 29 th January 2019
This website is operated and controlled by the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities [COSLA] on behalf of its member organisations. myjobscotland is the national shared recruitment portal for Scotland's 32 local authorities, the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, and Further & Higher Education institutions. It advertises job vacancies online through a single internet portal managed by COSLA. The portal allows candidates in any location to view vacancies and submit applications online to the organisation advertising the vacancy. Candidates may also register to receive job alerts via email should they wish to do so. This policy is designed to inform you of COSLA's commitment to upholding your right to privacy and how COSLA will handle your personal data when you use myjobscotland.gov.uk
Information you supply will be processed by COSLA in accordance with the requirements and principles of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Data Protection Act 2018.
COSLA is registered with the Information Commissioner as a data controller under the following address and registration number: Convention Of Scottish Local Authorities, Verity House, 19 Haymarket Yards, Edinburgh EH12 5BH - Registration No: Z6216554
COSLA is the data controller in relation to the myjobscotland registration database and/or if you apply for a job specifically advertised by COSLA.
Legal basis for using your information
The legal basis for processing information relating to user registration is:
necessary for the performance of a contract with the individual (i.e. providing a user with access to the myjobscotland website, responding to user queries/issues relation to a registered account) and/or;
legitimate interests (i.e. administration of the website)
In the case of recruitment where COSLA is listed as the recruiting organisation, COSLA remains the data controller and will process your personal information as necessary to take steps to potentially enter into a contract with you.
Who do we share your information with?
Information entered onto the myjobscotland website is stored in a database (e-recruitment solution called TalentLink) managed by SabaÂ on COSLA's behalf.
The organisation to which you are applying is given limited access to this database (TalentLink), in order to process your application for a vacancy.
Once the closing date has been reached all submitted application information will be made available to the organisation to which you have applied, and they are obligated to handle your data in accordance with their policy.
No incomplete application information is visible/available to COSLA or the recruiting organisation.
At the point of submission the recruiting organisation becomes the data controller. To view the organisation privacy notices go to the organisation privacy notices page.
Application forms and personal data
If you choose to apply for a vacancy with one of the organisations featured on the website, the following information will be requested from you.
Contact information e.g. your name, address, email, contact telephone number
A description of your work experience, skills and education
Responses to specific application questions
Details of interview assessments
Equal Opportunity monitoring information
Any supplementary information you choose to support your application e.g. qualifying documents
Once you have submitted an application it is centrally stored on an e-recruitment database (TalentLink - e-recruitment solution provided by Saba) and will be accessible to the recruiting organisation.
This information will be used solely for the purposes of recruitment by the HR/recruitment/personnel department of that organisation. It will be made clear to you at the point of submitting your application which organisation will have access to your data.
By not submitting an application, by withdrawing an application, or by request that your application or account is deleted, you are opting out of the recruitment process.
How long do we keep your information for?
If you have registered an account but haven't activated it (using the activation link emailed to you at the point of registering) your account will be labelled inactive and will be automatically deleted from the myjobscotland registration database (platform - Drupal) after 6 months.
If you have registered an account and activated it, and have submitted an application(s) via your account, the data will be anonymised/archived, by removing personal details such as your name, address, email, contact telephone number, after five years of inactivity on your account. Inactivity is denoted as having not submitted an application form, and the status hasn't been changed to In Process, within a five year timeframe.
Accounts cannot be unarchived after this period. Therefore the onus is on you to keep your account active should you wish to continue to access your application information, and to keep copies of your submitted applications.
Successful candidate information will be retained on the e-recruitment database (TalentLink) for seven years.
If you are not offered a job, in accordance with the above, your application information will remain on your account until it is archived, or unless you request for it to be deleted.
Each organisation may have their own data retention policies so please check with the recruiting organisation. To view the organisation privacy notices go to the organisation privacy notices page.
COSLA will not sell or rent your personal information to third parties. We may make information available to tax and law enforcement agencies, as required or permitted by law.
Saba (who provide TalentLink) also apply a retention policy on data backups to ensure data is not retained longer than can reasonably anticipated and is required for service operation. Daily backups are secured, stored and recycled for up to 6 months. All backups are encrypted and/or held on encrypted storage for the retention period.
Your rights under data protection law
Access to your information - You have the right to request a copy of the personal information about you that we hold.
Correcting your information - We want to make sure that your personal information is accurate, complete and up to date. You can update your personal details via your myjobscotland account, and reapply for the same position up to the point of a position closing (as determined by the closing date). Once an application has been completed you may ask the recruiting organisation directly to correct any personal information about you that you believe does not meet these standards. The contact information for recruiting organisations is available here.
Deletion of your information - You have the right to ask us to delete personal information about you where: i. You consider that we no longer require the information for the purposes for which it was obtained ii. You have validly objected to our use of your personal information iii. Our use of your personal information is contrary to law or other legal obligations
Account deletion - right to be forgotten
At any point you can request the removal of your personal data from the myjobscotland registration database and e-recruitment system, by emailing myjobscotland@cosla.gov.uk. Please provide the email address you used when registering an account.
You will then be contacted by a member of the myjobscotland team based at COSLA and asked a number of security questions to ensure the validity of your request.
If you request that your account is deleted that will also include the deletion of all applications associated with that account.
Once your account has been deleted by COSLA (from the registration database and e-recruitment system) we recommend that you contact each individual organisation, to whom you have applied, to request that they also delete any data they might hold about you in relation to their recruitment process, since they are the data controllers at the point of submitting an application and they might handle your data out with the e-recruitment system e.g. print off application for shortleeting/shortlisting etc.
To view the organisation privacy notices go to the organisation privacy notices page.
Right of access - Subject Access Requests
Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Data Protection Act 2018, you can make a subject access request for the personal information held about you, subject to certain limitations.
COSLA is the data controller in relation to the myjobscotland registration database. If you would like to submit a subject access request, please submit a request in writing or by email. Email: myjobscotland@cosla.gov.uk Address: Data Protection Manager, COSLA, Verity House, 19 Haymarket Yards, Edinburgh EH12 5BH.
Once you submit an online application to a council/organisation using the myjobscotland website, the recruiting council/organisation becomes the data controller. You can find out information on how each council/organisation collects and processes your information via the Council/Organisation Privacy Notice page.
If you would like to submit a subject access request regarding any submitted applications (personal data and other supplementary information) during the recruitment process, please submit a request in writing or by email to the relevant council(s)/organisation(s) to whom you have applied. Go to the Contact Us section of the website for links to the relevant council/organisation contact details.

Advertising
The Council Advertising Network [CAN] is responsible for delivering external advertising on the myjobscotland.gov.uk website.
Please take a moment to read their privacy policy which includes cookie information and details on how to opt out individually to their advertising partners: https://can-digital.net/can-privacy-policy/
By default no adverts appear on the myjobscotland website.
On your myjobscotland account you can opt in and/or out of seeing targeted adverts at any time. Log in to your myjobscotland account > click on Account Settings > select a response against the question 'Do you want to see targeted adverts on our site?'
When you save your account settings this decision is recorded. In turn this will prevent the consent management solution (banner at the bottom of the screen) from being displayed whenever you are logged in, regardless of which browser or machine you are using.
In addition, upon saving your settings a cookie is set (called MJSAds) that records your decision. It is recorded on the browser you are using for one year. This prevents the consent management solution from being shown when you are not logged in, but when you are viewing the site with the same browser.
Upon clicking 'Accept' on the consent management solution (banner at the bottom of the screen) a cookie is set (called MJSAds) which prevents the banner from being shown, and displays adverts for one year.
Upon clicking 'Options' > 'Dismiss' at the end of the consent management solution screens (banner at the bottom of the screen) a cookie is set (called MJSAds) which prevents the banner and any adverts from being shown for the remainder of your session (i.e. until you close your browser).
WebChoices Tool: The WebChoices tool provides a list of over 130 internet advertisers and advertising technology companies. You can choose individual advertisers or can opt of all interest-based or behavioural advertising using the tool. You can opt out directly via the WebChoices website at: http://optout.aboutads.info/.
Please note that using WebChoices or a direct opt out link to opt out will not prevent advertising from being displayed on your browser. It will, however, stop advertisers from providing interest-based or behavioural advertising so you will see advertising that is not targeted/tailored to your browsing history.
