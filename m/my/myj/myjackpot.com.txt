7. Social Media Plugins
Facebook
Embedded on our website are various Facebook links. This web presence is operated exclusively by Facebook Inc., 1601 S California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA (Facebook). Within the scope of our web presence, these links are identified by the Facebook logo or by the phrase 'Like' (no Facebook plugins are used).
Should a user click one of these links, then the Facebook plugins are activated and establish a direct connection via the user's browser to a Facebook server.
Provided that the user clicks one of the aforementioned links while visiting our website, and is logged into their personal Facebook account, the information will be forwarded to Facebook that the user has visited our website. Facebook can associate your visit to the website to your account. This data is transferred to and saved by Facebook. To prevent this, the user must log out of their account before clicking the link. The functions embedded in the links by Facebook, especially the transfer of data and user information, are not activated by visiting our website, but rather by clicking the corresponding links.
The purpose and scope of data collection via Facebook, the processing and use of such data, as well as your rights thereof and personal settings regarding privacy protection can be found in the Facebook privacy settings section (http://de­de.facebook.com/privacy/explanation.php ).
For further questions pertaining to the collection, processing or use of individual user data, as well as regarding disclosing, correcting, blocking or deleting data, please contact our data protection supervisors.
Google Plus
Our web presence also employs the Google Plus "+1" link, which is operated by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States (Google). The link can be identified by the "+1" symbol against a white or color background.
If the user opens one of our websites containing such a link, the user's browser establishes a direct connection to a Google server. The contents of the "+1" link are transferred directly to your browser, which then integrates said content in the webpage. We therefore have no control over the data whatsoever that Google collects via the link, but would expect user IP addresses to be collected.
The purpose and scope of data collection via Google, the processing and use of such data, as well as your rights thereof and personal settings regarding privacy protection can be found in the Google privacy settings section http://www.google.com/intl/de/+/policy/+1button.html If a user is a Google Plus member and does not wish to have their data collected and linked to their saved Google member data via our web presence, the the user must log out of their Google Plus account before visiting our websites.
