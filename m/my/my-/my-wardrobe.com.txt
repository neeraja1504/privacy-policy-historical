Delivery Processing Time
Before we can send your order, we may need to confirm your details with your card issuer. We will do our best to keep delays to a minimum.
Our delivery time starts from the moment an order is accepted and includes a 48-hour period where your items will be processed and dispatched.
While we aim to ensure that all orders are received when expected, delivery to a remote destination is not always guaranteed to arrive within the specified shipping timeframe.
We work closely with our shipping partner to minimize the potential impact of delays to our international customers. However, we are not responsible for any custom clearance delays.
Delivery Insurance
You can rest assured that we'll keep your purchases safe until they've reached you - promise! Your order is insured against theft and accidental damage during delivery. Once your purchases have been delivered to the specified address and signed for, they are no longer covered by insurance.
If you have specified a recipient that is not you for delivery purposes (for example, as a gift), you accept that a signature by that person (or someone at their delivery address) is evidence of delivery. This signature is also evidence of fulfillment of your order by THE OUTNET and transfers the responsibility of your purchased goods to you.
Product Restrictions
As THE OUTNET has to follow international trading agreements and regulations, we're unable to dispatch items made of exotic skins outside the EU. Fine jewelry of certain compositions and products made in China are also not allowed to be shipped to some countries.
When a restricted item is added to your shopping bag, the site will automatically prompt you to remove it if we're unable to ship to the location you've selected. If you still wish to proceed with your order, you will need to have it delivered to a different destination address.
Russian Delivery Information
We are currently unable to dispatch orders containing jewelry to Russia. In order to receive your jewelry purchases, we suggest that you arrange for your shipment to be delivered to an alternative destination.

When a restricted item is added to your shopping bag, the website will prompt you to remove it if we're unable to ship to the location you've selected. If you still wish to proceed with your order, we suggest you have it delivered to a different destination address. In the case of exotic skins, this would need to be within the EU.

Orders shipped to Europe are charged in Euros and all other destinations are billed in British Pounds.

Our delivery time starts from the moment an order is placed and include a 48 hour period where your items will be processed and dispatched by our warehouse.

COOKIE POLICY
This website is owned and run by THE NET-A-PORTER GROUP LIMITED ("we", "our", "us"), part of YOOX NET-A-PORTER GROUP. If we use the term "our Group", this means us and our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries (or any of them). The term "our online services" refers to NET-A-PORTER, MR PORTER, THE OUTNET, The NET SET, our mobile and tablet applications and any other websites or apps we own or run from time to time.

Third-party cookies
The cookies used on our online services
The cookies we and our business partners use on our online services can be grouped into the following categories:
Essential cookies : Some of the cookies on our online services are essential for us to be able to provide you with a service you have requested. An example of this would be a cookie that enables you to log into your account on the website, or one which allows communication between your browser and the website. Our cookie-preference cookie, described in the section 'How to reject or opt out of receiving cookies', is also an essential cookie. You may not be able to use our website without these cookies.
Website functionality cookies : These cookies enable you to browse our online services and use features such as shopping baskets and wish lists.
Website analytics cookies : We use these cookies to measure and analyse how our customers use our online services. An example is counting the number of different people visiting our website or using a particular feature, rather than the total number of times the site or feature is used. This allows us to continuously improve our online services and your shopping experience.
Customer preference cookies : When browsing or shopping online, our online services will remember preferences you make (for example your user name, language or location). This improves your experience and makes your browsing simpler, easier and more personal to you.
Social sharing cookies : We use cookies to allow you to share content directly on social networking/sharing sites like Instagram, Facebook and Twitter. Examples would be if you wanted to 'like' or 'tweet' about a product advertised on our online services.
Interest-based advertising cookies : You will have noticed, when visiting other websites, that you are shown adverts for products and services you may wish to buy. The money made by website owners for showing third-party adverts on their websites often pays for the cost of running the website, and therefore often allows you to use the website without having to pay a registration or usage fee. Like many businesses, we place adverts for our services on a range of our partners' websites. However, to try and ensure that the adverts you see are relevant to you, we use cookies to collect information about the types of things that interest you, for example websites you visit and your geographic location. Having these cookies does not increase the number of adverts you will be shown, but simply makes the adverts you see more relevant. In addition, they limit the number of times you see an advertisement, as well as helping us measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns.
Advertising cookies used on our business partners' websites : We place adverts on a number of third-party websites. We use cookies to control how often you are shown a particular advert on those websites, so you do not see the same advert too frequently. We do not collect any personal data within these cookies. To reject our use of these cookies, please refer to your browser settings as set out in the 'How to reject or opt out of receiving cookies' section below.
How to reject or opt out of receiving cookies : If you want to delete any cookies that are already on your computer, please refer to the help and support section on your internet browser for instructions on how to locate the file or directory that stores cookies. Please note that our online services cannot always control third-party cookies stored on your machine from our online services and that setting your cookie preferences with us will not stop those third-party cookies from being stored on your machine. Therefore you must manage these cookies directly with the relevant third party. Please see our 'Third party cookies' section below for more information. Information on deleting or controlling cookies is available at www.AboutCookies.org. Please note that by deleting our cookies or disabling future cookies you may not be able to access certain areas or features of our site.
Third-party cookies : Some of the cookies described above are stored on your machine by third parties when you use our online services. We have no control over these cookies or how the third parties use them. They are used to allow third parties to provide a service to us, for example analytics. For more information on these cookies and how to disable them, please see the individual third party's privacy policy listed below.

Please read the TOS carefully before placing any orders on www.theoutnet.com. We recommend you should keep a copy of the TOS for future reference.

If you are under 16 you must let your parent or guardian know about THE OUTNET's Privacy Policy before you register to use this Site or any of this Site's services. We reserve the right to only accept orders from those over 18 however.
We may modify the TOS from time to time. Please read the TOS and check back often. If you do not agree to any change to the TOS then you must immediately stop using the Site. Any changes made after you have placed an order will not affect that order unless we are required to make the change by law.
Registration
To use some of the services or features made available to you on this Site, you will need to register. When you register you are required to provide information about yourself that is true, accurate, current and complete in all respects. Should any of your registration information change, please notify us immediately at the following e-mail address customercare@theoutnet.com. We may also change registration requirements from time to time.
The account password you provide should be unique and kept secure, and you must notify THE OUTNET immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.
Please refer to our Privacy Policy for information about how we use your data.
Eligibility to purchase
In order to make purchases on the Site you will be required to provide your personal details. In particular, you must provide your real name, phone number, e-mail address and other requested information as indicated. Furthermore, you will be required to provide payment details that you represent and warrant are both valid and correct and you confirm that you are the person referred to in the Billing information provided.
The Site is available only to individuals and others who meet THE OUTNET terms of eligibility, who have been issued a valid credit/debit card by a bank acceptable to THE OUTNET, whose applications are acceptable THE OUTNET and who have authorized THE OUTNET to process a charge or charges on their credit/debit card in the amount of the total purchase price for the merchandise which they purchase. Products purchased by the buyer are for personal or gift use and should not be re-sold, used for commercial purposes or any other commercial benefit. In addition, THE OUTNET reserves the right to restrict multiple quantities of an item being shipped to any one customer or postal address.
By making an offer to purchase merchandise, you expressly authorize us to perform credit checks, and where THE OUTNET feels necessary, to transmit or to obtain information (including any updated information) about you to or from third parties, including but not limited to your credit/debit card number or credit reports (including credit reports for your spouse if you reside in a community property jurisdiction), to authenticate your identity, to validate your credit/debit card, to obtain an initial credit/debit card authorization and to authorize individual purchase transactions.
Furthermore, you agree that we may use Personal Information provided by you in order to conduct appropriate anti fraud checks. Personal Information that you provide may be disclosed to a credit reference or fraud prevention agency, which may keep a record of that information.
Please refer to our Privacy Policy for further information about how we use your data.
Orders
THE OUTNET offers products for sale that are in stock and available for dispatch from our distribution center. All orders are sold on a first come, first served basis and are subject to acceptance and availability.
Please note that items in your shopping basket are not reserved and may be purchased by other customers. When participating in 'Clearance sales' customers must complete the check out procedure within the specified timeframes.
Please see our Promotions for more information.
THE OUTNET will store a record of your transactions for a minimum of one year.
Pricing policy
Prices shown on the site are in GBP or Euros and are inclusive of VAT at the applicable rate unless you have selected an alternative country where VAT is not chargeable, as indicated in the top left hand corner of the Site.
From time to time, prices are subject to change in response to currency exchange rate changes, markdowns and other commercial factors. The price applicable to your order will be the price current at the time your order is accepted.
All prices and offers remain valid as advertised from time to time. The GBP or Euros price of a product displayed on the Site at the time the order is accepted will be honored, except in cases of patent error.
All prices remain static for the duration of the selling period (apart from Promotion events) allowing for a stable environment in which customers can shop globally.
Customers buying from outside the UK will also incur carriage costs and any duties levied by the jurisdiction to which you have specified delivery. If you are a customer whose credit/debit card is not denominated in Sterling or Euros, the final price will be calculated in accordance with the applicable exchange rate on the day your card issuer processes the transaction.
Promotions
Participation in Clearance sales and weekly promotions is subject to the following terms and conditions:
CLEARANCE SALES
Clearance sales are open to all registered customers.
Customers must be registered with the International Site to participate in International Clearance sales.
All items are sold on a first come, first served basis and must be purchased before the timer expires.
PROMOTION CODES
Promotion codes are non-transferable and there is no cash alternative. Furthermore, they cannot be used in conjunction with any other promotion code or offers, and must be redeemed by the date published, if provided.
Refer a friend
As of February 28, 2017, the Refer a Friend program is no longer available.
Any Store credit you have remaining from this program is valid for 12 months from the date of receipt and is only redeemable on THE OUTNET.
To stay up to date on the latest designer arrivals, promotions and more, make sure you’re registered for an account to receive our email updates.
Acceptance of your order
Once you have made your choice and your order has been placed, you will receive an email acknowledging the details of your order. This email is NOT an acceptance of your order, just a confirmation that we have received it.
Unless you cancel your order, acceptance of your order and completion of the contract between you and THE OUTNET will be completed when we email you to confirm the goods have been dispatched. The sale contract is therefore concluded in London, England and the language of the contract is English. Neither our third party payment processor nor our nominated courier has the authority to accept an order on behalf of THE OUTNET.
We reserve the right not to accept your order in the event, for example, that we are unable to obtain authorization for payment, that shipping restrictions apply to a particular item, that the item ordered is out of stock or does not satisfy our quality control standards and is withdrawn, or that you do not meet the eligibility criteria set out within the TOS.
We may also refuse to process and therefore accept a transaction for any reason or refuse service to anyone at any time at our sole discretion. We will not be liable to you or any third party by reason of our withdrawing any merchandise from the Site whether or not that merchandise has been sold, removing, screening or editing any materials or content on the Site, refusing to accept a transaction or unwinding or suspending any transaction after processing has begun.
Whilst every effort is made to make sure details on our website are accurate, we may from time to time discover an error in the pricing of products. If we discover an error in the pricing of a product in your order, we will let you know as soon as possible. We shall be under no obligation to accept or fulfil an order for a product that was advertised at an incorrect price and reserve the right to cancel such an order that has been accepted or is in transit. If you order a product that is priced incorrectly for any reason, we will email or telephone you to inform you that we have not accepted your order and/or that the relevant part of your order has been cancelled. If you have already paid for the goods, we shall refund the full amount as soon as we are able. In the event that products are recalled in transit, we will process your refund once the products have been returned to us.
Payment
Payment can be made by Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Maestro and JCB cards, and any other methods which may be clearly advertised on the Site from time to time. You can also choose to pay with PayPal. When selecting this option at checkout, you will be directed to the PayPal site to 'Log In' and review the amount shown before clicking 'Pay Now'. Once this transaction is complete, you will then return to THE OUTNET. Payment will be debited and cleared from your account upon completion of the packing of your order by THE OUTNET. You confirm that the credit/debit card that is being used is yours or that you have been specifically authorized by the owner of the credit/debitncard to use it. All credit/debit card holders are subject to validation checks and authorization by the card issuer. If the issuer of your payment card refuses to authorize payment to THE OUTNET, we will not be liable for any delay or non-delivery.
We take reasonable care to make our Site secure. All credit/debit card transactions on this site are processed using Datacash, a secure online payment gateway that encrypts your card details in a secure host environment. If you are a registered THE OUTNET user, we will securely store your credit/debit card details on our systems. These details will be fully encrypted and only used to process card transactions which you have initiated.
To help ensure that your shopping experience is safe, simple and secure THE OUTNET uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.
Furthermore, we will take reasonable care, in so far as it is in our power to do so, to keep the details of your order and payment secure, but in the absence of negligence on our part we cannot be held liable for any loss you may suffer if a third party procures unauthorized access to any data you provide when accessing or ordering from the Site.
Gift Cards
Gift Cards are no longer available to purchase.
If you still have a Gift Card to redeem, enter your Gift Card code in the promotional box at checkout and the balance will be deducted from the final price. Please note that any existing Gift Cards are valid for six months from date of purchase.
For assistance redeeming your credit, please contact Customer Care.
Insurance and delivery
You will own the goods on and from the later of the point in time when: (a) we receive payment in full, or (b) we deliver the goods to you.
THE OUTNET insures each purchase during the time it is in transit until it is delivered to your specified delivery address. We require a signature for any goods delivered, at which point responsibility for your purchased goods passes to you. If you have specified a recipient who is not you for delivery purposes (for example as a gift) then you accept that evidence of a signature by them (or at that delivery address) is evidence of delivery and fulfilment by THE OUTNET and transfer of responsibility in the same way. The goods are your responsibility from the time we deliver them to the address you gave us.
Please note that we aim to dispatch all orders within 48 hours. Delivery times appearing on the Site are estimates and are to be used as a guide only and commence from the date of dispatch. In any event, we will deliver the goods to you within 30 days of the day on which we accept your order. THE OUTNET is not responsible for any delays caused by destination customs clearance processes.
If delivery is delayed by any event outside of our control, we will contact you as soon as possible to let you know and we will take steps to minimize the effect of the delay. Provided we do this, we will not be liable for delays caused by the event, but if there is a risk of substantial delay you may contact us to cancel your order and we will give you a refund for any goods you have paid for but not received.
Cancellations, Returns and Exchanges
CANCELLING YOUR ORDER UNDER THE CONSUMER CONTRACTS (INFORMATION, CANCELLATION AND ADDITIONAL CHARGES) REGULATIONS 2013
If you are based in the EU under the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013 (ICACRs), you have the right to cancel your order with us provided you give us written notice.
Right to Cancel under the ICACRs
You have the right to cancel your order within 14 days without giving any reason.
The cancellation period will expire 14 days from the day after the day on which you (or someone you nominate, other than a carrier) receives the last of the goods.
To exercise the right to cancel, you must inform us by letter to: Notice of Contract Cancellation, Customer Care Department, THE OUTNET DC1, Unit 3, Charlton Gate Business Park, Anchor and Hope Lane, London SE7 7RU, or by email to: customercare@theoutnet.com. You may also use the cancellation form but it is not obligatory.
For orders cancelled under the ICACRs, we will issue you with a full refund including the shipping cost paid by you. We may make a deduction from the reimbursement for loss in value of any goods supplied, if the loss is the result of unnecessary handling by you.
We will make reimbursement without undue delay, and not later than:
(i) 14 days after the day we receive back from you any of the goods supplied; or
(ii) (if earlier) 14 days after the day you provide us with evidence that the good have been returned; or
(iii) if no goods were supplied, 14 days after the day on which we are informed about your cancellation.
We will make reimbursement using the same means of payment as you used for the initial transaction, unless you have expressly agreed otherwise; in any event, you will not incur any fees as a result of the reimbursement.
In the event that we have sent goods to you and you have cancelled your order, we may withhold reimbursement until we have received the goods back or you have supplied evidence of having sent the goods back, whichever is the earliest. If we do not receive the cancelled goods back, we may arrange to have them collected from you at your cost.
You shall return cancelled orders to: THE OUTNET.COM, Unit 4, Old Parkbury Lane, Colney Street, St Albans, Hertfordshire, AL2 2DZ, United Kingdom, without undue delay and in any event not later than 14 days from day on which you communicate your cancellation of the contract to us. The deadline is met if you send the goods before the period of 14 days has expired.
You will have to bear the cost of returning the goods.
You are only liable for any diminished value of the goods resulting from the handling, other than what is necessary to establish the nature, characteristics and functioning of the goods.
Please note you may only use your right to cancel the order under the ICASRs if you give us formal written notice of cancellation any time after your order has been placed, up until 14 calendar days from the day after you receive your order, by email or post as described above, i.e. before requesting a return through your account.
Our FREE COLLECTIONS SERVICE (see below) is not available for orders cancelled under the ICACRs.
RETURNS AND EXCHANGES USING OUR FREE COLLECTION SERVICE
As an alternative to using your rights under the ICACRs, you may prefer to return or exchange items using our free returns and exchanges collection service. You must have your purchase sent back to us within 28 days of receipt, for a refund of the value of the item only, or an exchange for the same item in a different size, based on stock availability. If you wish to exchange your item for an alternative product, we suggest that you return it for a store credit and purchase the new item separately.
Please refer to our Returns & Exchanges policy for further information.
Shipping is complementary on the replacement item, but exchanges made to destinations outside of the EU will be processed for customs clearance and therefore any relevant import duty and tax charges will apply. If you selected PayPal when you placed your order, any applicable taxes and duties on your exchange should be paid with your debit or credit card. See costs for Shipping and Returns.
Please note our free collection service is not available for orders cancelled under the ICACRs.
OUR POLICY
Items should be returned unused, and with all THE OUTNET and designer garment tags still attached. Returns that are damaged or soiled will not be accepted and will be sent back to the customer and/or a refund refused.
Where provided, belts and any designer packaging such as authenticity cards, dust bags and leather tags should be included with your return.
Please email customercare@theoutnet.com if any of your purchases have been delivered without THE OUTNET tags.
You will need to inform us before you return a purchase. Unidentified items will be returned to the sender.
LATE RETURNS
Please seek to return the items within 28 days of receiving your order. Please note that returns requested outside of this period will be granted at our discretion.
SHOES
All shoes should be tried on a carpeted surface before wear.
LINGERIE & SWIMWEAR
Briefs, swimming costumes and bikini bottoms should be tried on over underwear, without removing the protective adhesive strip. Returns will not be accepted if this strip has been removed or if items are soiled, and will be sent back to the customer.
FAULTY GOODS
Goods are faulty if they are received damaged or where a manufacturing fault occurs within six months of purchase. Items that are damaged as a result of normal wear and tear are not considered to be faulty.
If your item is faulty when you receive it, you can return it for a refund. Simply request a return and have the faulty goods sent back to us within 30 days of the day you received them.
If you discover a fault after this time, but within six months of purchase, you can still return it. Where possible, we will offer to repair the item. If it cannot be repaired and the same product is still available, we will send you a replacement. If the same product is no longer available, you are entitled to a full refund.
If you would like to exchange a faulty item instead of obtaining a refund, please be aware that we can only replace it for the same product in the same size, subject to availability.
COLORS
We have made every effort to display as accurately as possible the colors of our products that appear on the Site. However, as computer monitors vary, we cannot guarantee that your monitor's display of any color will be completely accurate.
REPEATED RETURNS
We offer a flexible returns policy to make your online shopping experience even easier. However, we do monitor the number of returns made and may refuse to accept orders at our discretion if goods are returned repeatedly.
