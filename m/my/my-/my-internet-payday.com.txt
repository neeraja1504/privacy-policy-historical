1.5 Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected using Technology.
InfoMedia, Inc. currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about an individual with information about the individual in our database. Additionally, InfoMedia, Inc. may use other new and evolving sources of information in the future (together, "Technology Information").
a. Cookies.
A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individual's computer that allows InfoMedia, Inc.. to identify the individual with his or her corresponding data that resides in InfoMedia, Inc.'s database. You may read more about cookies at http://cookiecentral.com . Individuals who use the Websites need to accept cookies in order to use all of the features and functionality of the Websites.
b. Web Beacons.
A web beacon is programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page (by using an programming function -- see http://truste.org for more information), but can also be used to transfer an individual's unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows InfoMedia, Inc. to track certain websites an individual visits online. Web beacons are used to determine products or services an individual may be interested in, and to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes. For example, InfoMedia, Inc. might place, with the consent of a Third Party website, a web beacon on the Third Party's website where cosmetics are sold. When Jane, an individual listed in InfoMedia, Inc.'s database, visits the cosmetic website, InfoMedia, Inc. receives notice by means of the web beacon that Jane visited the cosmetics site, and InfoMedia, Inc. would then update Jane's profile with the information that Jane is interested in cosmetics. InfoMedia, Inc. may thereafter present offers of cosmetic related products and services to Jane. In addition to using web beacons on web pages, InfoMedia, Inc. also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in InfoMedia, Inc.'s database.
c. New Technology.
The use of technology on the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly evolving, as is InfoMedia, Inc.'s use of new and evolving technology.
