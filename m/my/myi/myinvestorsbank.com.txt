Information We May Collect
Personal Information We May Collect Online
Personal Information means personally identifiable information such as information you provide via forms, surveys, applications or other online fields including but not limited to name, postal or email addresses, telephone or mobile numbers, or account numbers. Personal Information may also be obtained from third parties such as credit bureaus.

We also utilize cookies for advertising purposes. You can refuse to accept these cookies and most devices and browsers offer their own privacy settings for cookies. You will need to manage your cookie settings for each device and browser you use. However, if you do not accept these cookies, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of the Interface and some online products and services. For example, we will not be able to recognize your device and you will need to answer a challenge question each time you log on. You also may not receive tailored advertising or other offers from us that may be relevant to your interests and needs.

Third party widgets:  We may allow certain widgets (e.g., social share buttons) on our Interfaces that enable users to easily share information on another platform, such as a social media platform. The third parties that own these widgets may have access to information about your browsing on pages of our Interfaces where these widgets are placed.
