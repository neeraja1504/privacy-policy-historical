Your privacy is important to us. In the course of setting up your account we gather information including your name, address, phone number, alternative email contact information, and IP address.
AffordableDot.Com will not sell or otherwise release your personal information to any other party except in one of the following circumstances: 1) with your permission, 2) if we receive a court order, 3) to protect our rights and property, 4) in the event of an emergency to protect someone's personal safety, or 5) under a non-disclosure agreement with an investor (in which case only your name will be released, without contact information), and 6) to provide you with any services provided by another company which you have purchased through us such as secure certificate registration and domain name registration.
AffordableDot.Com reserves the right to contact you at any time to notify you of changes to service or to provide you with any information, which we feel, is relevant and important to your account at our discretion.
Your personal contact information is, however, available online through nearly any registrar if you have a domain name registered in your name. This is beyond our control. If you do not wish to release your phone number or wish to choose an alternate (permanent!!) email address for your domain name registration, please inform us at the time you register for an account.
You are responsible for ensuring that your contact information is kept up to date. In the event that we are unable to contact you for billing or security purposes your account may be deactivated pending contact from you and an update of our information. You may update your information with us through our online help desk, via email, or by phone.
If you cancel your account we will continue to provide the same level of protection for your personal information.
AffordableDot.Com reserves the right to make changes to this policy. Any such changes will become effective 30 days after notice of said changes is posted on our website, sent out via email, or sent out via postal mail, at our discretion.
