3.How and why personal information is used
This section explains how and why we use personal information.
3.1 Lawful Processing in Europe
As we collect and use personal information, the lawful bases we use for this activity in Europe, as required under European data protection laws, are:
Where it is necessary for entering into or performing a contract with you
Where we have a legitimate interest to do so, provided your rights do not override these interests
Where you have consented to its use
Where our colleagues believe it is in your vital interests to share your personal details, for example with emergency services
Where required to comply with our legal obligations
3.2 Product enquires, sales and administration
As part of a purchase, product enquiry, request for information and for account administration, we collect information such as your name, country, job title, company information or academic affiliation, postal address, e-mail address and telephone number.
If you have made an enquiry about us or our products or services, either online or over the phone, we will use your personal information to respond to the enquiry or to take other steps at your request, before you enter into a contract. For example, we collect the e-mail addresses and additional contact details of those who send e-mails to request information. Where a sales representative speaks to you over the phone, the calls may be recorded for training and monitoring purposes only.
If you have registered for or purchased a product or services, including on a trial basis, your personal information will be used to provide that product or service, communicate about it and handle payments, as is necessary for the performance of the contract entered into.
For purchases, payment information, including credit/debit card number/bank details and billing addresses are also collected. Where payment card processors are used to facilitate payment card transactions on our websites, your data will be collected and used according to that data processors’ privacy policy.
If your personal information is relevant to certain products and is freely available through public sources, such as on a website related to your work or profession, we may use this personal information for providing customers with our products, as part of our legitimate interests as a commercial organisation.
3.3 Event and Exhibition Management
If you have agreed to participate in one of our events as a speaker, sponsor, exhibitor or attendee, personal information is used in connection with the running of the event, to handle payments or for other purposes, as is necessary for performing the contract entered into. We will also use your personal information to maintain our databases, assess your qualities as a speaker or sponsor/exhibitor, promote events and encourage further engagement at our events, as part of the legitimate interests we have as a commercial organisation. At some of our events, your name badge may contain some of your personal information that you have provided to us, which may include your name, job title and company. When scanned, this information will be made available to us or the relevant exhibitor and processed in the manner as described above.
In addition, we sometimes take photos and videos at our events, which may feature attendees, speakers, sponsors or exhibitors. Where photos and videos are taken that feature you as an attendee, sponsor or exhibitor, we may use those photos and videos for promotional purposes.
3.4 Marketing
We will use your personal information to send you newsletters, offers or other marketing emails to keep you up to date with our news, events and products that may be of interest. Depending on the nature of your interaction with us and the laws of the country where you live, you may have actively given your consent for this by opting in or we may be entitled to rely to legitimate interests to contact you with relevant marketing information. The opportunity to opt out of future marketing emails will always be provided, and information on how to do this is given when your personal information is collected and on every marketing email sent. Further information on how you can change your marketing preferences is provided in the section 8 below.
3.5 Customer and Prospects Management (including Analytics and Product Development)
We may use your personal information and contact you to maintain our customer database in order to keep your information accurate and up-to-date; as well as to carry out internal analysis of the usage of our products and services, in order to improve them, develop new products and events and predict future customer behavior, as is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests as a commercial organisation. This may include automated profiling and campaign management techniques.
We may use the personal data we hold about you, combined with publicly available data and your demographic data to better understand our customers and to improve the products and services we deliver.
3.6 Mobile Applications and Website Analytics including location data
We may combine visitor session information, or other information collected through tracking technologies with personally identifiable information, to understand and measure your online experiences and determine what products, promotions and services are likely to be of interest.
Technical methods are also used in HTML e-mails sent to visitors, for purposes including: (i) to determine whether visitors have opened or forwarded e-mails and/or clicked on links in those e-mails, (ii) to customise the display of banner advertisements and other messages after closing an e-mail, and (iii) to determine whether a visitor has made an enquiry or a purchase in response to a particular e-mail.
In compliance with the California Online Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA) (e.g.: Browsers Do Not Track Signals) while we strive to offer you choice when using our website and mobile applications, we do not promise that we will be able to receive or honor web browser Do Not Track signals.
3.7 Bulletin Boards or Chat Areas
When you disclose personal information on any public bulletin board or chat areas of this website, or any other website used as a result of use of this website, such personal information can be collected and used by anyone who views that board or area. This may result in unsolicited messages from other participants or other parties, which we are not responsible for
Where you engage on our customer enquiry chat areas, we will use any information provided to help recommend our products and/or assist with confirming any order you wish to place.
3.8 Automated Decision-Making, Including Profiling
We use algorithm-based technologies to personalise dynamic web content based on your explicit and/or implicit interests. We carry out general profiling such as segmentation, non-automated and automated decision-making based on profiling for the purpose of providing you with a more relevant experience and for the purposes of our legitimate interests as a commercial organisation. Solely automated decision making is never used in any way that produce a legal or similarly significant effect.
Depending on the laws of the country where you live, you may have rights related to our decision. For example, if you live in the European Union, you may have the right not to be subject to our decision, or you may have the right to insist on human intervention in the process, express your point of view or contest the decision. To exercise any such right, contact us via one of the methods set out in section 10 below - Contacting Us. In some cases, we may have the right to continue with our decision, in accordance with applicable laws. This will be explained if it is the case. Otherwise, we will respond to your request as promptly as reasonably possible.
3.9 Compliance with our legal obligations
To ensure compliance with international trade sanction laws and regulations, we screen customers, vendors and suppliers against US, OFAC, BIS, UN, EU and UK sanctions lists. Should any screening checks flag an issue where we cannot continue in a contract with a customer or supplier, they will always be informed.

5. How we protect personal information
Any personal information given to us will be treated with the utmost care and security. This section sets out some of the security measures in place.
A variety of physical and technical measures are used to keep data safe and prevent unauthorised access to, or use or disclosure of personal information.
Electronic data and databases are stored on secure computer systems and we control who has access to information, using both physical and electronic means. Our colleagues receive data protection training, and we have detailed security and data protection policies that colleagues are required to follow when handling personal data.
All reasonable steps are taken to ensure that your personal information is kept secure from unauthorised access, but we cannot guarantee it will be secure during the transmission process to this website because this transmission is not controlled by us. We make use of HTTPS (HTTP Secure) whereby the communication protocol is encrypted via Transport Layer Security for secure communication over a computer network. The website is loaded via HTTPS, represented by the lock icon in your web browser, which ensures the transmission is secure and is demonstrated by a certificate issued by an official security certificate authority to us.
5.1 International transfer of personal information
As an international business and because of the technologies we use, personal information may be accessed by our colleagues and third-party service providers from locations outside of the European Economic Area, whose data protection laws may not be as extensive as those in Europe.
To ensure the same level of protection is in place when processing is conducted outside the European Economic Area, we use appropriate safeguards approved by the European Commission.
We apply appropriate protection to make sure your personal data remains adequately protected and is treated in line with this Privacy Policy. KNect365 has international data transfer agreements between its companies and with relevant third-party service providers based on standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission.
5.2 Cookies
We use cookies (small text files stored in your browser) and other techniques such as web beacons (small, clear picture files used to follow your movements on our website). These collect information that tells us how our websites, web-related products and services are used.
This, in turn, helps us make our website relevant to your interests and needs. We may use a persistent cookie (a cookie that stays linked to your browser) to record your details to recognise you if you visit our website again. For more information please visit our Cookie Policy.
5.3 Third-party links
This website contains links to other websites of event and media partners or customers’ companies and online assets and other businesses within Informa. These businesses will have their own privacy policies, tailored to their particular business practices and the sectors in which they operate, and if following those links, we recommend reviewing the privacy policy of each website to understand how personal data is used in that instance. The inclusion of links to these websites does not imply an endorsement or validation of their content, and we are not responsible for their privacy practices nor do we accept any liability in connection with the content on such websites.
We also do not take any responsibility for any posts or links posted on bulletin boards or chat areas on our websites (including any third-party links that may be posted).
