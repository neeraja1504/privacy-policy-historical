Privacy Statement - NASDAQ OMX
Effective Date: 04/21/2006
This Privacy Statement describes how your personal information is collected, used, shared, and safeguarded by NASDAQOMX.
Information Collection & Use
Uses of Information
NASDAQOMX uses the personally identifiable information you provide us to communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account. Any personally identifiable information gathered by NASDAQOMX will be used for internal purposes only. We will not disclose or divulge such data outside of NASDAQOMX.
Communications from the Site
Special Offers and Updates
We may occasionally send you information on NASDAQOMX products or services.
Out of respect for your privacy, we present the option not to receive these types of communications. Please see the “Choice and Opt-out."
Customer Service
Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we may send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password. We will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account. We will communicate with you by email or telephone, in accordance with your wishes.
Profile
We store information that we collect through cookies, log files, clear gifs, to create a “profile" of your preferences. On some web sites we will link your personally identifiable information to your web site actions, to information in the profile, in order to provide a more accurate understanding of the web sites usage.
Information Sharing and Disclosure
Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)
NASDAQOMX does not share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers, in ways that directly identify you.
Personally Identifiable Information
Legal Disclaimer
We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site
Choice/Opt-Out
If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by emailing us at the appropriate contact associated with each web site found in the contact section of this privacy statement below.
You will be notified when your personal information is collected by any third party that is not our agent/service provider, so you can make an informed choice as to whether or not to share your information with that party.
Log Files
As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.
We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
On certain websites we do link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information. IP addresses are tied to personally identifiable information to help identify individual web site usage.
Cookies
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. NASDAQOMX uses cookies on some of our websites. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.
We use both session ID cookies and/or persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close you browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help" file.
Some cookies contain the email address provided by you when completing an email profile for that site. This information is used to populate an email address box with your email address. Where appropriate some sites generate disclaimer/notice cookies to confirm that you have read and agreed to its terms of use. In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.
This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by all NASDAQOMX web sites and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. [See the “Third Party advertising " section.]
Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs/ Embedded Pixels)
In an effort to provide users with the most relevant Web site content, we may also use embedded pixel technologies to help track site usage, these technologies are used on selected pages for the purposes of identifying unique user visits as opposed to aggregate hits. The site usage information collected by these technologies is associated with cookies and may provide data about site use by registered users of NASDAQ OMX Web sites. This information is used to evaluate site content, navigability and composition as well as page response rates. Any data linking the information gathered by clear gifs to a user's personally identifiable information is used for internal tracking purposes only. We will not disclose or divulge such data linkages outside of NASDAQOMX. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. To learn more about our advertising company’s use of clear gifs, please go to http://www.omniture.com/
Links to Other Sites
This Web site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by NASDAQOMX. NASDAQOMX is not responsible for the privacy practices of non-NASDAQOMX web sites linked to a NASDAQOMX site. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of other linked web sites when you leave our Web site. This privacy statement applies only to information collected by this Web site.
Access to Personally Identifiable Information
If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may update or deactivate it by contacting us at the contact information listed below.
Security
NASDAQOMX takes reasonable precautions to protect your personal information. The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
Changes in this Privacy Statement
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.
