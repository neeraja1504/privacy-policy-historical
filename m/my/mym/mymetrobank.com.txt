Important Information About Procedures for Opening a New Account
To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. What this means for you: When you open an account, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask you to send a copy of your driver's license or other identifying documents.
Information We Collect
We collect non-public, personal information about you to help serve your financial needs, provide customer service, offer new products or services, and fulfill legal and regulatory requirements. These types of non-public, personal information may include:
Information we received from you on loan applications or other forms.
Information about your transactions with Metro Bank or others.
Information from outside companies or third parties, such as credit bureaus, motor vehicle reports and demographic information.
We collect only the information necessary to deliver quality products and services to our customers.
Information We Share
We are permitted by law to share non-public information about you with outside companies or non-affiliated, third parties that participate with us in supplying products and services to you, such as check printers. We are permitted, or required, by law to share your information with credit bureaus and government entities in responding to subpoenas and other legal processes, as well as those companies with whom you have requested us to share information.
These non-affiliated, third party companies are not permitted to use your information for any purposes other than the services intended. We will share your information with these companies only if they agree to treat it confidentially.
The type of information we may share is:
Information we receive from you on loan applications or other forms, such as name, address, social security number, assets and income.
Information about transactions with Metro Bank, such as account balances and payment history.
We may also disclose information we have about you to companies with whom we have joint marketing agreements or who provide marketing services on our behalf. We may share information about you with another financial institution to jointly offer financial services to you.
We do not sell, rent or otherwise provide customer information to outside companies so they can market non-financial services to you.
Metro Bank may make a decision to sell a particular line of business (for example, mortgage servicing rights). Usually, an integral part of that business is its customer database. Metro Bank reserves the right, in circumstances such as these, to transfer ownership of such customer databases to the purchaser. We do not share any non-public, personal information about our customers or former customers to anyone, except as permitted by law.
Online Protection
All of our Internet forms and pages with customer or other sensitive information are protected by data-encryption technology. Encryption is a procedure for turning plain text or other information into an unrecognizable pattern of data requiring a unique key to open or "decode" the formula. The unbroken key or closed lock on your screen indicates that the connection is secure.
Although we provide data encryption and other types of protection to maintain the security of our customers' information, there are certain security, corruption, transmission error and access-availability risks associated with using open networks such as the Internet. Should you decide at any time that you prefer not to use our online services, please visit any store or call us at 1-888-937-0004.
How We Handle E-Mail
Our website does not require you to disclose any personal identifying information. If, however, you choose to contact us via e-mail, please keep in mind that your e-mail address, and any other information your e-mail header shows about you, such as your name or organization, will be revealed to us in the e-mail. We pledge, however, that when you communicate with us via e-mail, we will use that information only to respond to the inquiry, provide accurate information to any questions, and in certain instances, assist in the resetting of passwords. Your e-mail address will not be sold, nor will it be shared with others outside of Metro Bank unless we are compelled to do so by law.
We want to be very clear: we will not obtain personally identifying information about you when you visit our site, unless you choose to provide such information to us.

No Data "Capture" With Planning Tools
There are planning tools throughout the site to help you make the financial decisions that are right for you in the privacy of your home. We encourage you to try all of your "what-if" scenarios as often as you like. Examples include the home loan, auto loan and mortgage payment calculators and the IRA eligibility guides.
When you use various planning tools on our website, the calculation run on your computer or our server will not include the capture of your personal information.
