Privacy Policy - MyMovingReviews
For the apps privacy policy, please click here.
Effective date: 5/29/2017
The bottom line is that MyMovingReviews, owned and operated by World Media Group LLC (collectively, "We", "Us", "Our" and "MyMovingReviews"), will NOT release your personal information without your consent when you write a moving review. We will use the information you submit in the quick moving quote form, the free moving calculator form or the cost calculator form and provide it to professional moving companies that will contact you to provide you with your moving estimate and moving cost calculation on our web site www.mymovingreviews.com.
If you have questions or concerns regarding this Statement, you should first contact us at info@mymovingreviews.com. If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider free of charge here.
Earning the trust of our users is one of MyMovingReviews’s primary goals. We take your privacy very seriously, and we want you to feel absolutely comfortable using our site. Our Privacy Policy answers the following general questions:
What information do you collect, how is it collected and how do we use it?
How is my privacy protected when I leave comments?
How will I know if you change your privacy policy?
What kind of security measures do you take?
What are the limits of your Privacy Policy?
How can I change my personal information?
What if I have more questions?
How can I be sure that you adhere to your Privacy Policy?
1. What information do you collect, how is it collected and how do you use it?
Anyone can visit our site free of charge. You are welcome to browse our ratings lists and read reviews without ever giving us your individual personal information. But we do need to gather some information about users who wish to submit ratings and reviews. We collect information in two ways: directly from you and through the use of "cookies". Third party services like Google Adsense may also collect information about you through cookies to display behavioral ads.
First, if you want to review a moving company, we will ask you to provide some personal information. If you have already registered, you know that the information we require is very basic: your e-mail address, name or/and password. One of the reasons we ask for your e-mail address is so that we can communicate with you and send you a validation email. As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. We do this to improve services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, and site functionality.
We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy. We do not sell your personal information to third parties. If you do not want us to share your personal information with these companies, contact us here.
We plan that, from time to time, we will provide certain companies (like our advertisers) with aggregated user information. We will NOT give advertisers your personal information about you without your specific authorization to do so, except when filling the quick quote form or the free moving calculator form or the cost calculator. We may also provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities such as offering customer service. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.
When the quick moving quote form or the free moving calculator form or the cost calculator is filled, the information is forwarded to partnering moving companies and moving brokers that will use the information you have submitted to provide you with commercial information. The moving reviews information and the quick quote form information are not linked and are two totally separate types of information collected and saved in separate places.

We World Media Group, LLC and our partners use technologies such as cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level.
If you are moving company and apply for a moving company account, please read the next chapter.
In certain situations, World Media Group, LLC may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities or law enforcement requirements.

2. How is my privacy protected?
One of the great features of MyMovingReviews is that we allow you, as a user, to leave comments messages and written reviews, not just ratings, so you can explain your opinions in some detail. Please remember that when you post your comments they are publicly available, so you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose anything personal about yourself. This includes your e-mail address. Many of our users like to leave their e-mail addresses with their reviews message. That way others can e-mail them if they want to discuss the moving company or the specific move. You should realize that you are not obligated to attach your email address. To request removal of your personal information from a review, contact us at info@mymovingreviews.com. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why. Alternatively, if you used a third party application to post such information, you can remove it, by either logging into the said application and removing the information or by contacting the appropriate third party application.
When you respond to a moving review (send a message to the reviewer), the information you enter is sent to the reviewer. We cannot guarantee how the reviewer will handle this information.
If you are a moving company (or you represent a moving company) and you apply for an account or update your moving company account information, the information you enter is stored behind a password and can be accessed by you and the administrators of this website. After logging into the website, you can control what information to display to the public.
California has passed legislation requiring certain specific disclosures be made available to California residents who use the Internet and provide information that may be used for marketing purposes. That legislation requires any business that discloses a customer's personal information (as defined by the act) to any third party for direct marketing purposes to provide the customer a method for obtaining the names, addresses and certain other specified details of anyone who might have received that personal information. If you are a California resident you may request this information from MyMovingReviews or any of its affiliates by sending an e-mail to info@mymovingreviews.com. MyMovingReviews.com is not obligated to respond to more than one such request from you per calendar year.
3. How will I know if you change your privacy policy?
This privacy policy may be revised over time as new features are added to the Web site. We will post those changes prominently so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose it to anyone. If we are going to use your personal information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify you via e-mail prior to the change becoming effective. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this different manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our web site notifying users prior to the change becoming effective. In some cases where we post the notice we will also e-mail users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.
4. What kind of security measures do you take?
Any information you provide, other than information you chose to provide and make publicly available in your posts or filled in the quick moving quote, is maintained and accessible only by us, and only by those of our employees with a need to have access to such information in the performance of their work. This site has instituted commercially reasonable security measures to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control or in our possession. Unfortunately, data transmission over the Internet cannot be guaranteed to be totally secure. Additionally, we also use outside companies to display ads on our site. These ads may contain cookies. While we use cookies in other parts of our Web site, cookies received with banner ads are collected by our ad company, and we do not have access to this information. Therefore, although we take measures, such as those described in this Privacy Policy, to protect your personal information, we cannot warrant the security of information that you provide. Accordingly, you agree that you are providing such information at your own risk. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact us at info@mymovingreviews.com.
5. What are the limits of your Privacy Policy?
The MyMovingReviews web site contains hyperlinks and advertisements that, if activated in the manner provided by your browser, will cause your browser to access and display the contents of other Web sites. MyMovingReviews does not control or have any knowledge concerning the provisions of the privacy policies, if any, of those sites. Accordingly, MyMovingReviews is not responsible for the privacy practices or any of the content of those web sites and MyMovingReviews’s Privacy Policy does not apply to those other sites. If you choose to activate a hyperlink to another web site and if you submit personal information to any of those sites, you do so at your own risk as your information is governed by their privacy policies and you may wish to review that site’s privacy policy.
6. How can I change or delete my personal information?
Upon request World Media Group, LLC will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information. If your personal information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, amend, delete/remove, ask to have it removed from a public forum, directory or testimonial on our site or deactivate it by making the change on our member information page, by emailing our Customer Support at info@mymovingreviews.com or by contacting us by postal mail at the contact information listed below. We will respond to your request to access within a reasonable timeframe. The information entered in the free moving quote form or the free moving calculator form or the cost calculator form cannot be modified because it is already submitted to the moving companies that prepare the moving quotes, moving estimates and the approximate moving cost calculations. The personal information entered in the free moving quote form or the free moving calculator form or the cost calculator form is used by the moving companies to contact you with the results of the moving estimate. You might be able to change or remove that information by contacting every moving company that have contacted you or by contacting us by postal mail at the contact information listed below. We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter(s), we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you.
