When ordering products and/or registering on the site, we ask that members provide certain information so we can create a member profile and customize preferences for each specific user. This also gives us as a more efficient method for contacting you about your service, should the need arise.
We receive and store information whenever you interact with the website. For example, like many websites, we use "cookies" to obtain electronic information when your Web browser accesses MyMangosteen.com or any other MyMangosteen.com site. Some companies offer utilities designed to allow you to visit websites anonymously. If you use one of these products, we will not be able to provide you with the full features of the site or a personalized experience at MyMangosteen.com.

Although most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, you can usually change your browser to prevent cookies or notify you each time you are sent a cookie. This gives you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. If you choose to not accept cookies, you could still have access to most of the features on the site. However, MyMangosteen.com uses cookies so that they can help provide visitors with a better experience.
Security of Personal Information
We work to protect the security of your information during transmission of sensitive/credit data by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. This personal data is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of employees who have special access rights to such systems.

Kids under 13 (Special Note to Parents)
Pursuant to the provisions of the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), we do not collect information from children under thirteen years of age without the consent of a parent or legal guardian. Parents, or legal guardians, may provide us with consent to collect such information by email, by facsimile or by posted mail. Parents may request to review information collected from their child, may ask to have that information deleted, and may refuse to allow further collection or use of the child's information. To request such review or to give instructions regarding the information we have collected about a child, parents or legal guardians should contact us.
We encourage parents and guardians to spend time online with their children, to participate in the interactive activities offered online, and for children to consult with their parents before submitting any information to this or any other website. Although guests under eighteen years of age may be allowed, with their parent's permission and supervision, to participate in noted contests, if such a guest wins, notification and prizes will be sent to that guest's parent or guardian. Parents should consider using parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers to help supervise their children's online activities. These tools can also prevent children from disclosing their name, address and other personal information online without parental permission. For additional information about parental control tools, please consult the "Information for Consumers" page of the Direct Marketing Association home page.
