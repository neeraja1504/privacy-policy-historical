How to Contact Us
The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for Clarke’s web properties, including our websites and mobile/tablet applications (each, a “Website”). Your continued use of a Website following the posting of changes to this privacy policy statement means you accept those changes.
The Information We Collect
At a Website, you may be able to enter contests, vote in polls or otherwise express an opinion, sign up to receive a newsletter, purchase a “classified” advertisement, browse the embedded content of our third party partners, or participate in one of our online forums or communities. In connection with such activities, we may request that you voluntarily supply us with personally identifiable information. The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected at these pages include: name, address, zip code, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, gender, birth date, and information about your interests in and use of various products, programs, and services. In addition, some Clarke websites offer the ability to integrate with third party websites, in which case you may have an opportunity to voluntarily provide additional identifiable information.
At certain parts of a Website, only persons who provide us with the requested personally identifiable information will be able to participate in programs and services or otherwise participate in the site’s activities and offerings. Our third party partners may process payment and banking information that you provide to them. Clarke has a Credit Card Security Policy that you may request for review via our feedback form.
We also may collect certain non-personally identifiable information when you visit many of our web pages such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Firefox or Google Chrome), the type of operating system you are using, (e.g., Windows or Mac OS), the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., Verizon FiOS or Comcast), and the search engine from which you were directed (e.g., Google or Bing). Each Website utilizes analytical software, including Google Analytics or other analytical software, which may collect information about users.
Each Website does not follow the Do Not Track setting of a user’s web browser.
How We Use the Information
If you provide us with your e-mail address, or have done so in the past, we may send you e-mail offers, surveys, newsletters, or other types of contacts. These are based on information you provided in your registration forms, in surveys, from information that may indicate purchasing preferences and lifestyle, as well as information available from external sources, such as census bureau data. If you have signed up to receive our e-mails and prefer not to receive marketing information from this site, follow the “unsubscribe” instructions provided on any marketing e-mail you receive from the Website.
We sometimes use this information to communicate with you, such as to notify you when you have won one of our contests, to fulfill a request by you, or to send you an online newsletter if you have signed up for a newsletter.
We also use information generally to compile statistical and user profile data and to keep in contact with users and provide them with a better interactive experience. We may use your information specifically for the following purposes: to provide a desktop version of the site for easy access with a mobile phone every time you return to the site without requiring re-entry of the desktop preference; to complete business transactions; to contact you as part of a promotion; to allow you to make a posting on the site; to administer individual classified accounts; to provide customer support; to meet legal requirements; to provide Internet security; and/or to analyze collected information.
In the event that Clarke sells a Website or business associated with a Website, all user/listener/customer information relating to a Website or Clarke business may be among the transferred assets.
We sometimes use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our site and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze site usage.
We work closely with our business partners and certain other third parties who may perform functions on our behalf, including but not limited to fulfilling orders, providing promotional materials to our users, sending e-mail, managing data, processing credit card payments, or providing customer service. They have access to your personal information to perform their functions and may not use it for any other purpose.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Privacy Policy to the contrary, to the extent you provide your information, we will not sell or rent such information to any third party unless you otherwise specifically consent.
Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.
We keep your information for no longer than necessary for the purposes for which it is processed. The length of time for which we retain information depends on the purposes for which we collected and use it and/or as required to comply with applicable laws.
Finally, we may disclose personally identifiable information in response to legal process, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose such information in response to a law enforcement agency’s request, or where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law. In addition, we may transfer information about you if we are acquired by or merged with another company.
Cookies& Web Beacons
We use and allow certain other companies to use certain tracking technologies, including cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies (collectively, “Cookies”) on a Website.

What are Cookies?
Cookies are text files that contain a certain amount of information and are downloaded to your computer or mobile device when you visit a website.

Types of Cookies We Use on Our Website
We use first party and third party Cookies for several reasons. Some Cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Site to operate, and we refer to these as “essential” or “strictly necessary” Cookies. Third parties also serve Cookies through our Website for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. The specific types of first and third party Cookies served through our Website and the functions they perform are described in more detail below.
First-party Cookies These Cookies are created by Clarke. They allow you to browse a Website and use its features.
Essential Cookies: These Cookies are necessary to allow you to move around a Website and use its features, such as accessing your posted “classified” advertisement. Without these Cookies, we cannot enable appropriate content based on the type of device you are using. Therefore, these Cookies cannot be disabled.
Embedded Scripts: An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with a Website, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your computer or other device, is active only while you are connected to a Website, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.
Analytics Cookies: We use Cookies and other identifiers (such as web beacons) to see how you use our Websites in order to enhance their performance and develop them according to the preferences of our customers and visitors. For example, Cookies and web beacons may be used to maintain a consistent look and feel across our Websites, track and provide trend analysis on how our users interact with our Websites, track errors, and measure the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns.

These types of Cookies include:

By entering, voting or otherwise participating in such contests, you are consenting to us sharing this information with such contest sponsors who may contact you directly.
