This Privacy Policy applies solely to information we collect.
Choice/Opt Out
We give our users the opportunity to “opt-out” of having their personal information used for purposes not directly related to the Site at the point where we ask for the information, including the sharing of personal information with third parties for their own marketing purposes.

If you choose to receive communications from us but later wish to discontinue receiving communications or our Services, you can opt-out by contacting us via email or mail using the contact information provided below.
Please note that opting out of receipt of promotional e-mail communications will only affect future activities or communications from us.

To opt-out of communications from our third party business partners, please contact them directly.

DomainSponsor Trademark Dispute Policy
DomainSponsor® is an automated system that dynamically generates web pages containing relevant keywords and links to advertisements that are optimized based on the behavior of internet users visiting such web pages. DomainSponsor publishers, the owners of the domain name participating in the DomainSponsor system, have the ability to choose from a number of different options to customize the keywords, taglines and “look and feel” of the web pages generated by the DomainSponsor system on behalf of DomainSponsor’s publishers.
The DomainSponsor Terms of Service prohibit its users from violating the intellectual property rights of others, and also provide that the domain name owner is solely responsible for any alleged inappropriate conduct. Accordingly, if you have a claim regarding a domain name participating in the DomainSponsor system, we strongly encourage you to contact the domain name owner directly whenever possible.
Nevertheless, while we are not in a position to arbitrate trademark disputes between domain name owners and trademark owners, we have adopted this Trademark Dispute Policy as a courtesy to assist when a dispute arises.
It is our policy to immediately review complaints of alleged trademark infringement and to perform an investigation within two (2) business days. If our investigation determines that a domain name(s) participating in the DomainSponsor system potentially violates the intellectual property rights of the complainant, we will take down the domain name from the DomainSponsor system. In appropriate circumstances and at our sole discretion, we may terminate any owners or administrators who are deemed to be repeat infringers.
If you believe that your trademark has been violated, please submit a trademark dispute notice containing the information specified below. Because our actions may necessarily affect the rights of our customers, we will not investigate complaints that do not substantially comply with this notice requirement. Please note that you may be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that an activity is infringing your trademark.
1. Your name, address, telephone number, and email address;
2. A copy of your trademark registration, or list the trademark(s) at issue, the country/countries where registered, and the registration number(s);
3. The specific domain names at issue;
4. A statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the trademark owner, its agent, or the law;
5. A statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your notice is accurate and that you are the trademark owner or authorized to act on the trademark owner's behalf;
6. Your signature
Please send your written notice of any trademark disputes to addresses specified below. While we accept communications by mail, we strongly encourage you to use electronic communications so that your communications can be properly logged and can be addressed more quickly.
