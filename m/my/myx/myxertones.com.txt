providing you with news, free newsletters, updates, targeted advertising, promotions, and special offers that give you a better understanding of how our products are used.
The information that makes up your "public profile" including the display name you choose to associate with your account, and an optional image you may have chosen to use to represent you, are public information that may be shared with others. In addition, information about what band "fanlists" you have joined, and what content you have recently contributed to or downloaded from Myxer are public by default.

HOW DO WE HANDLE CHILDREN’S PRIVACY CONCERNS?
Myxer does not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information or non-personally-identifiable information on any Myxer website from persons under 13 years of age, and no part of our websites is directed to persons under 13. If you are under 13 years of age, then please do not use or access the Myxer websites or services at any time or in any manner. If Myxer learns that personally identifiable information of persons under 13 years of age has been collected on the Myxer websites without verified parental consent, then Myxer will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.
WHEN AND HOW DO WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES?
Myxer may disclose relevant information about our customers to our contractors (e.g. a customer service contractor or a credit card clearing service) in order for them to provide specific services for Myxer, and to better serve our customers. Myxer's contractors are bound by strict contractual requirements to keep all personal information they process strictly confidential and to use such information solely on behalf of Myxer. Also, Myxer may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:
(a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Myxer;
(b) protect and defend the rights or property of Myxer and its products; or
(c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Myxer products or the public at large.
From time to time, we may share your contact information with select third parties who we think have products or services that will be of interest to you. In addition, Myxer also may use and share non-personally identifiable information, such as general demographic or location information, mobile phone make or model, wireless carrier information, content preferences and content consumption data, or information about the computer or device from which you access the Service. The use and disclosure of such anonymous information is not subject to any restrictions under this Privacy Policy. Myxer may share this information with its advertising and business partners in order to provide you with targeted advertisements and other offers which may interest you. Myxer may also enable these advertisers or business partners to ask you for personal information, with your consent, for the purpose of offering you access to their products or services. Also, in the event we sell or transfer any of the assets associated with myxer.com, this may include disclosure of your personal information to the purchasing entity.
The Myxer websites and products may contain links to other websites and products. Myxer is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites or products. Please visit the privacy policies of these sites in order to understand their privacy policies and data collection practices.
If you do not want your contact information shared with any third parties, please email support@myxer.com.
CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY
We may revise this Privacy Policy to keep it up to date with Myxer products, services and web pages and do so with some regularity. Please revisit this policy to ensure that you understand and agree with how we collect and handle your personal information.
NO ERROR FREE PERFORMANCE
We customarily release alpha and beta versions of our products, which are further refined before the release of the final version. Because these products are still in a test phase, we may not always catch an unintended privacy issue, despite our efforts to do so. As such, we welcome feedback on any privacy concerns you may have, and on how to improve our products generally, in all stages of release. Myxer does not guarantee error-free performance under this privacy policy. We will use reasonable efforts to comply with this privacy policy and will take prompt corrective action when we learn of any failure to comply with our privacy policy. Myxer shall not be liable for any incidental, consequential or punitive damages relating to this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy shall be governed by the laws of the United States.
If you have questions about the privacy aspects of our products or services or would like to make a complaint, please contact: support@myxer.com
