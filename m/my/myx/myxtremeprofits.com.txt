YOUR SECURITY
With the greatest regard for your confidentiality and privacy, all information collected through our website is treated with the utmost care. We do not share, sell, or distribute your information to anyone outside of WeNetProfits.com Administration. Personal information is never access by wenetprofits.com unless absolutely needed in our efforts to provide products or services to our subscribers.
We take precaution to protect our Subscribers and Members information. When Subscribers and Members submit sensitive information via this Web Site, their information is protected both online and off-line. When our registration/order forms ask Subscribers and Members to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number, billing information, etc.), that information is encrypted and is protected using industry standard encryption software (128 bit secure socket layers protocols).
While we use SSL encryption protocols to protect sensitive information online, we also employ security measures to protect Subscribers and Members information off-line. All of our Subscriber and Member information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. Finally, the servers that store personal information are in a secure environment.
