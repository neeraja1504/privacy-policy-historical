THE CYCLICAL MTG SPOILER MythicSpoiler is a dedicated visual spoiler, designed to let you EXPLORE, DISCOVER and EXPERIENCE new Magic the Gathering sets in a simple, sortable gallery. View the sets of mtg by color, cycle, rarity and more. Our site is organized in 5 collumns. This allows sets to be organized in a grid horizontally and vertically. Cards are split in collumns by color or faction and vertically by cycle. Each color and type will also have an individual page in which the cards from that category can be viewed. Faction affiliated sets like RAV will have an option to sort by guild while standard sets like ISD, m13, m14 will have an option to sort by card type (Instant, Sorcery, Planeswalker etc.) We are always working on expanding our card back log and improving our features.
