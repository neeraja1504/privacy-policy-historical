We gather end-users' server, IP address, computer operating system and browser-type related information as part of the general administration of the Site and in order to provide you with the Software Product ("Browser Data"). The Browser Data is collected and stored in an aggregate format, comprising the demographic, usage and/or other characteristics of Site end-users as a group without any associated end-user personally identifiable information. In order to obtain the Software Product, you must provide a unique end-user ID ("ID").
In addition, the Site tracks the number of times that you access and utilize the search functions ("Query") associated with the Software Product, and which, if any, of the links generated by the applicable query were clicked and activated by you (collectively, "Usage Data" and together with the Browser Data and ID, the "Site Data"). The Software Product, in the course of processing a given Query, sends a request to our servers. This request includes the keyword used in connection with the Query, time of day, an anonymous unique ID, Browser Data and a code which identifies the marketing or distribution source of the Software Product used by you. We use this information in order to properly process your Query. All information collected from a Query is recorded on a non-personally identifiable basis and is kept strictly anonymous. In addition, all information about Query-related activity is evaluated only on an aggregated basis except: (a) for MTWB tracking and reporting purposes; (b) in response to a customer service inquiry; or (c) in connection with a legal process.
The Software Product also sends a configuration request when you start your browser. This request is approximately 5KB in size and includes only anonymous data such as the Browser Data and the specific release date and distribution source of your Software Product. Such information is anonymous, non-personally identifiable and is used only for the purposes of delivering the Software Product-related services and content in accordance with your preferences.
When an end-user visits the Site, we send a cookie and/or gif file (collectively, "Cookie") to assign an anonymous, unique identifier to the applicable end-user's Internet browser and/or copy of the Software Product. A Cookie is a piece of data stored on your hard drive containing non-personally identifiable information about you. Cookies have many benefits to enhance your experience at the Site. For example, we use Cookies to store a code designating a marketing or distribution source for the Software Product, as well as to collect Browser Data. This information allows us to properly distinguish the Software Product for purposes of analyzing Browser Data and/or Usage Data, on an aggregated basis. We do not use Cookies to track your use of the Internet in any other way or to store any personally-identifiable information, and we do not disclose Cookie information to third parties (other than as required by legal process).
