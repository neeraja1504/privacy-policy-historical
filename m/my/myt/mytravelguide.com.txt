1. Our Collection of Your Personal Data
In order to provide you with our online travel service, we must collect personally identifiable information ("Personal Data"). This is data that you provide to us or that we obtain while you are using the site. Personal Data includes information that can identify you as a specific individual, such as your name, address, phone number, credit card number, email address, age, date of birth, gender, username and password for our site and any other information you may choose to provide either directly or through your use of social media sign-in features (such as Facebook Connect) or as may be required to fulfill the requested service.
If you purchase services for other travelers or travel companions, you must make sure that you have the right to provide their Personal Data to us and that those other travelers have accepted how Priceline uses their information as stated in this policy. Personal Data of other travelers is collected only for the purpose of providing such Personal Data to the appropriate travel supplier to fulfill the requested service, or as otherwise may be required or permitted by applicable law.
We also collect non-personally identifiable information, including your IP address, search preferences related to specific searches, location, and bids through your interactions with our site. When we link non-personally identifiable information with Personal Data, we will treat it as Personal Data under this Privacy & Cookies Policy.
2. Protecting Your Personal Data
Protecting your personal data is a top priority at Priceline. We employ technical, administrative and physical safeguards that are designed to prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and to ensure correct use of Personal Data. To provide protection for credit card transactions while in transit, Priceline currently uses Secure Socket Layer encryption.
3. Use of Your Personal Data
We use Personal Data to provide you with services, to build features that will make the services easier to use, and to contact you. This includes a faster website experience, better customer support, timely notice of new services and special offers, and more relevant content.
Our legal basis to use your data, where one is required to be provided by applicable law, is as follows:
(a) as necessary to perform a transaction;
(b) as necessary to comply with a legal obligation (such as record keeping to substantiate our compliance with law);
(c) where you have provided consent as appropriate under applicable law; and
(d) necessary for legitimate interests such as marketing that you have not previously objected to receiving.
In general, you need to provide the Personal Data in order to make a reservation and otherwise enter into a transaction with us, for us to provide you with travel reservation services, and as may be required for our compliance purposes in connection with such transactions, except in limited instances when we indicate that certain information is voluntary. Not providing Personal Data may prevent us from providing you with requested information and carrying out transactions. However, you can always exercise control over our use of Personal Data for direct marketing ( click here for details ) and you can control the use of cookies on our site (click here for details).
4. Sharing Your Personal Data
Priceline only shares your Personal Data as disclosed in this Policy or as otherwise authorized by you.
Priceline may share your Personal Data with affiliated companies and third parties as described in the categories below:
Suppliers : We may share your Personal Data with airlines, hotels, car rental agencies or other involved third-parties. Please refer to the websites of third party suppliers for their Privacy Policies.
Companies within Our Corporate Family : We may share your Personal Data with our parent company, Booking Holdings Inc., as well as our corporate affiliates, such as Booking.com BV ("Booking.com"), Agoda Company Pte. Ltd. ("Agoda"), Traveljigsaw Limited ("rentalcars.com"), KAYAK Software Corporation, and OpenTable, Inc.
Business Partners : In order to provide you with certain services, we may share your Personal Data with our business partners, or require that you transact directly with a third party business partner, such as for Priceline Cruises, which are offered through World Travel Holdings, Inc., or Group Hotels, which are offered through Lexyl Travel Technologies, Inc. When you provide Personal Data in connection with these types of services, you are providing such Personal Data to those business partners, which hold such Personal Data on our behalf. Our contracts with our business partners offering these services require them to maintain such Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy & Cookies Policy. Please refer to the websites of business partners for their Privacy Policies and other information.
Priceline's Agents and Third Party Vendors : Many of the operations we perform require us to hire other companies to help us. Examples of such operations include sending and delivering postal mail and email, analyzing data we collect, marketing our services, handling credit card transactions and providing customer service. While the companies we engage have access to Personal Data to perform their functions, they may not use it for other purposes. Priceline requires these vendors to enter into confidentiality agreements and to agree to act in a manner consistent with the relevant principles articulated in this Policy. In some instances we utilize service provider platforms to help us provide certain services, such as our career services provider. This Policy governs the collection and use of your Personal Data even though you are on a third party website. In these instances, you will always know whose Privacy & Cookies Policy governs the collection and use of your Personal Data by clicking on the Privacy & Cookies Policy link provided.
Future Business Transfers : Our business is constantly changing. As part of that process, Priceline may sell or buy other companies, and Personal Data may be transferred as part of these transactions. It is also possible that Priceline, or substantially all of its assets, may be acquired by another company, whether by merger, sale of assets or otherwise, and Personal Data may be transferred as part of such a transaction. In such cases, the acquiring company would be required to honor the privacy promises in this Privacy & Cookies Policy or obtain your consent to any material changes to how your Personal Data will be handled.
Compliance with Law and Other Disclosures : Priceline reserves the right to release Personal Data in order to comply with applicable law or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on us. We may also release Personal Data to enforce or apply Terms and Conditions applicable to the services, to protect us or others against fraudulent or inappropriate activities, or to otherwise protect the rights, property or safety of Priceline, our affiliated companies, our customers, or others.
