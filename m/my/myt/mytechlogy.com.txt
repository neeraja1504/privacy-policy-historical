Third Party Web Sites
The Website and MyTechlogy mobile app contain links to third party web sites over which we have no control. We are not and cannot be responsible for the privacy policies or practices of other web sites linked from our Website. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of those other web sites so that you can understand how they collect, use and share your information.
