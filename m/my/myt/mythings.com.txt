Privacy Policy - myThings
myThings takes privacy very seriously
The following describes the overall company Privacy Policy of myThings (referred to as “myThings“, “we”, “us” and “our”). We understand how important it is to keep your personal information confidential, especially online. Our commitment to protecting your privacy is outlined in the policies below.
This Privacy Policy was created to inform you what information we collect when you visit www.mythings.com as well as our customer’s (referred to as “Advertisers”) websites; and then how that information is collected and used by companies that display advertisements(referred to as “Partners”). Those who visit our Advertisers’ websites are referred to as “Prospects” throughout this policy. Because our Privacy Policy may be updated periodically, we encourage you to review these pages on a regular basis.
Personal and non-personal information
Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) is data about you that is personally identifiable; like your name, email address, credit card number or any other information that is not otherwise publicly available. The PII that myThings collects from you is information you supply to us; such as your name and email address. We use this information for the sole purpose of responding to your inquiry once you have submitted an email to us via our contact us form.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information (”NPII”) data is collected by myThings and myThings’s Partners, and is used by myThings for the purpose of online Retargeting. NPII data collected by myThings for advertising purposes is completely anonymous, and only includes information such as the Prospect’s IP address, date and time of visit, domain type, and their activity on our Advertiser’s and Partner’s websites. None of this information, individually or grouped together, can be traced back to a specific individual.
Cookies
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. myThings uses its cookies to provide a service known as Retargeting (details explaining Retargeting found below.) A Prospect receives a cookie from myThings and myThings’s Partners when they visit myThings.com, and / or when they visit one of myThings’s Advertiser’s websites. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.
The use of cookies by our partners is not covered by our privacy policy. myThings has no access to or control over partner cookies but requires that each partner only collect NPII information for the use of serving retargeted ads. Any Partner found in violation of this policy will immediately be removed.
Flash LSOs
We use local shared objects, also known as Flash cookies, to store your preferences such as volume control or high game score, or display content based upon what you view on our site to personalize your visit.
Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies click here:

Retargeting and myThings’ use of cookies / NPII
myThings’s technology utilizes cookies and Flash LSOs in the delivery of advertisements to our Advertiser’s Prospects on our Partner’s websites across the internet. This form of marketing is called Retargeting; and it enhances the web surfing experience by showing advertisements to the Prospect that are of interest to them. When a Prospect visits one of myThings’s Advertiser’s websites, a myThings pixel on that site sets a myThings cookie on the browser of the Prospect, and a Flash LSO on his computer. When that Prospect visits one of myThings’s Partners’ websites; our Partner’s website will identify the cookie on browser of the Prospect and recognize that they previously visited our Advertiser’s website. The Prospect will then be shown an advertisement from that Advertiser. In this instance, myThings will know that the Prospect first visited our Advertiser’s website, and then our Partner’s website. We will know the Prospect viewed the Ad on our Partner’s website, and whether or not the Prospect clicked on that Ad. This type information is what myThings uses in reporting; and in no way can be used to identify who that Prospect is, or any other online activities of the Prospect outside of myThings’s Advertisers and Partner’s websites.
The NPII data collected by myThings in the above outlined process of Retargeting will be kept by myThings for the period of one year. After one year, all cookie data and IP addresses is purged. This information is used strictly for reporting purposes and is not tied to personal information. You are able to Opt Out of myThings’s services if you do not want to be a part of future reporting or take part in Retargeting services from myThings – please see below for instructions on how to Opt Out.
