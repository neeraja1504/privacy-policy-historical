What we do
How does Trustmark protect my personal information?
|
To protect your personal information from unauthorized access and use, we use security measures that comply with federal law. These measures include computer safeguards and secured files and buildings.
We restrict access to your personal and account information to those associates with proper authorization to access such information.
How does Trustmark collect my personal information?
|
We collect your personal information, for example, when you
open an account or apply for a loan
make deposits or withdrawals from your account
use your credit or debit card
apply for insurance
We also collect your personal information from others, such as credit bureaus.
Why can’t I limit all sharing?
|
Federal law gives you the right to limit only
sharing for affiliates’ everyday business purposes—information about your creditworthiness
affiliates from using your information to market to you
sharing for nonaffiliates to market to you
State laws and individual companies may give you additional rights to limit sharing.
What happens when I limit sharing for an account I hold jointly with someone else?

Your choice will apply to everyone on your account.
