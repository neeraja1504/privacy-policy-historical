1 Basic Information on Data Handling
1.1 Extent of the personal data processing
We fundamentally collect and use the personal data of our users only insofar as this is required for the provision of a functional website and of our contents and services as well as for the implementation of our business purpose. As a rule we collect and use the personal data of our users only after the user has given his/her consent. Exceptions apply in such cases where it was not possible to obtain prior consent for factual reasons and where the processing of the data is permitted because of statutory requirements.
1.2 Purposes and legal basis for the processing of personal data
We process personal data only to fulfil our contractual obligations or to preserve our overriding legitimate interests. Our legitimate interests are the implementation of our business purpose.
Insofar as we obtain consent from the data subject for processing operations of personal data, Article 6, paragraph 1, sentence 1 lit. a EU General Data Protection Regulation (EU-GDPR) serves as the legal basis for the processing of personal data.
In the processing of personal data required to perform a contract of which the contractual party is the data subject, Art. 6 paragraph 1 sentence 1 lit. b GDPR serves as the legal basis. This also applies to processing operations that are necessary to carry out pre-contractual measures.
Insofar as processing of personal data is required to fulfil a legal requirement that our company is subject to, Art. 6 paragraph 1 sentence 1 lit. c GDPR serves as the legal basis.
In the case that vital interests of the data subject or another natural person make the processing of personal data necessary, Art. 6 paragraph 1 sentence 1 lit. d GDPR serves as the legal basis.
If processing is required to protect a legitimate interest of our company or of a third party and the interests do not override the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject of the first-named interest, Art. 6 paragraph 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR serves as the legal basis for the processing.
1.3 Categories of recipients and personal data, origin of the same; data transmission
We forward personal data to our business partners and service providers for the implementation of the business purpose. To implement our business purpose we use typical contact and address data of our customer and business partners. We typically receive the personal data direct from the data subject or with the consent of the data subject and also in exceptional cases from third parties.
Insofar as nothing to the contrary is stated in the following sections, no forwarding of your data to third parties takes place, unless we are legally obliged to do so, or the data transmission is required to perform the contractual relationship or you have previously given your explicit consent to the forwarding of your data. External service providers and partner companies, such as, for example, online payment providers or the shipping company tasked with the delivery, only receive your data insofar as it is necessary for the execution of your order. However, in these cases the extent of the transmitted data is restricted to the minimum required. Insofar as our service providers come into contact with your personal data, we assure that the regulations of the data protection laws are observed in the same manner. Please also observe the data protection notices of the individual providers. The individual service provider is responsible for the contents of third party services, whereby we verify as far as can be reasonably expected that the services observe statutory requirements.
1.4 Transmission to third countries
Essentially we do not forward personal data to recipients in third countries (i.e. countries outside of the EU). Should data be forwarded to recipients in third countries, we assure not only that we will obtain the permission required for the forwarding, but that the third country recipient also assures an adequate level of data protection (or derogations for specific situations pursuant to Art 49 paragraph  1 GDPR applies).
In specific case we forward personal data to recipients in third countries (i.e. countries outside of the EU).
United States of America
In these specific cases we give the following guarantees as described in Art. 44 GDPR:
EU standard contractual clauses
Privacy shield
1.5 Data security
We have taken extensive technical and organisational precautions to protect your data from accidental or intentional manipulation, loss, destruction or access by unauthorised persons. Our security procedures are regularly checked and revised to take into account technological progress.
1.6 Data deletion and storage periods
The personal data of the data subject is deleted or blocked, as soon as the purpose for which it was stored no longer applies. Storage can also be effected if this was required by the European or national legislators in European Union regulations, laws or other stipulations that the person responsible is subject to. The data is also blocked or deleted if a statutory storage period prescribed by the cited standards expires, unless there is a need for continued data storage for the purposes of a conclusion or performance of a contract.
2 General Data Collection when visiting our Website
When visiting the website for purely informational purposes, i.e. when you do not register or transfer other information to us, we collect only the personal data that your browser transmits to our server.
Within the framework of the balancing of interests pursuant to Art. 6 paragraph  1 senteince1 lit. f GDPR we have taken into account and weighed up our interest in provision and your interest in the processing of your personal data in compliance with data protection requirements. As the data below is necessary for the technical provision of our service in order to be able to offer you access to our website and also to ensure stability and security, in particular to offer protection against misuse, we have come to the conclusion that this data - in conjunction with an assurance of data security based on the state of technology - can be processed, whereby your interest in processing in compliance with data protection requirements is adequately taken into account.
**Description and extent of data collection   **
Whenever our internet site is visited, our system automatically records data and information from the computer system of the visiting computer.
The following data is collected:
Information about the browser type and version used
The operating system and the interface of the user
The internet server provider of the user
The IP address of the user
Access status/http status code
Date and time of the visit
Time zone difference to Greenwich Mean Time
Content of the request (concrete internet page)
The quantity of data transmitted
Websites, from which the system of the user accessed our internet site
Websites that are visited by the system of the user via our website
Regarding mobile end devices: Manufacturer and type designation of the Smartphone, tablet or other mobile end devices
Low-level tracer
The data is likewise stored in the logfiles of our system. Storage of this data together with other personal data of the user does not take place.
**Legal basis for data processing  **
The legal basis for the temporary storage of the data and the logfiles is Art. 6, paragraph 1, sentence1 lit. f GDPR.
Purpose of data processing
The temporary storage of the IP address by the system is necessary so as to enable delivery of the website to the computer of the user. To do this the IP address of the user remains stored for the duration of the session.
Storage in logfiles is required in order to assure the functionality of the website. In addition, the data serves to optimise the website and to assure the security of our IT systems. In particular our website and our other IT system help us to adapt to the browser, operating system and end devices used.
An evaluation of the data for marketing purposes does not take place in this connection.
These purposes are also our legitimate interest in data processing pursuant to Art. 6 paragraph 1 sentence1 lit. f GDPR.
Duration of the storage
The data is deleted as soon as it is no longer required to achieve the purpose for which it was collected. If the data is recorded in order to provide the website, this is the case when the session in question has ended.
In the case of storage of data in logfiles, this is the case after seven days at the latest. Storage above and beyond this period is possible. In this case the IP addresses of the user are deleted or distorted so that it is no longer possible to recognise the calling client.
**Right to object and removal  **
The recording of data for the provision of the website and the storage of the data in logfiles is absolutely essential for the operation of the internet site. As a consequence the user has no possibility to object to this.

This is the case for the data collected during the registration process if the registration on our internet site is cancelled or modified.
Insofar as the data collected during the registration process is required to perform a contract or to take steps prior to entering into a contract, this is only the case when the data is no longer required to perform the contract. Even after conclusion of the contract it may still be necessary to store personal data in order to fulfil contractual or statutory obligations.
Personal data is stored as a measure to prevent fraud.
The deletion deadline for the purposes of fraud prevention is 6 months, for actual attempts of fraud 6 months.
Right to object and removal
As a user you can cancel your registration at any time. You can have the data stored about you altered at any time.

5 Newsletter
We use the so-called double opt-in procedure and the confirmed opt-in procedure for registration to our newsletter. The double opt-in procedure means that we send you a confirmation email to the email address you provide, in which we ask you to confirm that you wish to receive the newsletter. If you do not confirm within a period of 72 hours, the data will be deleted automatically. If you confirm your wish to receive the newsletter, we will store your email address until you unsubscribe from the newsletter. The storage serves the sole purpose of being able to send you the newsletter. In addition, we also store your IP addresses when you register and confirm as well as the times, in order to prevent misuse of your personal information.
Email Service Provider: The newsletter will be sent by Emarsys interactive services GmbH, Stralauer Allee 6, 10245 Berlin, Germany, hereinafter referred to as the "Email Service Provider". You can view the privacy policy of the email service provider here: https://www.emarsys.com/en/privacy-policy/

The provision of additional, specially marked information is voluntary, and it will be used solely for the purpose of personalising the newsletter. This data will also be completely deleted if you revoke consent. In addition, we store the IP addresses you use for registration and confirmation, as well as the times these events take place. The purpose of this procedure is to have evidence of your registration and, if necessary, to clarify any possible misuse of your personal data. After your confirmation, we save your registration data for the purpose of sending you the newsletter. The legal basis for this is Art. 6(1)(1)(a) GDPR.
If we have received your email address in connection with your order and you have not objected to this, we reserve the right to send you regular offers by email for products similar to those you have already purchased from our product range.
You can object to the use of your email address and the processing and use of data to create user profiles at any time without giving reasons, simply by sending a message to privacy@mytheresa.com or via the unsubscribe link in the email newsletter, without incurring any costs other than the transmission costs according to the basic tariffs defined in, for example, your existing Internet service contract.
We would like to point out that we evaluate your user behaviour when sending the newsletter. For this evaluation, the emails we send contain so-called web beacons, also known as tracking pixels. These are one-pixel image files that link to our website, enabling us to evaluate your user behaviour. This is done by collecting web beacons, which are assigned to your email address and linked to your own ID. Links contained in the newsletter also contain these beacons.
The email service provider also stores cookies on your computer through your web browser. The cookies and the identification numbers stored in them will not be associated with your name, address, email address or other personally identifiable information unless you have expressly permitted us to send you information specifically tailored to your interests. The email service provider uses these cookies to recognize your browser, so that we can track your movements on our website as well as recording and measuring the success of certain marketing actions. We use this information to improve our website and email newsletters, in particular by adapting our information and offers to the individual interests and needs of users.
The storage of cookies by the email service provider is carried out on the basis of Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. The website operator has a justified interest in the anonymous analysis of user behaviour in order to optimise both their website and their advertising.
With the data obtained in this way, we create a pseudonymous user profile in order to be able to provide you with a newsletter tailored to your interests. The following data will be collected:
Have you opened the newsletter? And what did you click on in it?
When and how long did you visit our website? What products and categories did you look at?
When and what did you purchase? What category, and in what amount? And: Did you cancel the order?
We associate this data with your user account, if you have logged in.
The information we collect is stored on a server located within the European Union.
You can opt out of the cookie-based collection and analysis of online data described above by clicking the opt-out button below. If you exercise this option, an anonymous "opt-out" cookie will be stored in your web browser, informing the Emarsys web servers of your opting out and preventing the collection of data. The opt-out cookie will remain in effect in the browser you are using until you delete it using that browser. However, if you delete the cookie or use a different browser or computer, the email service provider will no longer be able to recognise that you have declared your objection. Alternatively, you can configure your browser so that it does not accept cookies.
If you have registered in our webshop and placed products on your wish list, you will receive emails informing you about discounts, availability and the last available unit of the products on the wish list. You can unsubscribe from these notifications by unchecking the box at the end of the wish list.
6 Your Order in our Online shop
If you would like to place an order in our web shop it is necessary for the purposes of concluding the contract that you provide personal data which we require to process the order. Mandatory details required for the processing of contracts are specifically marked as such, other details are voluntary. We use the data given by you to process you order. In addition, we can forward your payment details to the payment service provider selected by you. Additionally, we forward your address details to the shipping logistics service provider selected to carry out shipping.
The legal basis for this is Art. 6 paragraph 1 sentence1 lit b. GDPR.
You can also create a user account on a voluntary basis, which we can then use to store your data for additional purchases at a later date. This registration is based on Point 3 of this declaration.
We can also process the data given by you in order to notify you about additional products in our range that you may find of interest or have emails about technical information sent to you.
Commercial and fiscal stipulations require us to store your address, payment and order details for the period of ten years. Nevertheless, we restrict processing after two years; this means your data is only used to observe the statutory requirement.
You can object to the use of your data for advertising and data analysis purposes at any time. Please send your objection to privacy@mytheresa.com.
To prevent unauthorised access to your personal data, in particular financial data, the order process is encrypted by hybrid encryption protocol for the secure data transmission "Secure Socket Layer" (SSL).

Afterwards both the recommender and the recommended friend receive a reward for the recommendation, as long as the recommended friend clicks the sent link and becomes a customer of Mytheresa. The recommendation will be transmitted by Mention Me on behalf of Mytheresa.
We will share selected information from you (email address, name and order details) with Mention Me in encrypted, pseudonymised form so that you can participate in our "Customer Referral Program". This can later be used to determine how many and which existing customers a new customer was recruited through and who receives a reward for their recommendation.
The email address, the name and the IP address of the referrer are processed for this purpose. The email address and IP address of the recommended friend are also processed, both exclusively in pseudonymised form.
The processing of the data takes place voluntarily and with the consent of the recommender or recommended friend. The data will not be used for any other purpose and will not be passed on to third parties without authorisation.
The consent can be revoked at any time with effect for the future. Beyond this, no data is collected or processed via the platform. For more details on Mention Me's data protection processes, please refer to Mention Me's Privacy Policy, which can be found here: https://mention-me.com/help/privacy_policy_s#referrers .

14 AFFILIATE NETWORKS
In addition, we collaborate with affiliate networks, such as Commission Junction/Zanox/etc.
An affiliate network is a service provider from the online advertising sector and an agent between advertisers (mytheresa.com) and publishers (website operators). Publishers can enter into a partnership via the affiliate network with mytheresa.com and thus take part in special promotions. Therefore, the publisher integrates a mytheresa advertisement/promotion code/hyperlink in the content on its website and thus leads the customer to our online shop through, for example, an editorial text.
As soon as the user buys on mytheresa.com, the publisher receives an appropriate commission. Only the information on the sale, such as order ID, product ID and the prices of the products sold, is transferred to the network. No personal data are collected or transferred.

20 DISCLOSING DATA
There will be no transfer of your personal data to a third party apart from for the specified purposes.
We disclose your personal data to a third party only if:
you have given your explicit consent to do so,
the disclosure is required for asserting, exercising or defending legal rights and there are no grounds for assuming that you have an overriding legitimate interest in the non-disclosure of your data,
that there is a statutory obligation for the disclosure, and
this is legally permissible and required for implementing the contractual relationships with you.
Fundamentally, the high European level of data protection does not apply to data transfer outside the European Union. For a transfer, it can be that there is currently no adequacy decision by the EU Commission in the sense of Art. 45, Para. 1, 3 GDPR. This means that the EU Commission has not yet positively determined that the country-specific level of data protection corresponds to the level of data protection of the European Union based on GDPR, which is why we have created the abovementioned suitable guarantees.
Possible risks, which cannot be completely excluded in connection with the data transfer are in particular:
your personal data could possibly be dealt with beyond the actual purpose.
Moreover, there is a possibility that you cannot sustainably assert and implement any of your legal data protection rights, such as, for example, your right to information, correction, deletion or data portability.
There may also be a higher probability that there could be incorrect data processing and the personal data do not quantitively and qualitatively meet or not fully meet the requirements of GDPR.
