There are a number of ways that you could fall victim to this crime, including "phishing" (seemingly genuine but forged e-mails from a seemingly reputable company that ask you to provide them with personal information in a linked website) and "garbage sifters" (individuals who sort through your rubbish looking for bank statements, invoices, etc. that reveal your personal information. The best way to avoid becoming a victim is to be alert and aware of suspicious activities and modus operandi used by potential fraudsters.
