Security
TimeStation strives to protect your personal information.

The encryption process protects your information, by scrambling it before it is sent to us from your computer. Once TimeStation receives your transmission, we make commercially reasonable efforts to ensure its security on our system. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

Those countries may have data protection rules that are different from those of your country. However, we will take measures to ensure that any such transfers comply with applicable data protection laws and that your Personal Data remains protected to the standards described in this Privacy Policy. In certain circumstances, courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security authorities in those other countries may be entitled to access your Personal Data.

Additional Policy Information
Invitations: You have the opportunity to invite others to work with you through your TimeStation account. To do that, TimeStation asks you to import or to manually enter your contacts’ email addresses. As you direct, we then send them an invitation on your behalf or other notices reflecting changes you make to their status in your account.
If you click on a link to a third-party site, you will leave the TimeStation site and go to the site you selected. If you elect to use a third-party product or service in conjunction with TimeStation, you yourself enter into a license agreement with the third party for use of their product or service and their use of your data. Because we cannot control the activities of third parties, we cannot accept responsibility for any use of your personally identifiable information by such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy practices as TimeStation. We encourage you to review the privacy statements of any other service provider from whom you request services. If you visit a third party website that is linked to a TimeStation site, you should read that site’s privacy statement before providing any personally identifiable information.
We may post your testimonial or review along with your name. If you want your testimonial removed please contact us at support@MyTimeStation.com.
Account Deletion
TimeStation is a complex business network that connects millions of users. TimeStation  manages a business eco system that brings together employees, companies and customers. This network relies on the exchange and sharing of information that is important to others in your network. Tracked hours, attendance status, employees, departments are all vital to other people that work with you. These are the official history of work done and moneys paid.
The complexity and connected nature of the system requires that this history exists in perpetuity to accommodate proper function and accounting for the other systems that you have connected to like payroll and accounting systems. TimeStation cannot guarantee the deletion of all your information.
When a customer chooses to close an account we will remove your information from our marketing and billing systems. This will ensure that there are not further mailings or billings directed towards the canceled user.
As we continue to refine TimeStation we will establish a method for the complete removal of all user information from the system without breaking accepted accounting principles for other connected TimeStation accounts. This document will evolve as these new methods are defined and tested for permanent account deletion. Users wishing to be notified when this development is complete can indicate their wishes via support@MyTimeStation.com.

If you are a EU resident, and are an employee/member of an organization that uses TimeStation, under the GDPR (the new General Data Protection Regulation standardising EU data privacy and protection laws that comes into effect on May 25th, 2018), you are entitled to make a data request from that organization.
Organizations that use TimeStation are classified as “data controllers” of their members’ data under the GDPR. If you have questions about the personal data that a TimeStation organization holds about you, ask that TimeStation organization to supply you with the information you need by visiting the organizations’s website or office, or calling the organization at their listed phone number.

Information about the data being held;
To have any inaccuracies in the data corrected;
To have information erased;
To object to direct marketing;
To restrict the processing of their information, including automated decision-making (i.e., a decision made solely by automated means without any human intervention) or profiling (i.e., automated processing of personal data to evaluate certain things about an individual); and
Data portability (to have data provided in a portable form to the individual requesting it or to have data sent to a third party at an individual’s request).
While TimeStation is a data-processor for members of organizations that use TimeStation, TimeStation is a data controller of all its organizations’ personal data. TimeStation sets out what organizations data it holds, how it protects organizations data, why it holds organization data and what it does with organization data in this privacy policy.
