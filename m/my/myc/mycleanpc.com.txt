1. Information Collection
We collect personally identifiable information about you via our Website when you provide it through various forms and places on the Website, such as when you provide it in order to open an account with us or purchase software licenses and technical support services from us. You may browse our Website without providing any personal information; however if, for example, you decide to purchase technical support, we will ask you for your name, age, the password to your computer in the event you purchase certain technical support services, billing address, phone number(s), email address, and payment information such as credit/debit card number, expiration dates, PayPal or third party payment information. Also, to the extent we offer identity protection services (if ever) and you purchase them, USTechSupport may need to collect your social security number. If you choose to complete a user registration form, survey, we may ask you for personal information, such as your contact information ( e.g. , name, e-mail address and mailing address). Occasionally, we may also ask you for other demographic information, such as gender, income level, and information about your prior experiences with the USTechSupport's products. If we combine demographic information with the personal information we collect directly from you on our Website, we will treat the combined data as personal information under this Privacy Policy. When you submit your personally identifiable or demographic information on one of the Website, you are giving your consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
We may receive information about you from your friends and others that use the Website, such as when they submit your information to us about you. Additionally, we may, from time to time, supplement the information we collect directly from you on our Website with outside records from third parties for various purposes, including to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities that may be of interest to you. You may delete the other person's information from your account or the other person may contact us at support2@ustechsupport.com to request that we remove their information from our database. Note: Although you can remove the information from your account for future orders, the other person's information may be retained with the original transaction for auditing and legal purposes. In no other circumstances do our statements under this Privacy Policy apply to information we receive about you from third parties.
We also use the tracking technologies described in Section 5 below in order to automatically (or passively) collect, store or accumulate certain non-personally identifiable information concerning your use of this Website, such as information regarding which of our pages are most popular and remembering you and your preferences, your IP address, UDID or other unique identifier, device functionality (including browser, operator system, hardware, mobile network information), device location, device characteristics, city, time zone, MAC address, referring and exit URL and similar information. Information gathered may be used in aggregate form for internal and other business purposes, such as generating statistics, developing marketing plans, customizing content, tailoring our products, services and advertising to suit the personal interests of you and others and improving the Website. This usage information may be stored or accessed using a variety of technologies that may be downloaded to your personal computer, browser, laptop, tablet, mobile phone or other device whenever you visit or interact with our Website. We may share or transfer such aggregate, non-personally identifiable information with or to our affiliates, licensees, partners and other third parties. We may combine automatically collected Website usage information with your personal information. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to the combined information.
When we provide technical support services to you, we also may collect (in some instances with your authorization first), the following information about your computer or other device:
Technical information about the basic configuration and operation of your computer, including operating system version, processor type, disk space, memory space, and number of drivers;
Information about USTechSupport software on your computer, including the version and when it was installed and upgraded; and
Certain events that occur on your computer, including when USTechSupport software is installed, when USTechSupport software receives threat updates, and when errors occur in USTechSupport software.
This information collected as part of our provision of technical support services to you is sent only to USTechSupport when you reach out to us for assistance, and it is stored in an anonymous form that cannot be used to identify you. By way of explanation, although USTechSupport knows, based on the information, that there is a customer with a certain kind of computer that is performing certain functions, USTechSupport, does not know the customer's identity unless you tell it to us. In the event that it is necessary for USTechSupport to learn your identity in order to diagnose certain kinds of problems or to monitor your computer for certain events, you will be asked to authorize USTechSupport to collect the additional information. You can make your selection as to whether USTechSupport may collect this additional information before the software is installed or buy using a control panel included in the software. You can change your selection concerning this feature by using the control panel.

Please allow up to ten (10) days for us to process your request. This will not affect subsequent subscriptions and if your opt-out is limited to certain types or categories of emails the opt-out will be so limited.

If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, please contact Customer Service.
The USTechSupport may share non-personal information, such as aggregated user statistics, with third parties. The USTechSupport may also share and sell your information, such as your name, email address, mailing address and/or telephone number to business partners, vendors and other third party organizations to provide you with information about products, services and special offers we think may interest you or to improve our products, services and advertising.

In addition, we may share the information we have collected about you, including personal information, as disclosed at the time you provide your information and as described below or otherwise in this Privacy Policy.
We may contract with companies or individuals to provide certain services including email and hosting services, credit card processing, shipping, data management, surveys and marketing, promotional services, to assist in preventing or deterring fraud, etc. We call them our "Service Providers". We may share personally identifiable information with Service Providers solely as appropriate for them to perform their functions, but they may not use such information for any other purpose.
We do not share your credit card information with unaffiliated third parties unless you authorize us to do so, or if it is necessary to fulfill our responsibilities, including, but not limited to, delivering a product or service that you order.
Some of our pages utilize framing techniques to serve content to/from our partners while preserving the look and feel of our Website. Please be aware that you are providing your personal information to these third parties and not to USTechSupport.
The USTechSupport may, in its sole discretion, disclose personal information in special cases: (1) when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) the rights of the USTechSupport or to anyone that could be harmed by such activities; (2) when we believe in good faith that the law requires it; (3) to a subsequent owner, co-owner or operator of a Website or applicable database or in connection with a merger, consolidation, restructuring, the sale of substantially all of our interests and/or assets or other corporate change, including, during the course of any due diligence process; and (4) in situations involving threats to the physical safety of any person.
3. Information Security
We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), an advanced security protocol that protects your credit card information and ensures secure online ordering. SSL Internet connections are encrypted, and thus protect all credit card ordering information, including your name, address and credit card number, so it cannot be read in transit. We use secure technology, privacy protection controls, and restrictions on employee access, to safeguard your personal information. Please note, however, that although we employ industry-standard security measures to safeguard the security of your personal information, no transmissions made on or through the Internet are guaranteed to be secure. Please note that we cannot ensure the security of any information you transmit to us, and you use our Website and provide us with your information at your own risk.
4. Access and Choice

We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe.

We and our marketing partners, affiliates, or analytics or service providers, use technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags, browser and device fingerprinting, network traffic monitoring, active scripting, recognition technologies and scripts, to analyze trends, administer the Website, tracking users' movements around the Website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis.
There may be other tracking technologies now and later devised and used by us in connection with the Website. Further, third parties may use tracking technologies in connection with our Website, which may include the collection and storing of information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services.
We and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as a DoubleClick cookie) together to report how your ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to our Website. Google's use of the DoubleClick cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads based on your visit to our Website and/or other sites and online services. To learn more about how to opt out of Google's use of first-party cookies, click here. To learn more about how to opt out of DoubleClick's use of cookies, visit the DoubleClick opt-out page, here.
Additionally, the Website may use Adobe's analytics and on-site personalization services. See http://www.adobe.com/privacy/analytics.html for more information. To learn about opting out of the use of Adobe cookies for analytics and on-site personalization, visit http://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html#4. After you opt out of the use of Adobe cookies for analytics and on-site personalization, Adobe will no longer collect and analyze information via cookies associated with your browser for these services. When you opt out, Adobe will place opt-out cookies on your browser. If you delete your cookies, change browsers, or change devices, you will need to repeat this opt-out process. Also, please note that this opt-out process will work only if your browser is set to accept all cookies. We may not control those tracking technologies and we are not responsible for them. However, you consent to potentially encountering third-party tracking technologies in connection with use of our Website and accept that our statements under this Privacy Policy do not apply to the Tracking Technologies or practices of such third parties.

We use Local Storage, such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences.

Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.

6. Do Not Track Signals
Some web browsers are developing or offering signals or other mechanisms for the expression of consumer choice regarding the collection of information about an individual consumer's online activities over time and across third-party web sites or online services ( e.g. , a "Do Not Track" ("DNT") signal). A DNT signal is a HTTP header field indicating your preference regarding tracking or cross-site user tracking. We do not monitor or take any action with respect to DNT signals.
7. Ads and Information About You
We may work with third parties, such as network advertisers and ad exchanges that use tracking technologies on our Website in order to provide tailored advertisements on our behalf and/or on behalf of other advertisers across the Internet and we may use third party analytics service providers to evaluate and provide us and/or third parties with information about the use of these ads on third party sites and viewing of ads and of our content. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements, which may be based on your activities (including past visits to our Website) across the Internet and mobile media ("Behavioral Ads"). Behavioral Ads enable us to target advertisements to you for products and services in which we believe you might be interested. If you object to receiving Behavioral Ads from us on third party sites, you can learn more about your ability to limit Behavioral Ads below. Our third party ad network and exchange providers, the advertisers and/or traffic measurement services may themselves set and access their own technologies on your device and track certain behavioral usage information via a device identifier. These third party technologies may be set to, among other things: (a) help deliver advertisements to you that you might be interested in; (b) prevent you from seeing the same advertisements; and (c) understand the usefulness of the advertisements that have been delivered to you.
Statements regarding our practices do not apply to the methods for collecting information used by these third parties or the use of the information that such third parties collect. We do however work with third parties to make efforts to have you provided with information on their practices and any available opportunity to exercise choice. We make no representations regarding the policies or practices of third party advertisers or advertising networks or exchanges or related third parties.
Further, while sites use a variety of companies to serve advertisements, you may wish to visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp, which provides information regarding this practice by Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including the "opt-out" procedures of NAI members. Opting out of one or more NAI members only means that those NAI members no longer will be allowed under their own rules to deliver Behavioral Ads to you, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads. Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different device or change web browsers, your NAI opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective. You may also opt-out of receiving Behavioral Ads on participating sites and services by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA") website at http://www.aboutads.info/choices (or if located in the European Union click here). Similar limitations may apply to the DAA opt-out. We are not responsible for effectiveness of or compliance with any third parties' opt-out options or programs.
8. External Links
Our Website may offer links to and from other third party sites. Other sites have their own policies regarding privacy. If you visit one of these sites, you may want to review the privacy policy on that site. For example, you may have linked to the USTechSupport's site through a banner advertisement on another site. In such cases the site you have linked from may collect information from people who click on the banner or link.

9. Social Media Widgets
Our Website may include social media features ("Features"), such as the Facebook Like button, and widgets, such as the Share This button or interactive applications or mini-programs that run on our Website. These Features may collect your Internet protocol address, which page you are visiting on our Website, and may set a cookie to enable the Features to function properly. The use of this functionality may involve the third-party operator providing certain information, including Personal Information, to us. If you click on social media icons on the Website (such as for Facebook, Twitter or Instagram), those actions may be associated with, and we may have access to, your Personal Information you provided on those third-party sites or applications. If so, we will then treat it as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy, since we are collecting it as a result of your accessing of and interaction on our Website. Features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Website. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy statement of the USTechSupport providing it. You should review the applicable third-party privacy policies before using such third-party tools on our Website.
10. Blogs/Forums
Our Website may, from time to time, offer publicly accessible blogs or community forums where you can submit ideas, photographs, writings, music, video, audio recordings, computer graphics, pictures, data, information about your location, questions, comments, suggestions or other content, including personal information. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. Please note that USTechSupport does not control who will have access to the information that you choose to make public, and cannot ensure that parties who have access to such publicly available information will respect your privacy or keep it secure.
