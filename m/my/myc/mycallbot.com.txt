Privacy Policy - MyCallBot
Information Collection and Use
We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. MyCallBot and its authorized agents automatically receive and record "traffic data" on their server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information, and the page you requested.
Communications from the Site
Generally, MyCallBot does not initiate communication with users. Service related announcements will be made through the site itself on its homepage or similarly recognizable location.
Information Sharing and Disclosure
We may release personal information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with a law; to enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other policies; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of the Company, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud and risk protection.
Cookies
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.
We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file.
Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.
If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site will be limited.
Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies.
This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by MyCallBot only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
