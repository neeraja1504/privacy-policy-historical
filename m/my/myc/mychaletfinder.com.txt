When logging on to our website, we collect, process and use the IP address of your terminal as well as other information such as date, time, the called-up page and store this information. This data is not utilised except anonymously for statistical purposes. We only store your personal data like name, physical and postal addresses, telephone number, fax number, eMail address etc. when you give them to us during a booking procedure or if you are advertising a service on the website through, for example, banner adverts or other promoted services such as airport transfers or ski schools.
Personal information collected
When you visit, register or use the services on this website, you may be asked to provide certain information about yourself, including your name and your contact details. We may also collect information about how you use this website including your searches, the properties and pages you look at, the advertisers or partners you contact and the contents of the emails you send to them. Finally, we may also collect information from any correspondence that you have with us. Collectively, we refer to this as "Your Information".
All of the forms where you might enter personal information on our website have tick box options to enable you to specify your consent (or otherwise) to our use of Your Information. We always use the the most recently submitted form to be your current consent status. If you are a registered user, but not signed in when you submit a form, we won't be able to use your saved settings so will deem your consent choice to be as per the form you submit at the time.
What happens if you choose not to give us your personal data?
We may need to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you.
If you choose not to give us this personal data, it may delay or prevent us providing our products or services to you. For example, not providing an email address would prevent us activating your advertising account.
Sometimes we might ask for information that is useful for us to know but is not required by law or a contract. When this is the case, we will make this clear by marking it as optional. You do not have to provide these extra bits of information, and your choice will not prevent us providing you with our products or services.
How do we use your data for marketing?
We may use your personal data to tell you about our relevant products, competitions and offers. This is what we mean when we talk about ‘marketing’.
We will send you marketing based on what you tell us about yourself, data we collect when you use our services, and using information from third parties we work with. We use this information to get a view on what we think would interest you the most.
We will only send you marketing messages if we have either your consent or a legitimate interest. This is when we have a legitimate business or commercial reason to use your information that does not unfairly go against what is right and best for you.
You can ask us to stop sending you marketing messages by contacting us at any time by clicking unsubscribe at the bottom of any marketing email or updating your preferences in your online account.
Whatever you choose for marketing, you'll still receive service messages, such as booking confirmations.
