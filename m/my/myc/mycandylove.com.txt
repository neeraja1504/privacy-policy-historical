Each MEMBER can share personal information on forums accessible by other MEMBERS. Here’s how it works:
Any MEMBER can view Forum discussions, comments or any other private information that a MEMBER may post to the PLATFORM.

Collection of Information
When you visit our Website we may collect information regarding your visit from your computer. Such information helps us to determine information about how you found our Website, the date that you visited our Website and search engines that may have led you to our Website. We collect this information in order to continually improve and enhance the functionality of www.mycandylove.com
Generally, you may provide us with two types of information, User Content, which may include Personal Information, and Website Usage Information, both of which are discussed in greater detail below.
Retention of Information
Your Personal Information may be retained for the period of your ongoing use plus up to three years after you expressly terminate your membership or your account is dormant for a period of four months. The tracking cookies may be retained for the period of your ongoing use after such termination or dormancy. Such retention periods may be extended if mandated by law or otherwise required for the protection of our rights.
Children under age 13
This website is not directed to children under the age of 13 years. If you are under the age of 13, you are not allowed to use this site. We recommend that, if you are under 13, you should be smart and not provide any information on your identity, physical location or online contact information unless you do so under your parent’s consent and supervision.
Personal Information You Choose to Provide
In order to make your visits to our Website as enjoyable as possible, we may ask you for Personal Information. Personal Information includes, for example, your email address, which you are asked to provide when registering with BEEMOOV. Below is a description of some of the ways that you may provide Personal Information to us, as well as further details on how we may use such Personal Information.
1. Sign-Up Information and Profile
You provide us with Personal Information, such as your email address, when you register a Member account with the Website. You may also choose to add information to your profile.
2. Contact Us/Feedback
If you email us at support@beemoov.com, we may ask you for information such as your name and email address so we can respond to your questions and comments. If you choose to correspond with us via email, we may retain the content of your email messages, your email address and our response to you. In certain cases, and with your permission, we may post content from your emails to us on the BEEMOOV Website.
3. Questionnaires and Surveys
We may occasionally ask users of our Website to complete online surveys and opinion polls about their activities, attitudes and interests. These surveys help us better serve you and improve the usefulness of BEEMOOV. In requesting your participation in these surveys we may ask you to provide your name and email address to us.
4. User Content
Our Website offers its users the opportunity to share User Content – for instance, on your user profile, status, the forum and through private messages. If you choose to use these features, you should be aware that any Personal Information you submit through these features can be read, collected, or used by other viewers of these forums and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the Personal Information you choose to submit in these forums.
5. Import Contacts
We may utilize an “import contacts” feature to help you keep in touch with your contacts and other members. This may make it easier for you to invite people from your email address book to join you on our Website. If implemented, you can manually import a file from your email program or you can provide us with your email username and password and the BEEMOOV program will import your email contacts for you.
If you import your contacts, we may ask you if you wish to invite or follow your colleagues from your same domain. If you indicate that you would like to follow them, we will send them an invitation from you (with a return address of support@beemoov.com) to activate a BEEMOOV account and join the same domain network as you. We may also send one reminder message after the original invitation if we do not hear back from them. People you invite to join the Website may opt out of receiving further emails from BEEMOOV as described in the Rights to Opt In/Opt Out section below.
Website Usage Information
1. Cookies
We may use “cookies” on or in connection with our Website to maintain information about you. A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. BEEMOOV employs the use of both “session” cookies and “persistent” cookies. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Website. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser’s directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser.
When you visit our Website, our computer may ask your computer for permission to employ the use of a session or persistent cookie. Our Website will then send a cookie to your browser if your browser’s preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits our Website to access the cookies it has already sent to you and not the cookies sent to you by other websites.
Most web browsers can be adjusted to inform you when a cookie has been sent to you and provide you with the opportunity to refuse that cookie. However, refusing a cookie may, in some cases, preclude you from using, or negatively impact the display or function of, our Website or certain areas or features of our Website.
We work with business partners who provide advertising, technology services and other that goods and services to make your visit more interesting. We permit such business partners to add cookies to your computer and track your use of their information or services. We require such business partners to respect our privacy policy.
2. IP Address and Clickstream Data
Our servers automatically collect data about your Internet Protocol address when you visit us. When you request pages from our Website, our servers may log your IP Address and sometimes your domain name. Our server may also record the referring page that linked you to us (e.g., another website or a search engine); the pages you visit on this Website; the website you visit after this Website; other information about the type of web browser, computer, platform, related software and settings you are using; any search terms you have entered on this Website or a referral website; and other web usage activity and data logged by our web servers. We use this information for internal system administration, to help diagnose problems with our servers and to administer our Website. Such information may also be used to gather broad demographic information, such as country of origin and Internet Service Provider. We may also link this information with Personal Information.
Any or all of these activities with regard to the above-described Website Usage Information may be performed on our behalf by our third-party service providers. (See “Sharing Information with Third Parties” section below).

If you choose to import your address book contacts as part of BEEMOOV’s invitation process, we may store those names and emails and display them to other MEMBERS in a forum on the Website in order to customize the Service for you and to enable you and coworkers in your Network to generate subsequent invitations. We may send you notices (for example, in the form of emails, mailings, and the like), and otherwise correspond with you, about products, services, companies, events, sponsored by us and others, that we think might interest you. You may opt out of receiving such notices from us by following the instructions in the Rights to Opt In/Opt Out section above.
In addition, we may analyze user behavior as a measure of interest in, and use of, our Website and emails, both on an individual basis and in the aggregate. BEEMOOV will not share, rent or sell your Personal Information to other parties, except as provided in this Privacy Policy.

Third-Party Websites
When you are on this Website you may have the opportunity to visit, or link to, other websites, including other websites operated by BEEMOOV or by unaffiliated third parties.

Security
BEEMOOV and our partners uses commercially reasonable and industry standard physical, managerial and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your Personal Information. We also use Secure Sockets Layer (BEEMOOV’s business partners, who permit purchases undertaken by players, use SSL technology) encryption to transmit sensitive information. While BEEMOOV endeavors to protect the security and integrity of sensitive Personal Information provided to this Website, due to the inherent nature of the Internet as an open global communications vehicle, we cannot guarantee that information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, will be safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers.
If you contact us by email or a “contact us” or similar feature on the Website, you should be aware that your transmission might not be secure. An unaffiliated third party could view information you send by these methods in transit. We will have no liability for disclosure of your information due to errors or unauthorized acts of third parties during or after transmission.
In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your Personal Information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development. If a notification is appropriate, we would endeavor to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and, to the extent we have your email address, we may notify you by email. You consent to our use of email as a means of such notification. If you prefer for us to use another method to notify you in this situation, please email us at support@beemoov.com with the alternative contact information you wish to be used.
