To download and/or print this Privacy Policy ( "Privacy Policy" ), click here
Welcome! This Privacy Policy describes how My College Options, Inc. ( “myCollegeOptions,” “we,” “us,” “our,” etc.) collects, uses, and shares information about you, including the choices myCollegeOptions offers with respect to that information, in connection with (a) the “Personal Profile Information” (defined below) you provide during "Registration” (defined below), and (b) your use of the “myOptions Program” (defined below).
Registration Registration for the myOptions Program consists of the completion and submission of an online or offline form distributed to U.S. secondary schools; OR directly accessing the Program online via the Service (defined below). By registering for the Program, you consent to our collection, use and disclosure practices, and other activities as described in this Privacy Policy, and any additional privacy statements that may be posted on an applicable part of a Registration form or Service information collection page. If you do not agree and consent, do not participate in the myOptions Program or access or use the Service. Our program is entirely voluntary and not required by your school.
Personal Profile Information Your Personal Profile Information means the Personal Information and Demographic Information you provide when registering for the Program AND any updates you make to your Personal Profile Information online via the Service.
The myOptions Program The myOptions Program ( “Program” ) refers to the Registration process, subsequent updates to your Personal Profile Information, use of the myoptions.org, mycollegeoptions.org, admitted.ly and/or admittedly.com websites, the myOptions mobile app, and any other online service location (e.g., website or mobile app) that posts a link to this Privacy Policy ( “Service” ), regardless of how you access or use it, whether via computer, mobile device, consumer electronics device, or otherwise. The Program includes mycollegeoptions, mycareeroptions, myscholarshipoptions and such other program components as we may add from time to time.
By viewing, accessing, registering, creating an account or otherwise using the Program, you agree to our Terms of Use and consent to our collection, use and disclosure practices, and other activities as described in this Privacy Policy, and any additional privacy statements that may be posted on an applicable part of the Program. If you do not agree and consent, discontinue use of the Program, and uninstall Program downloads and applications.
Our Data Practices The most important benefit of registering for the Program is that we use and share your information to help you connect with colleges, universities and other providers of Education-related Products and Services (defined below) so you can receive information and resources directly from them and through this program. Information you and your family may receive includes information from colleges and universities, as well as other Education-related Products and Services such as: (a) student loans and financial aid, college admissions and tutorial services, extra-curricular enrichment and recognition programs; (b) career, employment and military opportunities; and (c) camps from non-profit organizations, companies offering educational products & services, and government agencies. My College Options, Inc. is a non-profit educational organization and will not share your Personal Profile Information with commercial marketers for the purpose of offering to sell you non-Education-related Products and Services without your consent.

Return to Navigation
3. ### Use of Information
We may use information about you, including Personal Profile Information and other Personal Information, for purposes permitted by applicable law and not inconsistent with this Privacy Policy or written statements we have made when collecting Personal Information from you, including without limitation:
1. Allow you to participate in the features and services we offer;
2. Facilitate, manage, personalize and improve your experience;

4. ### Sharing of Information
We may share non-Personal Information, and Personal Information that is not deemed your Personal Profile Information hereunder, with third parties for any purpose as permitted by applicable law and not inconsistent with this Privacy Policy or written statements we have made when collecting Personal Information from you.

5. ### Co-branded Pages, Third Party Services, Advertising and Analytics
From time to time, our Service may include co-branded pages, or sections of a page, related to one of our marketing partners. We will try to show clearly, by placing our marketing partner's name or logo in a prominent place or otherwise, whether a page, or section of a page, is co-branded. If you provide your information on or through one of these co-branded opportunities, the information you submit (which may include pulling from your Personal Profile Information if you so elect) may be shared by you with that marketing partner, and it may associate its own Tracking Technologies with you. In such case, that party's privacy policy and its terms and conditions of use apply to you with respect to that third party. Some of these marketing partners may be commercial marketers, or have relationships with commercial marketers, so by sharing your information with them, you may be consenting to receive direct marketing that is not restricted to Educational-related Products and Services.
The Service may also include hyperlinks to, or include on or in connection with the Service (e.g., apps and plug-ins), websites, locations, platforms, applications or services operated by third parties ( “Third Party Service(s)” ). These Third-Party Services may use their Tracking Technology to independently collect information about you and may solicit Personal Information from you.
Certain functionalities on the Service permit interactions that you initiate between the Service and certain Third-Party Services, such as third party social networks ( “Social Features” ). Examples of Social Features include: enabling you to send content such as contacts and photos between the Service and a Third Party Service; “liking” or “sharing” our content; logging in to the Service using your Third Party Service account (e.g., using Facebook Connect to sign-in to the Service); and to otherwise connect the Service to a Third Party Service (e.g., to pull or push information to or from the Service). If you use Social Features, and potentially other Third-Party Services, information you post or provide access to may be publicly displayed on the Service or by the Third Party Service that you use. Similarly, if you post information on a third-party service that references the Service (e.g., by using a hashtag associated with myCollegeOptions in a tweet or status update), your post may be used on or in connection with the Service or otherwise by us. Also, both myCollegeOptions and the third party may have access to certain information about you and your use of the Service and any Third-Party Service.
Our Service may engage and work with Service Providers and other third parties to serve advertisements on the Service, and/or on third-party services. Some of these ads may be tailored to your interests based on your browsing of the Service and elsewhere on the Internet over time, sometimes referred to as “interest-based advertising” and “online behavioral advertising” ( “Interest-based Advertising” ), which may include sending you an ad on a third party service after you have left the Service (i.e., “retargeting”). See Section 10 for information on certain choices offered by third parties regarding Interest-based Advertising.
Our Service may use Google Analytics and other Service Providers for analytics services. These analytics services may use cookies and other Tracking Technologies to help us analyze Service users and how they use the Service. Information generated by these services (e.g., your IP address and other Usage Information) may be transmitted to and stored by these Service Providers on servers in the U.S. (or elsewhere) and these Service Providers may use this information for purposes such as evaluating your use of the Service, compiling statistic reports on the Service’s activity, and providing other services relating to Service activity and other Internet usage. See Section 10 for information on certain choices offered by Google Analytics and other third parties regarding analytics.
Except to the extent we combine information from Service Providers, Third-Party Services or other third parties with Personal Profile Information, in which case we will treat the combined information as Personal Profile Information under this Privacy Policy (See Section 2.C), data obtained by us from a third party, even in association with the Service, is not subject to our limitations regarding Personal Profile Information under this Privacy Policy. Otherwise, the information collected, stored and shared by third parties remains subject to their privacy policies and practices, including whether they continue to share information with us, the types of information shared, and your choices on what is visible to others on third-party services.
We are not responsible for and make no representations regarding the policies or business practices of any third parties, including without limitation, analytics Service Providers and Third-Party Services associated with the Service, and encourage you to familiarize yourself with and consult their privacy policies and terms of use. See Section 10 for more on certain choices offered by some third parties regarding their data collection and use, including regarding Interest-based Advertising and Analytics.

6. ### Data Security and Monitoring
We take reasonable measures to protect Personal Profile Information from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. Nevertheless, transmission via the internet and online digital storage are not completely secure and we cannot guarantee the security of your information collected through the Service. To help protect you and others, we and our Service Providers may (but make no commitment to) monitor use of the Service, and may collect and use related information including Personal Profile Information and other Personal Information for all purposes not prohibited by applicable law or inconsistent with this Privacy Policy, including without limitation, to identify fraudulent activities and transactions; prevent abuse of and investigate and/or seek prosecution for any potential threats to or misuse of the Service; ensure compliance with the Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy; investigate violations of or enforce these agreements; and otherwise to protect the rights and property of myCollegeOptions, its partners, and members. Monitoring may result in the collection, recording, and analysis of online activity or communications through our Service. If you do not consent to these conditions, you must discontinue your use of the Service.

7. ### International Transfer
The myOptions Program is based in the U.S. and the information we and our Service Providers collect is governed by U.S. law. If you are accessing the Service from outside of the U.S., please be aware that information collected through the Service may be transferred to, processed, stored and used in the U.S. Data protection laws in the U.S. may be different from those of your country of residence. Your use of the Service or provision of any information therefore constitutes your consent to the transfer to and from, processing, usage, sharing and storage of your information, including Personal Information, in the U.S. as set forth in this Privacy Policy.

8. ### Children
The Service is intended for a general audience and not directed to children less than 13 years of age. The Program does not intend to collect personal information as defined by the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act ( “COPPA” ) ( Children’s Personal Information ) in a manner that is not permitted by COPPA. If you are a parent or guardian and believe we have collected Children’s Personal Information in a manner not permitted by COPPA, please contact us here and we will remove such data to the extent required by COPPA.
Any California residents under the age of eighteen (18) who have registered to use the Service, and who posted content or information on the Service, can request removal by contacting myCollegeOptions here, detailing where the content or information is posted and attesting that you posted it. myCollegeOptions will then make reasonable good faith efforts to remove the post from prospective public view or anonymize it so the minor cannot be individually identified to the extent required by applicable law. This removal process cannot ensure complete or comprehensive removal. For instance, third-parties may have republished or archived content by search engines and others that myCollegeOptions does not control.
Return to Navigation
9. ### Accessing and Changing Your Information
We may provide web pages or other mechanisms allowing you to delete, correct or update your Personal Profile Information. California minors should see “Children” at Section 8 regarding removal of certain content they have posted on the Service. We will make good faith efforts to make requested changes in the myCollegeOptions then-active databases as soon as practicable, but it is not always possible to completely change, remove or delete all of your information or postings from our databases and residual and/or cached data may remain archived thereafter. Further, we reserve the right to retain data (a) as required by applicable law; and (b) for so long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes for which the data is retained except to the extent prohibited by applicable law.

11. ### Your California Privacy Rights
California’s “Shine the Light” law permits customers in California to request certain details about how certain types of their information are shared with third parties and, in some cases, affiliates, for those third parties’ and affiliates’ own direct marketing purposes. Under the law, a business should either provide California customers certain information upon request or permit California customers to opt in to, or opt out of, this type of sharing.
We provide California residents with the option to opt-out of sharing “personal information” as defined by California’s “Shine the Light” law with third parties for such third parties’ own direct marketing purposes. California residents may exercise that opt-out, and/or request information about our compliance with the “Shine the Light” law by contacting us here  or by sending a letter to My College Options, Inc., 3651 NE Ralph Powell Rd., Lee’s Summit, MO 64064 (Attn: Privacy Coordinator/Legal Compliance). Requests must include “California Privacy Rights Request” in the first line of the description and include your name, street address, city, state, and ZIP code. Please note that we are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through the provided email address or mailing address.
The Program discloses its tracking practices (including across time and third-party services) in Section 2.B and its practices regarding “Do not track” signals in Section 10.A. California minors should see “Children’s Privacy Policy” at Section 8 regarding removal of certain content they have posted on the Service.

12. ### Changes to the Privacy Policy
We reserve the right to revise and reissue this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting of the revised Privacy Policy, but material changes will only apply prospectively, and we will not use previously collected Personal Information in a way materially different than the Privacy Policy in effect at the time of collection, unless you otherwise consent. Your continued use of the program or Service indicates your consent to the Privacy Policy then posted. If you do not agree, discontinue use of the Service and uninstall Service downloads.
