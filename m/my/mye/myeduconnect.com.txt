What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?
This Privacy Policy covers Vast Interactive’s treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that Vast Interactive gathers when you are accessing Vast Interactive Sites and when you use Vast Interactive services. Also, this Privacy Policy covers Vast Interactive’s treatment of any Personal Information that Vast Interactive’s business partners share with Vast Interactive. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the use of your Personal Information by third parties to which such information is provided by Vast Interactive that Vast Interactive does not own or control, or to individuals that Vast Interactive does not employ or manage.
What Personal Information Does Vast Interactive Collect And Maintain?
We collect the following types of information from our customers:
Personal Information You Provide to Us:
We receive and store any information you enter on Vast Interactive Sites or provide to us in any other way. The types of Personal Information collected may include name, address, phone number, and email address. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as responding to your requests for certain products and services, customizing the advertising and content you see, and communicating with you about specials and new products.
Personal Information Collected Automatically:
We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with Vast Interactive Sites or services. Vast Interactive automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information, and the page you requested.
Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to Vast Interactive Sites and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show. Vast Interactive uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the Vast Interactive Sites or services so that we can make the Vast Interactive Sites appealing to as many customers as possible, and improve those services. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our customers use Vast Interactive Sites. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use their services and Vast Interactive Sites, so that they, too, may seek to provide you with an optimal online experience.
Many companies offer programs that help you to visit Web sites anonymously. While Vast Interactive will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these programs are available.
What About Cookies?
Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in Vast Interactive Sites are visited and by how many people. Vast Interactive and its affiliated third parties may use cookies that collect Personal Information, and we may combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or email address is.
Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of Vast Interactive Sites’ most attractive features.
