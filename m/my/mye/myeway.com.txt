We collect corporate information, including your company name, website, email address, type of business and ABN.
We collect personal information such as your name, email address, telephone number, address, credit card information and date of birth.
The information we collect (whether personal or corporate) is collected in one or more of these ways:
through disclosure of such information by you through eWAY’s website;
over the phone to an eWAY representative; or
from a third party engaged by you (such as a web developer).
Where information is provided to us by a third party engaged by you, we are typically only provided with your name, phone number and/or email address.
We collect personal and corporate information for the purpose of providing you with eWAY’s payment gateway product and a high level of customer service.
Any communication with us (regardless of mode) is recorded and stored in order to provide service references, ensure compliance with our service standards and to assist in our staff training and development initiatives.

In order to use this Website, you must first complete the registration form and create a username and password. During registration you must provide us with certain personal information (such as name and Email address). We use this information to contact you about the services on our site in which you have expressed interest.

engage in direct marketing to you (in any medium);
testimonials and client/ partner listings on our website and within marketing materials; and
inform third parties other than financial institutions who provide us services – we do not however provide personal information to such third parties, without your prior consent.
Where we disclose your personal or corporate information to third parties, it is solely for the purpose of such third parties establishing your merchant account and processing payments, unless otherwise stated.
We have subsidiaries in the UK, New Zealand, U.S.A. and Canada and so we may disclose your personal and corporate information to recipients in these regions.

COOKIES
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s technical information.  In general, we use the information that is collected through the use of cookies on our Site to make the Site more useful to you and to tailor your experience with us and our communications with you to meet your special interests and needs.
Some of the ways in which we use cookies may include the following:
When you register for any of eWAY’s services, we use cookies to make it easier for you to navigate through and complete the registration form.
When you login to MYeWAY, we use cookies to easily authorise your credentials as you navigate through our secure pages.
If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site, such as our administration area, may be limited.
Some of our business partners (e.g. advertisers) use cookies on our site. We have no access to, or control over, these cookies.
This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by this site only and does not cover the use of cookies by any third party, whether or not affiliated with eWAY.
COMMUNICATIONS
eWAY uses your personal information for essential communications, such as confirmation Emails, accounts information, and critical service details. We may also use this information for other purposes, including direct marketing. If at any time you wish not to receive such correspondence, you may request to be removed from any mailing lists by emailing us at compliance@eway.io.

CLEAR GIFS (WEB BEACONS /WEB BUGS)
Our third party advertising partner, such as Google Adwords and third party tracking utility partners may employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.
To learn more about our advertising company’s use of clear gifs, please go to https://adwords.google.com
FORUM
If you use the eWAY forum on this site, you should be aware that any personal information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in these forums.

We reserve the right to disclose your personal information as required or permitted by law (including Privacy Law) and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process.
TESTIMONIALS
We may post customer testimonials on our website which may contain personal information such as the customer’s name. We will obtain your consent to use your personal information prior to posting the testimonial.

PARTNER’S DIRECTORY
eWAY provides free-of-charge a directory for associated partners to join. eWAY associated partners generally include third party applications that contribute to the functionality of the Gateway Services. The process of registering for the partner directory is initiated and completed entirely by the partner, with all information submitted by the partner.

STORAGE OF COLLECTED INFORMATION
The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
If you have any questions about security on our Website, you can email us at compliance@eway.io.
