1.1 Collection of personal information by third parties
We may also collect personal information from third parties including public sources, Information service providers, providers who administer Myer products and services such as payment cards and insurance and anyone authorised to act on your behalf.
Certain brands, businesses and third parties that operate in a Myer store or online own the personal information you provide to them (eg when you join their mailing list, or recording your product preferences), and therefore have their own privacy policy which we encourage you to read before providing your personal information. Myer is not responsible for the privacy practices of these third parties and this Policy does not apply to them. Certain third parties conducting health related services (eg breast screening, weight loss services, or optometry services) may collect sensitive information.
Where you provide personal information to our approved third parties (such as Myer branded credit card provider), we may use this information to update and correct your details in your MYER one account (including your Additional Cardholder).
You can help us keep your information up to date, by letting us know about changes to your details or by updating your account details by signing in.
