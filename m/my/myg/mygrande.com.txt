Abuse of Appropriate Use Policy
We have the right to share your name and contact information with our attorneys and law enforcement officials, if needed, in the event we believe you have breached our Appropriate Use Policy or otherwise harmed us or any of our customers in any way.
Law Enforcement
Legal Requirements - As a provider of Internet communications services, we regularly receive legal requests for customer information from government and law enforcement personnel. We also receive discovery requests in civil litigation. In all such cases, our policy is to cooperate as required by law, but to provide only such information as the law requires. This information is generally sought by subpoena served on Grande Communications. Under current law, many criminal subpoenas require that we not disclose or notify you of the request. Due to this fact and the volume of requests we receive, we cannot assume any duty to notify you of receipt of any legal requests.
Internet Information - Current law provides that personal account and other information concerning use of our internet services may be subpoenaed by governmental entities. In such cases, you may not be entitled to notice of such a request. The content of internet communications may not generally be sought through use of a subpoena. The law does permit us to disclose to law enforcement, voluntarily and without prior notice, customer information, including the contents of communications, if we reasonably believe that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury requires such disclosure without delay.
Telephone Information - In some areas, Grande Communications provides telephone services to its customers. Current law requires law enforcement to obtain a court order or warrant for a telephone wiretap or to use a pen register or trap and trace device to capture dialing information.

Although our Site is not specifically directed toward children, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from persons under the age of 13 on our Site, we recognize that parents and children visit the Site.

Please visitwww.ftc.gov/kidsprivacy for information from the Federal Trade Commission about protecting children's privacy online.
Policy regarding Children's Use of Site
We recommend that an adult accompany children when using content on the Site.
Grande Communications will never knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of 13. If Grande Communications obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personal information about a child under the age of 13, that information will be deleted from our system.
Prospective users between the ages of 13 and 17 can only use the Site under their parents' or legal guardian's supervision. If you are between the ages of 13 and 17, you, your parent, or your legal guardian may request that we delete any of your personal information in our database and/or opt-out from receiving communications from us.

Implementation of Children's Privacy Statement
A user is never required to disclose any personal information to visit the Site. Personal information is never collected from users who do not sign up for the Site or one of our services. Until registration has been completed, our system does not actually store any personal information.
Grande Communications does not substantively monitor our public areas except to determine compliance with our Appropriate Use Policy and Privacy Statement. We do not require any user to disclose personal information to use the public areas of the Site. If we obtain actual knowledge that a child under the age of 13 has disclosed personal information in a public area of our Site, we will delete any personally identifying information from the public area and from our system.
Grande Communications cannot prevent a child under the age of 13 from sending emails. However, if Grande Communications obtains actual knowledge that an email comes from a child under the age of 13, our customer service staff is trained to initiate our internal COPPA compliance process which includes the deletion from our system of all personal information about the child, including the email address.
Grande Communications may occasionally run contests or sweepstakes. Like our general registration, sweepstakes and contests are not open to children under the age of 13. Any registration for a contest or sweepstakes likewise requests the age of the entrant. If we learn that the entrant is less than 13, the entry will be deleted. Whenever the Site requests personal information from a visitor before the visitor can participate in an activity, the visitor is not required to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity.
Changes to Children's Privacy Statement
If Grande Communications changes its policy with respect to the collection of personal information about children under the age of 13, the changes will be posted here and will take effect immediately upon posting.
