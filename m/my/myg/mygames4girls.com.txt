Privacy Policy - My Games 4 Girls
Read our Privacy Policy.
The 05/01/2017
Drimlike Ltd (“Drimlike”, “we”, “our” or “us”) respects the privacy rights of our online visitors and mobile customers and recognizes the importance of protecting the information collected about you. For our practices regarding children, please see below.
ABOUT THIS PRIVACY POLICY
This Privacy Policy (the “Privacy Policy”) applies to the collection, use and disclosure of personal and non-personal information by Drimlike and its affiliates through the mygames4girls.com, juegosxachicas.com and jeux2filles.fr websites (the “Sites”), the mobile apps published by Drimlike (the “Apps”) and Hidolls program (the “Programs”) (in this Privacy Policy, the Sites, Apps and Programs are referred to collectively as the “Platforms”). This Privacy Policy does not apply to the collection, use or disclosure of personal and non-personal information through any apps for which Drimlike is not the publisher.
By using the Platforms, you signify your assent to our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not use any of our Platforms.
We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time. Please check the Privacy Policy each time you use our Platforms to ensure you are aware of any changes in our privacy practices. Our Privacy Policy will indicate the date it was last updated. Your continued use of our Platforms will signify your acceptance of the changes to our Privacy Policy. If there is a substantive or material change in the way that we use your personal information, we will notify you via email of the relevant changes or provide other prominent notice. If you choose to opt-out of or not opt-in to our changed practice, our email communication (if applicable) will contain instructions on how to do so. If such change affects children users, we will first notify and obtain the prior verifiable consent of a parent or legal guardian.
HOW WE PROTECT THE ONLINE PRIVACY OF CHILDREN UNDER 13
Drimlike takes many precautions to protect the online privacy of children. Whenever we refer to “children” in this Privacy Policy, we mean children under the age of 13. Please help us in protecting children’s privacy by instructing them to never provide any personal information (full name, email address, home address, phone number, etc.) without your permission.
Drimlike follows the principles of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), a U.S. law designed to protect the online privacy of children, in our online services and Apps that are directed to children. If you would like to learn more about COPPA, you can refer to the “Children’s Privacy” section of the Federal Trade Commission’s website.
Currently, Drimlike does not knowingly collect any personal information from children or within the child-directed portions of our Platforms except as otherwise outlined in this Privacy Policy. If we were to collect and store personal information from children, we would obtain the consent of a parent or legal guardian before such collection, unless the collection of information falls within an exception that is permitted under COPPA.
Parents who have registered their child to Hidolls Program should understand that information, including but not limited to a child’s first name, last name’s initial, country of residence and behavioral activity within the app, may be collected by Drimlike. In addition, any feedback provided by users may be used to make adjustments to and improve upon Drimlike products including but not limited to the gameplay, app flow, story, art and animation.
In our Apps directed to children users, we collect information which includes persistent identifiers such as a device identifier (“device ID”) or an Internet Protocol address (“IP address”). This information is collected solely for the purpose of providing functionality and support for our internal operations and optimizing our users’ game experience.
Drimlike does not permit behaviorally-targeted advertising to children in the Apps or in the Platforms where we have actual knowledge that the user is under the age of 13.
If you believe that we may have unintentionally collected your child’s personal information without your prior consent, you may contact Drimlike’ Privacy Officer:

INFORMATION COLLECTED BY DRIMLIKE
There are two types of information that may be collected by Drimlike. The first is called personal information which is information that can be used to identify a specific individual. As stated in the previous section, Drimlike does not knowingly collect any personal information from children outside of the information required for the support of internal operations. Drimlike may collect personal information that parents, legal guardians or persons over 13 voluntarily provide on the Platforms. The second type of information is non-personal information which doesn’t directly identify an individual. Drimlike may collect non-personal information about your use of the Platforms to help us improve our services or for other purposes as described in this Privacy Policy.
We may combine the non-personal and personal information you provide us through our Platforms. Information collected will vary depending upon the activity and may include your name, email address, phone number, mobile number, device type, operating system, home address, birth date, statistical and usage data (as further explained below), proof of identify of contest prize winners and, to the extent required to process any payment, your credit card information. In addition, we may collect demographic information such as gender, zip code or postal code and other data that you may provide in surveys or online profiles, for instance. We may combine demographic information with personal information.
PURPOSES FOR WHICH WE USE THE INFORMATION COLLECTED
Drimlike may use the personal information you provide us for the purposes of (1) administering contests and awarding prizes which are only directed to parents and adult users, (2) warranty registration and/or providing customer support or responding to technical service requests, (3) providing online services for parents and users over 13, (4) registration for games or special game-specific event participation for parents and users over 13, (5) registration for membership and participation on our Sites or in our Hidolls program, (6) processing your order(s) of products or subscriptions from us online, (7) responding to or forwarding your request(s) for services from third party service providers on our Sites; (8) enabling your use of our software or online services and access to certain areas of our Sites, features or programs; (9) beta-testing; (10) newsletter sign-up or (11) improving our products and services. You are not required to provide personal information to us to obtain access to any of our Platforms; however, the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information is required for registration to access certain areas or features of our Platforms and, if you do not provide the required information, you will not have access to these areas or features.
Statistical and Usage Data : When you use our Apps on your device, we may retrieve information about your hardware system and how your game is played, including your IP address or device ID. We may also collect information about your computer, hardware, software, platform, media, connection, information about online activity such as feature usage, game play statistics and scores, user rankings, click paths, and in-app purchases. We use this information to enable you to play our game over the Internet. We also use this information to better understand the behavior and preferences of our customers, so that we can improve our products and services. We work with a third party analytics company (Google Analytics - https://www.google.com/analytics/analytics/) to help us collect and analyze this information with the goal of improving our Platforms and providing you with the best services.
Other Uses : We may also use your information for other legitimate business purposes. Whatever the purpose may be, we will only collect information to the extent reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected and our legitimate business objectives or as permitted or required by law.

Internet Protocol Address : We collect an IP address from every visitor to our Platforms. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer or device when you use the Internet. We use IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our servers, administer our Platforms, analyze trends, track users’ movement on our Platforms, gather broad demographic information for aggregate use in order for us to improve the Platforms, and deliver customized, personalized content. We do not link IP addresses with any personally identifiable information.
In-Game Advertising : Our Platforms may incorporate dynamic advertisement serving technology offered by our Ad Providers, which enables advertising to be temporarily uploaded into the game and replaced while you play. The data collected for this purpose may include IP address or players’ user name, downloaded or purchased Apps, in game location, length of time an advertisement was visible, size of the advertisements, and angle of view. The Apps you are using may be assigned an ID number, which is stored on your device, and used by our Ad Providers to calculate the number of unique and repeat views of dynamic in-game/web advertising. The ID number is not associated with any personal data and for children-directed Apps is not used for behavioral advertising purposes. None of the information collected and used for advertising purposes is used to personally identify you. The servers used by the Ad Providers may be located outside your country of residence. This ad serving technology is integrated into the Apps/Sites; if you do not want to use this technology, do not play the Apps or use our Sites while connected to the Internet.
