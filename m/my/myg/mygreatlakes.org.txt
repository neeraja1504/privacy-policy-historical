A cookie enables the website to keep track of a user's activity and preferences within the website. Great Lakes does not share the information contained in cookies with unrelated third parties and does not allow unrelated third parties to set cookies on user computers. This means other parties cannot collect your personally identifiable information when you use our website.

You will be required to provide some information and other information that is requested may be provided at your option.

Children's Online Privacy Protection Act
Great Lakes does not intend to obtain information from children under 13 years of age. If we learn that we have collected information from a child under 13, we will promptly take all reasonable steps to delete the information. If a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, a parent or guardian may contact us and we will remove the information.

Privacy Statement Changes
In the future, we may need to change our privacy statement. All changes will be made here so that you will always know what information we gather, how we use that information, and in what form and under what circumstances we will disclose it to another party. This policy is effective when it's posted on this website and will be reviewed from time to time.
