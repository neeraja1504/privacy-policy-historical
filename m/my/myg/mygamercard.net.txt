(Please note that MyGamerCard is not directly owned, operated, or affiliated with Microsoft and their LIVE Services, and this information is provided only as a courtesy.)
The Way We Use Information
We use User-Provided Data and Publicly Available Information in various ways.
User-Provided Data is used to communicate with you about your account, fulfill elgibility of Events, and generate statistical data for our own use. We may also provide aggregate data to Advertisers. An example of this would be to report the percentage of users in an age bracket and/or gender. Please see the 'Advertisers' section below for more complete information of how we use Advertising on MyGamerCard. Any information identified as User-Provided Data will never be disclosed to any third party without the explicit consent of the Account Holder.
MyGamerCard obtains Publicly Available Information through Site visitors who request information on a GamerTag in some shape or form. This may include the display of the GamerCard or Profile, or searching the GamerTag on statistical areas of the site such as Leaderboards or GamerPic information. Publicly Available Information is the heart of MyGamerCard, and is used extensively for analytical, statistical, ranking, reporting and historical purposes. Examples of these purposes include (not an exhaustive list):
Calculating an average GamerScore in a game
Displaying the total number of users using a specific GamerPicture
Ordering a list of GamerTags by their GamerScore
Displaying all known played games for a GamerTag
Displaying current players in a specific game
Tracking changes to Console Locale
Please refer to any specific section of our website to learn more about how that application uses Publicly Available Information.
Some of this Publicly Available Information can be hidden from MyGamerCard, and will not be used. A list of these datapoints is displayed in the 'Data Classification: Publicly Available Information' section above. Note that any historical data that was once Public is still considered such and may not be removed, even after that datapoint has been hidden.
Data Removal
The removal of your account and information from MyGamerCard is provided at the request of a user, with some exceptions. The removal of your account signifies your wish to no longer actively use services provided by MyGamerCard. To that end, we will keep your email and GamerTag on file so that it cannot be used again, much like an 'opt-out' procedure. Note that this service is not provided to users whose accounts have been Banned for any reason.
Members that wish to have multiple accounts linked to their multiple GamerTags, or those that have changed their GamerTag, will need to set up a separate account using a separate email address.
Publicly Available Information is public by definition, and therefore will not be removed or altered, with exception of data transmission or reporting errors from our data providers. What constitutes a reporting error is made at the sole discretion of MyGamerCard, but as an example, includes information such as GamerScore that exceeds the current maximum ceiling, based on available games.
Out Commitment To Data Security
Protection of your information from unauthorized access is top priority. MyGamerCard employs reasonable, industry-standard hardware, software, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect and store.
How To Access Or Correct User-Provided Data
Accuracy of information is important. You can change some of your information by logging into your User Profile (through 'My MGC'). For personally identifiable information that is not alterable on our website, you can send us a request that credibly shows error. To protect your privacy and security, we may require proof of identity before making corrections, especially if those corrections result in access to your account.
Modifications To This Policy
This policy may be modified at any time, without announcement. The current revision date will always be clearly displayed in the header of this content box, and at the end of the Policy. Continued use of MyGamerCard signifies your acceptance and understanding of the Policy. If, for any reason, you do not agree with the Policy after any changes
