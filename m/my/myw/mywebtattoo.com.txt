Safe Web Products Privacy Policy
Effective Date: August 29, 2012
Thank you for visiting our website ("Site"). The Site is an Internet property of Safe Web Products, LLC ("SWP," "we" or "us"). SWP has created this Safe Web Products Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") in order to disclose our information gathering and dissemination practices. We understand the importance that Internet users place on privacy and have designed our Site with this in mind. You agree to this Privacy Policy, in its entirety, and consent to the use of your personal information as contemplated herein, when you: (a) access or use the Site; and/or (b) use any of our proprietary web-based graphics, text, images, audio files, artwork and/or other content (collectively, "Content"). Please be advised that, as a policy, other than with respect to the limited exceptions set forth below, SWP does not collect your personally identifiable information; provided, however, that SWP does collect, in an anonymous way that does not identify you individually, information regarding your browser type, computer operating system, IP address and other similar non-personally identifiable information.
Safe Web Products, LLC is a United States-based limited liability company organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, and all SWP operations are based in the United States. To the extent permitted by applicable law, this Privacy Policy, and SWP's information gathering and dissemination practices, shall be governed generally by the laws of the United States, and specifically by the laws of the State of New York, without regard to New York State's conflict of laws principles. To the extent permitted by applicable law, you expressly disclaim the application of any foreign laws, rules or regulations. Where national and/or international law provides you with the option or requirement to apply the law of your place of residence despite the provisions of this Privacy Policy requiring otherwise, nothing in this Privacy Policy shall prevent you from applying the law of your place of residence. Nothing in this Privacy Policy shall be deemed to affect any statutory or other consumer rights that you may have under local laws that cannot be, or have not been, altered, limited or waived by this Privacy Policy.
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, the practices of the Site, or your dealings with the Site, please contact us via email at:info@safewebproducts.com, or call us at: 1-800-831-8940.

In addition, if you utilize the Content within certain online venues including, but not limited to, social networking websites ("Social Networking Sites"), such Social Networking Site(s) may give you the option to allow SWP to access the user information that you have provided to such Social Networking Site(s).

All collected information is stored in a technically and physically secure environment. Access to end-user information is strictly limited, and not accessible to the public. The practices for handling end-user information are disseminated to all of our employees. Employees not adhering to our policies are subject to disciplinary action. In compliance with applicable federal and state law, we shall notify you and any applicable regulatory agencies in the event that we learn of an information security breach with respect to any of your personally identifiable information that we may have in our possession. Please be advised that notice may be delayed in order to address the needs of law enforcement, determine the scope of network damage, and to engage in remedial measures.
