Removing your personal information
Right to remove:
You have the right to request us to “remove” your personal data. We will respond to your request within a timely manner and we will delete your data but will generally assume that you would prefer us to keep a note of your name on a register of individuals who would prefer not to be contacted. That way, we will minimise the chances of you being contacted in the future where your data are collected in unconnected circumstances. If you would prefer us not to do this, you are free to say so.
We would only be entitled to refuse to comply with your request for one of the following reasons:
for archival, research or statistical purposes
to exercise or defend a legal claim
When complying with a valid request for the removal of data, we will take all reasonably practicable steps to delete the relevant data.
Your personal information and third parties
Contracts with all service providers⁄consultants whose service involves access to personal information comply with the myVMC Privacy Policy.
We do not sell any of your personal data with third parties.
We may share your personal data with third parties for one of two specific purposes:
If you are a competition winner and the third party is posting your prize to you; or
We are employing the use of a mailing house which receive personal information in order to provide a service for myVMC.
In both cases, third parties are required to sign an undertaking that the information will only be used for the purpose for which the information was provided.
Cookies
MyVMC uses cookies to ensure you get the best experience on the website. We use them to analyse how many people are coming to the site and what is most interesting to them so it can guide us in our future educational content development. Our advertisers also use cookies (you will see advertisements in the external banners of the site, each clearly marked as ‘ad’ so it can be distinguished from our referenced educational content) to serve ads which are relevant to your interests. If you continue without changing your settings, we will accept your consent to receive these cookies. However, if you wish to, you can change your browser settings to block or remove cookies at any time. Go to https://ico.org.uk/your-data-matters/online/cookies/ for information on how to do this.
A cookie is a small amount of data, which may include an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to an individual’s browser from a website’s computers and may either be used only during the internet session (a “session” cookie) or may be stored on the individual’s computer hard drive (a “persistent” cookie).
Cookies can contain data about user movement during the visit to a website. If an individual’s browser software is set to allow cookies, a website can send its own cookie to them. A website cannot access cookies sent to the individual by other sites.
myVMC uses cookies to make the individual’s use of the myVMC site and services as enjoyable as possible. Cookies themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user’s browser. Cookies are useful to estimate the number of myVMC site members and determine overall traffic patterns through the website.
An individual can configure their browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify them when a cookie is sent. (Each browser is different, so check the “Help” menu of your browser or go to https://ico.org.uk/your-data-matters/online/cookies/ to learn how to change your cookie preferences.)
Keeping information secure
We invest significant resources to protect your personal information, from loss, misuse, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. However, no internet-based site can be 100% secure and so we cannot be held responsible for unauthorised or unintended access that is beyond our control.
Contact us if you have any questions.
