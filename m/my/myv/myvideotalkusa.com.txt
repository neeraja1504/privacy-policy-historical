How Does MyVideoTalk Use My Information
In the purchase process you are required to provide contact information (such as name, shipping
address, phone number, and email address) . We use this information to communicate with you
about your account, to notify you about important functionality changes to the web site, new
services, and special offers we think you'll find valuable, company emails and newsletters. If we have
trouble processing an order, we use this contact information to get in touch with you. Demographic
information provided at time of purchase process may also be given to the selling representative to
assure quality customer care.
We may disclose aggregated information about our members but that information contains no
personal information. In some situations, we share personal information with third parties who

government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in connection
with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or
may expose us to legal liability.

We make every effort to prevent the loss, misuse, and alteration of our users information under our
control. In addition, we, and our partners, always use a secure connection when collecting personal
financial information from you. However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed
to be 100% secure.
