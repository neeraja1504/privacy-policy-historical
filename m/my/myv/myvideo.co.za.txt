Information we gather
Registration
When you register on MyVideo, we collect and store information that identifies you and your account. At this time you will be required to submit your full name, e-mail address and password.
Online surveys and contests
Occasionally MyVideo conducts an online user survey to collect information about our userâ€™s preferences. The surveys are optional and if you choose to respond, your responses will remain anonymous. Similarly we may offer contests to qualifying users in which we asked for contact and demographic information such as name, e-mail address and mailing address. None of this information is shared with third parties, except in summary form if it all. The information that we collect in the registration process and through online surveys is used to help us improve our services and to meet the needs and preferences of our users. This may include targeted advertising to you about our services. Information we gather through a contest may also be disclosed to third parties if necessary for prize fulfillment and other aspects of any contest or similar offering.

If you use these features, we only use your friend's e-mail addresses on a onetime basis to send the requested posting and we use your e-mail address to copy you on the message or to send on your behalf.
