Once on our mailing list you will get some email updates containing news, blog posts, tips, special offers, promotions which includes or may be classified as marketing. By subscribing, you are agreeing that you are happy for us to send these emails.
Of course, as always, you are free to unsubscribe at any time from our Newsletters and emails as every email contains a link to unsubscribe at the bottom.
We use MailChimp to collect and store the contact details and send the Newsletters and email updates. Please read Mailchimps Privacy Policy and Terms of Use. If you unsubscribe and wish to delete all records of your previous subscription contact Mailchimp or send us an email with the title ( unsubscribe) so we can remove them.
Any information like your email address is totally private and will not be sold or shared. Promise.
