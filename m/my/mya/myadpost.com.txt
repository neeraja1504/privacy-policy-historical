What personally identifiable information is collected from you
The my Adpost collects information in several ways from different parts of our web site.
Some personal information is gathered when you register. During registration, we ask for your name and email address. The system will also ask for your street address, city, state/province, zip/postal code, country, telephone number, and the URL of your web site, although only fields that are marked with an asterisk (*) on the registration field are required. This information is used solely to assist you in navigating the system by automatically filling in certain forms (such as the ad posting form) with your information so that you don't have to continually re-enter it. Once you register you are no longer anonymous to my Adpost - you have a username and are able to take full advantage of the many offerings of the my Adpost.
In addition to registration we may ask you for personal information at other times, including (but not limited to) when you place ads or take advantage of the other features of the my Adpost. If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence. Every page within the my Adpost includes a link to this Privacy Policy.

As part of offering and providing customizable and personalized services, the my Adpost may use cookies to store and sometimes track information about you.

Several features of the my Adpost require that you accept cookies in order to work properly. (See "What choices are available to you regarding collection, use, and distribution of your information" for more information on cookies.)
Generally, we use cookies for the following purposes:
(1) To identify and label all "new" ads since your last visit to the site.
(2) Optionally to permanently save your password on your computer so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site.
(3) To enable you to "checklist" ads that you want to mark for future retrieval and viewing.
Advertising networks that serve ads onto the my Adpost may also use their own cookies.
The my Adpost may also collect IP addresses for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers.

We will provide you with the means to ensure that your personal information is correct and current. You may edit or delete your user profile at any time by clicking on the "My Login" link or graphic provided by the system once you are logged in. Once you have logged onto the system during a given session, wherever you go on the my Adpost, your information will stay with you until or unless you click on the "Logoff" link, which is accessible from within the "My Login" screen.

The kind of security precautions that are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of your information
Other than the administrator of the my Adpost or other authorized personnel of the my Adpost, you are the only person who has access to your personal information. Your user registration is password-protected to prevent unauthorized access.
We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. my Adpost will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email. As an extra security precaution, you may want to logoff once you have completed a session in the my Adpost. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe.
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, my Adpost cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.

How my Adpost protects children's privacy
my Adpost is a general audience web site. Children should always ask a parent for permission before sending personal information to anyone online. my Adpost does not share personal information about users under the age of 13 with third parties and we do not sell or rent personal information about any of our users, regardless of age. In addition, my Adpost will not send any direct email offers to users who indicate they are under the age of 13.

What else you should know about your online privacy
Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example in ads that you post or through email - that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.
Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online.
