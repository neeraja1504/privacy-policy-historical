Privacy Policy – MyRuMe.com
SECURE ORDERING
The security of the information regarding your order is very important to us. We use the 256-bit Secure Socket Layer protocol combined with credit card number encryption, to protect the security of your online order information. SSL technology encrypts your order information to protect it from being decoded by anyone other than RuMe Bags.
Once you reach the buy page your computer will begin communicating with our server in secure mode. You can tell that you are in secure mode by the following:
The "http" in the web address will be replaced by "https"
Depending on the browser, you will see either a padlock (Microsoft Internet Explorer, AOL, Netscape Communicator) or a solid key (Netscape Navigator) in the lower section for the browser window.
Only browsers that use the 256-bit Secure Socket Layer protocol are able to order through the RuMe website. If your browser does not support SSL, you can get an upgrade at Microsoft's or Netscape's home page.

Security
The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
Business Transitions
In the event RuMe, Inc. goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred. The buyer of RuMe’s assets will be obligated to use your personally identifiable information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, unless they receive consent from you to use it in a different way.  RuMe will not sell its customer information separately from a change of ownership or control of its business or a particular business unit to which the information relates.  You will be notified via email of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.

We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.
