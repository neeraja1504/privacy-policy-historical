Sharing your information
We do not, and will not, sell any of your personal data to any third party – including your name, address, email address or phone number. We want to earn and maintain your trust, and we believe this is essential in order do that.
However, we share your data with the following categories of companies as an essential part of being able to provide our services to you, as set out in this statement:
Companies that do things to get your purchases to you, such as payment service providers, warehouses, and couriers
Professional service providers, such as digital marketing agencies and website hosts, who help us run our online business
HM Revenue & Customs, regulators and other authorities based in the United Kingdom who require reporting of processing activities in certain circumstances.
If you want to send a parcel from the UK to a destination outside of the UK, you may visit and use the myHermes International website which is a website operated by our third-party partner, Parcel2go.com Limited under the myHermes brand.
This means that if you use the myHermes International website you are contracting with Parcel2go.com Limited rather with myHermes. Parcel2go.com Limited is a company registered in England. Parcel2go.com Limited may be contacted via https://international.myhermes.co.uk/help-centre
We share personal data and other data related to the Services, which myHermes has collected from you in relation to our Services, with Parcel2go.com Limited but, this is only used to:

We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.
IP Addresses
What are IP addresses?
An IP address is a string of numbers which identifies a specific computer or internet enabled device when it connects to a network such as the internet, enabling such devices to communicate.
How we use IP addresses
We record the IP address of visitors to our website and we collect related information such as the products viewed or searched for, the length of visits to certain pages and page interaction.
We use an independent company to collate the information described above. This company then provides us with data relating to website visitors that have accessed our website from businesses.
We may then use this information to provide potential business customers with details of services that we offer.
Your information and countries outside the EU
We have an offshore Customer Contact Centre in India, which we use for helping to process customer enquiries during busy periods. Similarly, to support IT Development activities we have a couple of support partners located in India. As India is not a country that currently has a European Commission decision of adequacy, we protect your privacy and your rights using the European Commission’s standard data protection clauses.
To continually review and improve the quality of service we offer our customers, we may invite you to take part in a survey provisioned by a company called ForeSee. The data collected by ForeSee will only include personal data should you choose to provide it – the survey can be completed anonymously. The data collected by ForeSee is hosted in the United States and the transfer of data is protected using the European Commission’s standard data protection clauses or under the EU recognised Privacy Shield arrangements.
Only a small percentage of visitors will be asked to undertake the survey. If you don’t want to take part, please close the pop-up window invite and you can continue with your browsing.
If you choose to take the survey:
a session cookie will be placed on your computer so that Foresee can communicate with you during the survey. This cookie will be deleted when you close your browser; and
• a persistent cookie will be placed on your computer which helps Foresee to ensure that you won’t be asked to complete the survey again within a reasonable amount of time. This cookie will be deleted at a set expiration date.
All data is submitted directly to Foresee and Foresee provides myHermes with the results of the survey. Foresee will not sell or disclose to third parties any personal data gathered from the surveys. For full details of how Foresee process and use the survey data please see:
http://www.foreseeresults.com/privacy-policy.shtml
Data Security
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
Data Retention
- How Long Will You Use My Personal Data For?
We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
By law we have to keep basic information about our customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data) for six years after they cease being customers for tax purposes.
In some circumstances, we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
Keeping your information
We’ll hold on to your information for as long as you have your account, or as long as is needed to be able to provide the services to you, or (in the case of any contact you may have with our Customer Care team) for as long as is necessary to provide support-related reporting and trend analysis only.
If reasonably necessary or required to meet legal or regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, prevent fraud and abuse, or enforce our terms and conditions, we may also keep hold of some of your information as required, even after you have closed your account or it is no longer needed to provide the services to you.
Your Legal Rights
You have a lot of rights relating to your personal information. You have the right to:
Request Access - The right to access the personal information we hold about you. This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
Request Correction - The right to request the correction of inaccurate personal information we hold about you (although you can probably do most of this through your Account)
Request Deletion - The right to request that we delete your data, or stop processing it or collecting it, in some circumstances where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
Request Transfer - The right to request that we transfer or port elements of your data either to you or another service provider. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
Object to processing where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which overrides your rights and freedoms.
Request restriction of processing - This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
Where you receive direct marketing messages from Hermes, you can withdraw your consent directly via the ‘Unsubscribe’ link in the email or via your Account Settings.
No Fee Usually Required
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
What We May Need From You
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
Time Limit to Respond
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
