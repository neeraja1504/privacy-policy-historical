The information tracked includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, MIME type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring and exit pages, platform type, date and time stamp, and number of clicks. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information, and My Digital Life does not correlate this information with data about individual users.
This information allows us to better tailor our content to readers’ needs, analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement in the aggregate, gather broad demographic information for aggregate use and to help our advertisers and sponsors better understand the demographics of our audience. Because My Digital Life derives its revenue mainly from sponsorships and advertising, providing such aggregated demographic data is essential to keeping our service free to users.
