What information does My Damn Channel collect?
For visitors to our website and registered users, we log standard technical information, such as your IP address. If you choose to register with us, My Damn Channel requires you to provide your name, email address, and each user has a user ID and password that they choose. To maintain privacy it is important not to share your password with anyone. Selecting a longer password with a mix of letters, numbers and symbols makes it more difficult for others to guess your password. It is also helpful to change passwords on a regular basis. In addition, for registered users, My Damn Channel will require you to provide geographical information such as your physical address. In the future My Damn Channel may ask you to provide other demographic information, such as age, gender, interests or occupation. We may collect other personal information when you provide feedback or comments, or communicate with others through our systems. My Damn Channel also uses "cookies" – small files containing a string of characters sent to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser – in addition to web beacons – one-pixel, GIF images used for gathering and sharing information used to administer the My Damn Channel Service website and provide a more tailored and user-friendly service to you. For example, we may use cookies or web beacons to count the number of unique computers accessing our website. You can set your browser to refuse cookies from the My Damn Channel Service if you choose. When you access the My Damn Channel Service or open one of our HTML emails, or newsletters for registered users, we may automatically record certain information from your system by using different types of tracking technology.

In addition, we look at technical information to diagnose problems with our systems, to administer the My Damn Channel Service, and to enhance the services we provide to you. We may use your information to track user-submitted content and users to the extent necessary to comply as a service provider with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If you have registered with the My Damn Channel Service, we may use your email address, without further consent, for administrative communications such as notifying you of major updates, for customer service purposes, to address copyright infringement or defamation issues, or to contact you regarding any content on the My Damn Channel Service.
