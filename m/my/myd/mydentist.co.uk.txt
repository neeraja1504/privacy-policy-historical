‘legitimate interests’ means the interest of mydentist in managing our practices and business generally so, ultimately, we can give you the best possible care. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law).
The company responsible for your information and privacy (also known as the ‘data controller’) is Whitecross Dental Care Limited.
What would you change about your smile?
If you have completed one of our ‘Smile Checker’ forms, any information you give to us in the coloured section will only be used by your dental care professional to discuss your dental needs at your practice. We do not record any of the information in that section and we will dispose of this form securely at the end of our conversation.
Collecting your personal information
We collect your personal information from you only.
This may be:
directly from you such as when:
you let us know how you want to hear from us and what you hear from us about
you complete one of our ‘Smile Checker’ forms (such as when you are visiting one of our practices) and
you complete any other similar forms on our website or in practice, or
indirectly from you, such as when you interact with our website and when we use online personalised ads. When you do this we collect and use technical data automatically about your equipment, browsing actions and patterns. We collect and use this personal data by using cookies and other similar technologies. We also receive technical data about you if you visit other websites employing our cookies (for more details, go to our Cookie policy and see ‘Seeing ads for mydentist online’ in the ‘Using your personal information’ section).

exclusive offers and discounts, and
competitions.

This means that if you visit our site, other sites such as Google will show mydentist ads on other sites across the Internet (including Google itself). Google helps us do this by using cookies or similar technologies on your computer.
You can opt out of this at any time by visiting:
Google's Ads settings, or

Failing to give us your personal information
You are always in control of your information. If you don’t want us to send you details of our products and services, we will respect your wishes. However, please bear in mind that if you don’t give us certain key personal information we won’t be able to contact you for the reasons set out in the ‘Using your personal information’ section.
Changing why we use your personal information
We won’t do this. We will only use your personal information to send you details of the products and services which you have told us you are interested in (see the ‘Collecting your personal information’ section).
Sharing your personal information
We may share your personal information with other people or businesses where:
required by law
where it is necessary for the purposes of administration (such as with other entities in the mydentist group), and
we have another legitimate interest in doing so.
If we do this, we require these third parties to respect the security of your personal information and to treat it in accordance with the law. In addition, all of our third-party service providers and other entities in the mydentist group are required to take appropriate security measures to protect your personal information in line with our policies.
We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal information for their own purposes. We only permit them to process your personal information:
for specified purposes, and
in accordance with our instructions.
We will, where necessary, share your personal information with other third parties, for example in the context of the possible sale or restructuring of the business.
We will also, where necessary, need to share your personal information with a regulator (such as the GDC or CQC) or to otherwise comply with the law.
Social media
We love social media and chatting with you there, whether it be on Facebook, Twitter, any NHS or HSC website or our ‘Big smiles blog’.
Don’t forget, however, that everybody can see everything you do there (our sites are public) so if you want us to keep your information private, please don’t put anything on these sites which you or your loved ones would like to keep private, whether now or in the future.
We will always try to respond to you using another medium such as e-mail or phone, where appropriate.
If you use certain social media features from within our website or connect with us on our social media webpages, the privacy policies of those companies will apply. Please read them carefully before you share your information with us and others as these companies may have different standards of protection of information than we do.
Securing and protecting your personal information
Your personal information deserves the greatest protection and security. This is why we have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent it from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed.
In addition, we limit access to your personal information to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal information on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality to us. Details of these measures may be obtained from our Data Protection Officer (see the ‘Data Protection Officer’ section).
We have put in place extensive procedures to deal with any suspected security breach which involves personal information and we will let you and any applicable regulator know of a suspected breach where we are legally required to do so.
Keeping your personal information for as long as necessary
We will only keep your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it.
We may also need to keep it for other purposes including for satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
Once you no longer wish to hear from us we will retain and securely destroy your personal information in accordance with our Data Retention Policy. This states that we will delete your personal information as soon as we can.
Keeping your personal information up to date
It is important that the personal information we hold about you is accurate and current.
Please keep us informed if your personal information changes by letting a member of our team know when you are in practice or by calling the practice.
Exercising your legal rights
Under certain circumstances, by law you have the right to ask for:
access to your personal information (commonly known as a ‘subject access request’). This means you can receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and check that we are processing it properly
the correction of the personal information that we hold about you. This means you can correct any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you
the erasure of your personal information. This means you can ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it
the restriction of processing of your personal information. This means you can ask us to suspend the processing of personal information about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it and
the transfer of your personal information to another party.
If you want to do any of these things please let a member of our team know when you are in practice or calling the practice.
In almost all circumstances you do not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights).
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.
