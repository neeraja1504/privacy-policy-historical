Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose personally identifiable information or personally sensitive data through Mueller Reports public message boards, this information may be collected and used by others. Note: Mueller Reports does not read any of your private online communications.
Mueller Reports encourages you to review the privacy statements of Web sites you choose to link to from Mueller Reports so that you can understand how those Web sites collect, use and share your information.

In those cases, your unique personally identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party. In addition, Mueller Reports may share data with trusted partners to help us perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to Mueller Reports, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.

Use of Cookies
The Mueller Reports Web site use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Mueller Reports pages, or register with Mueller Reports site or services, a cookie helps Mueller Reports to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Mueller Reports Web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Mueller Reports features that you customized.
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Mueller Reports services or Web sites you visit.
Security of your Personal Information
Mueller Reports secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Mueller Reports secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other Web sites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
Changes to this Statement
Mueller Reports will occasionally update this Statement of Privacy to reflect company and customer feedback. Mueller Reports encourages you to periodically review this Statement to be informed of how Mueller Reports is protecting your information.
