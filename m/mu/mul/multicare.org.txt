Server Log Information
MultiCare collects standard server log information such as IP address, time spent on the site, browser type, etc. We collect and assess this information on an aggregate basis in order to track site statistics, pages that are most popular to our visitors, performance monitoring and troubleshooting. We also use this information for site and system security. We do not share server log information with third parties for marketing or other purposes.

Any registration form that requires a visitor to provide us with contact information (i.e. name, address, phone number), unique identifiers (i.e. email address, social security number), financial information (i.e. account or credit card numbers), and other information (i.e. employment history, preferences, etc.) is covered in this privacy policy. Financial information that is collected is used only to bill the visitor for services and products utilized. Unique identifiers (i.e. social security numbers) are collected only for registration and educational class enrollment. Access to this information is password protected on our servers, and is accessible to only a minimal number of MultiCare employees for business use only. We do not share this information with outside parties.

Any connection between your web browser and an https-protected page on our site uses this level of encryption. Learn more about MyChart Security Settings.
