Personal information
Personal information refers to all private information about an identifiable individual, such as a user's name, contact details, identity number, income levels, age, personal views and preferences.
Active collection of personal information
The multichoice website actively collects personal information from users by asking users specific questions and by permitting users to communicate directly with MultiChoice, for example via e-mail, feedback forms, forums and/or chat rooms.
Some areas of this site may also require the user to submit information in order for the user to register for certain services or benefit from specified features (for example newsletter subscriptions, tips/pointers, payment processing) or to participate in a particular activity (such as competitions or other promotions, an example being the "Sign Me In" function) (collectively referred to as the "value added services").
In these situations, MultiChoice will ask the user for particular information, and inform the user at each information point what information is required and what information is optional.
Passive collection of personal information
MultiChoice passively collects (i.e. without the user actively providing the information) personal information about a user as the user accesses and navigates through the multichoice website using various technologies and means, such as navigational data collection and cookies.
A cookie is an alphanumeric identifier which MultiChoice's computer system transfers to a user's hard drive through the user's web browser when the user visits the multichoice website. It enables MultiChoice's system to recognise the user when the user visits the multichoice website again and to improve our service to the user.
This enables MultiChoice to diagnose problems with its server, report and aggregate information, determine the fastest route for a user's computer to use in connecting with the multichoice website, and better administer and improve the site. It also enables MultiChoice to compile aggregate information about users' access to and use of the multichoice website. This information can be used to enhance the content of the multichoice website and make it more user-friendly.
