MULTILOTTO will use the email address which you have provided us with to send you an email welcoming you to our site; we may from time to time send out service related emails announcing for instance a temporary suspension of one or more of our services due to maintenance.
Sharing of Data
MULTILOTTO may need to share your personal data with a number of trusted third parties due to the nature of the services it provides you with. These third parties include:
(i) Game providers – sometimes our game providers would require access to select data attributes (such as username, IP address, for instance), in order to provide us with the games you play on our website;
(ii) Payments providers – similarly, we may share some of your personal data with the payment providers you use to make and receive payments on our website;
(iii) Marketing partners - where we have your consent to send you marketing and promotions, we may share your contact details (such as email address or mailing address) with our marketing partners who take care of sending out all our marketing material to you;
(iv) Governmental or regulatory authorities - where we are legally obliged to disclose your data, we may have to share your personal data with such bodies.
We may, if necessary or authorised by law, provide your personal data to law enforcement agencies, governmental or regulatory organisations, courts or other public authorities. We attempt to notify all our customers about legal demands for their personal data unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such demands when we believe that the requests are disproportionate, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand.
We always ensure that any third party having access to your personal data is bound to respect the security of your personal data, and to process it in a lawful manner at all times and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and strict codes of conduct. We do not allow any third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes. Processing by such third parties (also known as “Data Processors”) is solely carried out for specific purposes and in accordance with our instructions as Data Controller and on our behalf, and such third parties may only use your personal data to the extent to which we ourselves are entitled. Furthermore, in all cases, we strive to ensure that we do not share more data than is necessary to be shared for the service providers to carry out the processing activities in accordance with our instructions.
MULTILOTTO shall only be responsible for its own privacy policy and it does not warrant the standard of the privacy policies of any of the third parties who may have links placed on our site; we strongly recommend that whenever you leave our site you consult the privacy policy of any new site you may be visiting. MULTILOTTO shall in no manner whatsoever be held responsible for the manner in which third parties process the personal data you yourself provide them with.
Transfers of Personal Data
Some of the service providers mentioned above may be based in countries which do not form part of the European Economic Area (“ EEA ”). This may mean that your data may be stored in a location outside of the EEA. Whenever any transfers of your personal data are made to Data Processors located outside of the EEA, we always ensure that your data is protected in the same way as it is in the EEA. In order to ensure the protection of your data, we implement at least one of the following safeguards:
(i) Adequacy decision – we ensure that we transfer your personal data to countries providing an adequate level of protection according to the European Commission;
(ii) US / Swiss Privacy Shield - where the Data Processors we use are based in the United States of America or Switzerland, we try to ensure that such Data Processors are approved under the Privacy Shield. This Privacy Shield ensures that the Data Processors provide similar protection to personal data shared between the EEA and the United States or Switzerland;
(iii) Standard clauses – where the Data Processor is not based in a country benefiting from an adequacy decision or is not part of the US/Swiss privacy shield, as explained in (i) and (ii) above, we may use specific contracts, known as standard contract clauses, which are model contracts approved by the European Commission. These contracts also ensure that the personal data is afforded the same protection as it is in the EEA.
Automated Decision Making
In establishing and carrying out our business relationship, MULTILOTTO does not generally make use of fully automated decision making. If we use this procedure in individual cases, we shall inform you of this separately.

We also have procedures in place to deal with any suspected or actual personal data breaches. We will notify both you as an affected data subject and the supervisory authority concerned of any such data breach whenever we are legally required to do so and we shall maintain a log of any such breaches.
