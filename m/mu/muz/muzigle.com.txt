As of the date of this privacy policy, Muzigle does not intentionally collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13.
We will not sell, rent or otherwise distribute your personally identifiable information to third parties without your consent, except as set forth below.

Use of encryption for sensitive personal information, such as credit card numbers and user names;
Restrict employee access to databases containing personal information and impose confidentiality requirements upon employees who do; and

WHEN AND HOW DO WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES?
Muzigle does not use your personal information for purposes incompatible with those listed above. Muzigle does not sell, rent, or share your personal information to a third party unless you consent to provide such information to a third party partner or content service.
In some cases, access to certain products and services, such as content subscription products or products distributed by third parties, may require the provision of personal information to a third party, such as a content provider or distributor. In such cases, this will be stated during the registration process, in the terms of use, through the distribution process, or in a similar manner. The third party's use of such information is governed by that party's privacy policy, and Muzigle' use is governed by this privacy policy. Please visit the privacy policy of the content partner to make sure you understand how they use the personal information you provide to them. If you do not wish for such a transfer to take place, you should not register for the applicable product or service. Additionally, Muzigle may be required to provide specific access and usage information to certain content providers and rights holders as a condition of content licensing and royalties. In such cases, Muzigle may provide content usage, access, demographic and other information without your personally identifiable information (your name, billing information, email address) to the content provider.
Muzigle may disclose relevant information about our customers to our contractors (e.g. a customer service contractor or a credit card clearing service) in order for them to provide specific services for Muzigle, and to better serve our customers. Muzigle' contractors are bound by strict contractual requirements to keep all personal information they process strictly confidential and to use such information solely on behalf of Muzigle.
Also, Muzigle may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law; (b) comply with the order of a competent judicial authority in any jurisdiction; (c) comply with legal process served on Muzigle; (d) protect and defend the rights or property of Muzigle; or (e) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Muzigle products or the public at large.
Muzigle websites, products and services contain links to other websites, and products and services. Because Muzigle does not manage such third party websites, products and services, they are not governed by this privacy policy. Muzigle is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Websites or products. Please visit the privacy policies of these third party sites in order to understand their privacy policies and data collection practices.
Obligatory or Optional Nature of the Requested Information
Some of the personal information collected by Muzigle is necessary to provide you with the Muzigle product or service you choose and to optimize the delivery of audio and video data to your computer. Muzigle software may include the opportunity to disable certain software features to increase your level of privacy. However, certain technical information (e.g. zip code, product id, GUID) may be automatically transmitted between networked servers to authenticate access to products and services, enable their delivery, or optimize your media delivery experience.
E-MAIL FROM MUZIGLE
Registering for a product or service allows you to tell us how or whether you want Muzigle to communicate with you. Generally, we send e-mail to you about our products, content and special offers. Separate Muzigle products, services and lines of business may send separate news letters and marketing emails. During registration, you may opt out of receiving Muzigle marketing e-mails and/or newsletters for the relevant product or service. Additionally, your online Muzigle account, accessed through the "My Account" link on www.muzigle.com, and through other links provided in emails and on Muzigle Web pages, enables you to select whether you wish to receive newsletters, marketing and promotional emails, special offers and the like from various Muzigle's business lines. However, we may continue to send you e-mail about products or services you have previously purchased (such as an available upgrade that you are entitled to receive), your account status or other information concerning functions, features and status of your Muzigle products and services, or to inform you about critical technical service issues relating to a Muzigle product or service.
HOW TO ACCESS AND UPDATE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
To access your account information and preferences, select "Manage My Account" from the menu on www.muzigle.com. Sign in to your account and modify your information and preferences as needed.
When you access your account by logging in, you can update and/or make sure that your account information is accurate. You can also manage your preferences concerning receipt of newsletters and promotional emails. If you have forgotten a username or password, you can use our online help.

CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY
We frequently revise this Privacy Policy to keep it up to date with Muzigle products, services and Web pages. "Updated" may be used to alert users to recent changes and to the date of the last update. We also post FAQ's from time to time on specific products.
NON-US CUSTOMER INFORMATION
If you are a customer who is logging on from outside the United States, the personal information you submit to Muzigle will be sent to and stored in servers in U.S. The personal information practices set out in this Privacy Policy apply to all Muzigle's customers worldwide.
If you are in the European Union and you choose to purchase Muzigle's products and services, please be aware that payment for such products and services will be handled by Muzigle, Inc.

You have a right of access and rectification with regard to such data; to exercise these rights, or for other data privacy questions, please contact/send an email to privacy@muzigle.com.
NO ERROR FREE PERFORMANCE
We customarily release alpha and beta versions of our products, which are further refined before the release of the final "Gold" version. Because these products are still in a test phase, we may not always catch an unintended privacy issue, despite our efforts to do so. As such, we welcome feedback on any privacy concerns you may have, and on how to improve our products generally, in all stages of release. Muzigle does not guarantee error-free performance under this privacy policy. We will use reasonable efforts to comply with this privacy policy and will take prompt corrective action when we learn of any failure to comply with our privacy policy. Muzigle shall not be liable for any incidental, consequential or punitive damages relating to this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy shall be governed by the laws of the United States.
