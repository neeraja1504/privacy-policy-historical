Privacy Policy
Muziic stores information that we collect through cookies, log files, and clear gifs to create a "profile" of your preferences. This statistical information may be used to help Muziic provide tailored services and to improve the content of the site for you.
Giving us your personal data on this site is completely optional and will require you to setup an account with a password and an email address. You may also submit additional personal information (including data on your profile and on message boards). Please remember that any information you submit becomes public information that can be viewed by others.
The Publish Playback feature allows users who are logged into their Muziic accounts to share playlist data information from the Muziic Player. By default, the Publish Playback feature is enabled for users who have logged into the Muziic Player. Users may opt out of this feature by disabling Publish Playback in the Muziic Player settings menu. With Muziic Web Player, Publish Playback is always on, however, users may logout to avoid attributing plays to their account.
