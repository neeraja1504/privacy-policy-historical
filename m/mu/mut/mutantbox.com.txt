When you install any of the Mutantbox games or applications, we may collect and record the information you provide us voluntarily through the social networking website in accordance with their policies and terms.

ii. User identification number;
iii. Email address;
iv. Home address;
v. Phone number.
vi. Instant message account
Non-personal information is information that is not, on its own, personal information, such as your IP address, but that may be considered part of an individual's personal information if combined with other identifiers in a way that enables identification of an individual.
Additionally, we may acquire information from you through:
i.Your access and participation in message boards on the Service;

7. Cookies and Other Information on a User's Machine
Mutantbox’s products, services and sites may employ cookies and other technologies such as web beacons and pixel tags. Cookies are bits of electronic information that can be transferred to a user's hard drive to customize a person's use of a product or online site, keep records of a user's access to an online site or product, or store information needed by the user on a regular basis. Use of cookies is typically associated with websites. For example, when you sign in to Mutantbox online websites , we stores your user id and a combination of your IP address and time of login as a cookie on your hard drive. This cookie allows you to move from page to page without having to sign in again on each page. Similarly, if you enter information during your session, such as age verification data, this will be stored as a cookie and you will not have to re-enter such information during that session. We may also use third party web site analytic tools that employ cookies to collect certain non-personally identifiable information concerning use of our websites, such as referring web site addresses, page views and browser types.
However, users can disable cookies by changing their browser settings. Mutantbox also stores on a user’s hard drive a unique authorization key or CD-Key that is either entered by the user or downloaded automatically during product registration. This authorization key is used to identify a user as valid and allow access to Mutantbox's products, services and third party games. This key is necessary for Mutantbox to supply any products and services subscribed by users.
Information regarding Mutantbox billing, a user’s Mutantbox account, a user's Internet connection and the Mutantbox software installed on a user's computer is uploaded to the server in connection with the user's use of Steam and Mutantbox software. Mutantbox software automatically generates and submits to Mutantbox bug reports upon a crash or other fault in the Mutantbox software, services or Steam games. This automatically generated bug report information may include information about other software or hardware on a user's system. Mutantbox does not associate and store the automatically generated bug report information with users’ personally identifiable information. Any bug reporting information manually submitted by users (e.g. through Mutantbox's Bug Reporter form) is associated and stored with personally identifiable information sent voluntarily by the user through a bug report.
