MusoCity.com - Privacy Policy
MusoCity.com is a promotion and networking service that allows members to create unique personal profiles online in order to promote their music or business and communicate with other MusoCity.com members. To enrich our members' experience, we request and display some personal information to other members and visitors, which allows our users to identify each other. MusoCity.com members can change their profile information at any time and can control how other members and the service communicates with them.
MusoCity.com collects user submitted information such as name, email address, and date of birth to authenticate users and to send notifications to those users relating to the MusoCity.com service. MusoCity.com also collects other profile data including but not limited to: gender, geographical location and musical taste in order to assist users in finding and communicating with each other.
MusoCity.com also logs non-personally-identifiable information including IP address, profile information, aggregate user data, and browser type, from users and visitors to the site. This data is used to manage the website, track usage and improve the website services. This non-personally-identifiable information may be shared with third-parties to provide more relevant services and advertisements to members. User IP addresses are recorded for security and monitoring purposes
User Profile information including members' pictures, userid, display name and geographic location are displayed to people in order to facilitate user interaction in the MusoCity.com networking community. Email addresses are used for the purposes of inviting friends or associates to join Musocity and to send notifications related to the service. With the exception of inviting friends and notifications, a user's email address is not shared or displayed on the website. Users of MusoCity.com communicate with each other through the MusoCity.com service, without disclosing their email addresses. For all accounts, users can select the 'display name' and userid which identify them on the website and do not need to reveal their name to other users of the site.
We may also use a user's email address to send updates, a newsletter or news regarding the service. Users may choose not to receive email of this type by changing their "email notifications" settings on the "Message Settings" screen.
Musocity members can invite friends or other associates to join the service by sending invitation emails via our automated invitation system. MusoCity.com allows the individuals receiving these invitations to opt out of receiving further invitations or other email correspondence. To enable us to identify the email addresses of individuals who have previously opted not to receive invitations to join the site, MusoCity.com stores the email addresses that members provide on the email invitation screen. MusoCity.com does not sell these email addresses or use them to send any other communication besides invitations. Recipients of invitations from MusoCity.com may contact MusoCity.com to request the removal of their information from our database.
