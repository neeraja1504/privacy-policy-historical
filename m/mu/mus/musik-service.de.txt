Privacy Policy – Thomann United States
This Privacy Policy describes how Thomann GmbH (hereinafter referred to as “Musikhaus Thomann”) processes and protects according to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the relevant German data protection laws, in particular the German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG), the data you provide us with when using our website.
The security of personal data such as name, address, telephone number or email, is a serious and important concern for our company. Therefore, we conduct our online activities in compliance with the respective statutory provisions relating to data protection and data security. Below, you can find the information we process.
Personal data / types of use
As a principle, the protection of your personal data is of highest priority for Musikhaus Thomann. You decide whether or not you wish to make such data known to us, for example in the course of any registration, survey or the like. Such information on your part is relevant for your enquiry, but you provide it on a voluntary basis. An exception to this rule is when prior consent cannot be obtained for practical reasons and the processing of data is permitted by law.
Legal basis for the processing of personal data
If we obtain the consent of the data subject to process their personal data, Article 6(1)(a) GDPR serves as the legal basis for the processing of personal data.
When processing personal data necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, Article 6(1)(b) GDPR shall serve as the legal basis. This also applies to any processing required to perform pre-contractual measures.
If processing of personal data is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which Musikhaus Thomann is subject, Article 6(1)(c) GDPR shall serve as the legal basis.
In the event that the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person necessitate the processing of personal data, Article 6 (1)(d) GDPR shall serve as the legal basis.
If processing is necessary to safeguard the legitimate interests of our company or of a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject, Article 6(1)(f) GDPR shall serve as the legal basis for processing.
Data deletion and storage duration
The data subject’s personal data will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose of storage ceases to apply. Data may be stored beyond this if provisions have been made for this by the European or national legislator in Union regulations, laws or other rules to which the controller is subject. Data will also be blocked or deleted if a storage period prescribed by the standards mentioned above expires, unless there is a need for further storage of the data for the conclusion or fulfilment of a contract.
Exchange of data / contractual relationships with partners / third parties
In addition to the types of use described above, Musikhaus Thomann will transfer your data to third parties that are involved in the processing of your order or that participate in contracts. For example, if you place an order via our website, we will transmit your order information to Musikhaus Thomann’s partner companies and contractors who process and deliver your order to you. Data will only be transmitted to the extent required in order to fulfil or deliver your order or to process an enquiry. We will also transmit personal data to third parties where we are required to do so by law.

The data will be deleted as soon as it is no longer necessary for the purpose of its collection. If data is stored in log files, this is the case after no more than seven days. Further storage is possible. In this case, the users’ IP addresses are deleted or distorted, so that it is no longer possible to associate them with the calling client.

Use of services for marketing and analysis purposes
Google Analytics
The Musikhaus Thomann website utilises Google Analytics, a web analytics tool by Google Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses “cookies”, text files stored on your computer that enable analysis of how you use the website. The cookie-generated information about your use of this website is usually transmitted to and stored on a Google server in the United States. However, if you are in a country that is a member state of the European Union or a contracting party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area, and if IP address anonymization has been activated on this website, Google will first truncate your IP address. Only by way of exception will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the United States and shortened there. Google will use such information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity and to provide other services to Musikhaus Thomann in relation to website use and internet use. Google will not combine the IP address transmitted by your browser via Google Analytics with other Google data. You can disable cookies by setting your browser accordingly; however, if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website. Furthermore, you can prevent collection and transfer of the data generated by cookies on www.thomann.de and relating to your use of the website (including your IP address) to Google, as well as the processing of such data by Google, by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available under the following link: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/eula.html?hl=de.
As an alternative to installing the browser plug-in, particularly in internet browsers on mobile devices, you can prevent the collection of data by Google Analytics by clicking this link: Deactivate Google Analytics.
This will save an “opt-out” cookie to your device, meaning that none of your data will be collected on this website by Google Analytics.
Please note that if you delete cookies in your browser settings, this may mean the Google Analytics opt-out cookie is also deleted and may have to be re-activated by you.
More detailed information about the function of Google Analytics and the terms of use and privacy policy relevant to this service can be found under http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/gb.html and http://www.google.de/intl/en/policies/privacy/. We would also like to point out that our website uses Google Analytics with the anonymizeIP extension so that IP addresses are only processed further in an abbreviated form to prevent them being directly linked to a particular individual.
Embedding and use of links to social media (Facebook, Google+, et al.)
Links to external social network services such as Facebook, Google+, YouTube and Twitter are embedded on our website, in particular in the areas displaying our products. The responsibility for the internet services of these social network services lies solely with their operators. Below you will find further information, categorised according to the corresponding social network service.
None of your data is transferred to social media services as a result of our links to these services. These are normal hyperlinks, through which no regular data transmission takes place. If you click on the link, you will be taken directly to our social media page on the respective social media service. Data is only transmitted if you are logged into your user account of the corresponding social media service. You can then link to or share content from our websites directly using the social media service, or you can watch YouTube videos on our YouTube channel. Under certain circumstances, the social media service may thus ascertain which content you have viewed on our website.
The responsibility for the social media services linked to by Musikhaus Thomann lies exclusively with:
Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA, for Facebook and its website;

Facebook remarketing
On our websites, we use the “Vanilla Custom Audiences Pixel”, a service provided by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA (“Facebook”). With the help of this service we can reach our customers directly through the Facebook network by showing “Facebook ads” to visitors of our website when they visit the social network Facebook.
To this end we have implemented the Facebook “remarketing pixel”. This involves code snippets which are able to identify your browser via the browser ID – your browser’s individual fingerprint – and detect that you visited our website and what exactly you viewed there. A direct connection to the Facebook servers is made when you visit our website. Facebook is able to identify you using your browser-ID, as this is linked to other data saved to your Facebook user account. Facebook then shows customised advertisements that are matched to your needs on your Facebook timeline or in another place on Facebook.
We at Thomann are not able to personally identify you via the Facebook pixel, because we do not save any personal data other than your browser ID using the Facebook remarketing pixel.
More information about Facebook custom audiences, the particulars of data processing using this service and Facebook’s data policy can be found at https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/.
You can deactivate the use of Facebook remarketing by clicking this link.
All services are used for advertising and marketing purposes with the aim of making Musikhaus Thomann’s offering more attractive. As described above for each of the individual services, we take your right to privacy seriously by allowing you to object to the use of all services and informing you in advance about this Privacy Notice. The legal basis for the aforementioned data processing is Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. The information in this Privacy Notice and the right of objection granted to you sufficiently protects your right to privacy.
Security
Musikhaus Thomann takes precautions to ensure the security of your personal data. Your data will be diligently protected against loss, destruction, manipulation and unauthorized access or unauthorized disclosure and transmission.
Musikhaus Thomann protects collected customer data by saving it on servers protected by passwords and “firewalls” that use encryption technologies to prevent unauthorised access.
Musikhaus Thomann does its utmost and implements state-of-the-art technology to provide you with a secure environment for the completion of your order; however, we cannot guarantee absolute security of your data.
We ask you to take every available precaution to protect your personal data when online. We encourage you to at least change your passwords on a regular basis, to use a combination of letters and numbers, and to ensure you use a secure browser when surfing the internet.
Classified ads
You can place classified ads on our website free of charge. To this end, we collect your name, address and email address in a registration form. These details will then be saved in our system and used for creating the classified ad. Either your name or a pseudonym, as well as your country, city, postal code and email address will be published in the classified ad. In addition, information regarding the description of the equipment, pictures uploaded by you and your telephone number (optional) will be part of the published classified ad.
The legal basis for the data processing is Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.
This is to enable interested parties to contact you, and to prevent fraud. Additionally, we compare the data provided by you for the placement of the classified ad with our customer database. This is to correct any false customer data, and to assign the classified ad to a customer account (if you are already a customer of Musikhaus Thomann), which allows you to comfortably administrate your classified ad via the regular Customer Centre log-in.
The data will be deleted as soon as it is no longer necessary for the purpose of its collection. This is the case for data collected during the registration process if the registration for our website is cancelled or modified.
As a user, you have the option to cancel your registration at any time. The data stored about you can be modified at any time via customer support. You must make a request to us for your customer account to be deleted. To do this, contact our customer support (for example, using the contact details of your personal contacts shown on the left in your customer account). Your personal data will only be blocked before deletion in individual cases if deletion prevents legal retention requirements or official orders.
