MusicStack adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability.
MusicStack is subject to the investigatory and enforcement jurisdiction of the United States Federal Trade Commission in complying with its commitments under the Privacy Shield Principles. We hereby affirm our commitment to subject to the Privacy Shield Principles all personal data transferred from the European Union and Switzerland in reliance on Privacy Shield.

DATA CONTROLLER
EU data protection law makes a distinction between organizations that process personal data for their own purposes (known as "controllers") and organizations that process personal data on behalf of other organizations (known as "processors").
MusicStack, located at the address set forth below, generally operates as a processor on behalf of its customers that use the MusicStack's services. The MusicStack customer, the controller, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data, such as orders that come to them through our Services. MusicStack's customer decides what personal data to share on our Services. Please visit the applicable customer's privacy policy for information about their privacy practices.
MusicStack also operates as a controller with respect to certain of its services. For example, MusicStack operates as a controller in connection with personal data collected from visitors through its website. Also, when MusicStack combines personal data from different customers, like many kinds of analytics services or orders of customers, it may do this both as a processor at its customers' instruction and as a controller itself for the purpose of providing services to all of its customers. For example, MusicStack may process and aggregate some of the personal data that a customer shares with MusicStack in order to make that personal data part of another database for one or more other services provided to MusicStack customers.
If you are a data subject located in Europe and want to learn more about how to exercise your rights, please see the section above entitled "European Privacy Rights".
