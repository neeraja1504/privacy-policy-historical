The information we receive depends upon what you do while visiting our site.
Our site automatically captures IP addresses and Cookie ID's (set by this site) when you visit the site while reading or downloading any information. We also collect the information on what pages visitors' access, view and request, information on referral logs, and information volunteered by the visitor, such as personal, survey, and/or application data. The information we collect is used to improve the content of our Web pages, customize the content and/or layout of our pages for each individual consumer, improve our service, notify consumers about updates to our Web site and contact them for marketing or informational purposes.
If you send an e-mail to our site, you also may decide to send us personally-identifying information. For example, you might include your name, address and phone number in an electronic mail message containing a complaint. We use personally-identifying information from consumers in various ways to further our consumer protection and competition activities. The information you provide may be seen by various company employees, company representatives, and/or law enforcement agencies. For example, we may enter the information you send into our electronic database to share with our attorneys and investigators involved in law enforcement or public policy development. We may also share it with a wide variety of other government agencies enforcing consumer protection, competition, and other laws. You may be contacted by the FTC or any of these other agencies. In other limited circumstances, including requests from Congress or private individuals, we may be required by law to disclose information you submit.
Also, e-mail is not necessarily secure against interception. If your communication is very sensitive, or includes personal information like your bank account, charge card, or social security number, you might want to send it by postal (air) mail instead.
From time to time we will ask you for your e-mail and/or postal address so we can contact you. If you provide your e-mail and/or postal address online, you will receive the information to the provided address. If you do not want to receive postal and/or e-mail from us in the future, please let us know by sending e-mail to the address below. We will make sure your name is removed from the list. If you supply us with your telephone number online, you will only receive telephone contact from us regarding applications you have submitted online. Please, provide us with your correct phone number.
Any information submitted to Music Web Town Community will be held as confidential notwithstanding the circumstances discussed above. Information collected by Music Web Town Community will not be sold or disseminated in any way to outside parties other than by court order.

If a member wishes to be removed from our community database, he or she can contact our webmaster to remove them. Please note that some records may still exist in our transaction or accounting logs.
