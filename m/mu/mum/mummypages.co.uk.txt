However, in certain circumstances, these rights may be restricted (Article 23 of the General Data Protection Regulation, which is transposed into Irish law by section 54 of the Data Protection Act 2018, sets out the circumstances in which your rights may be restricted).  In particular, your rights may be restricted where this is necessary: (i) for the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of criminal offences, and/or (ii) in contemplation of or for the establishment, exercise or defence of a legal claim or legal proceedings (whether before a court, tribunal, statutory body or an administrative or out-of-court procedure).
13.2 Subject to the above, your rights under Data Protection Legislation may include (as relevant):
Your Right: Right of Access
• What does it mean? Subject to certain conditions, you are entitled to have access to your personal data which we hold (this is more commonly known as submitting a “data subject access request”).
• How do I execute this right? Requests for such information should be made in writing to to Data Protection Officer by email data.protection@sheologydigital.com and/or by post to Sheology Data Controller, Sheology, 51 Bracken Road, Sandyford, Dublin 18, Ireland. If possible, you should specify the type of information you would like to see to ensure that our disclosure is meeting your expectations.
• Conditions to exercise? We must be able to verify your identity. Your request may not affect the rights and freedoms of others, e.g. privacy and confidentiality rights of other individuals and/or businesses.
Your Right: Right of Data Portability
• What does it mean? Subject to certain conditions, you are entitled to receive the data which you have provided to us and which is processed by us by automated means, in a commonly-used machine readable format.

Requests for such information should be made in writing to to Data Protection Officer by email data.protection@sheologydigital.com and/or by post to Sheology Data Controller, Sheology, 51 Bracken Road, Sandyford, Dublin 18, Ireland.  If possible, you should specify the type of information you would like to see to ensure that our disclosure is meeting your expectations.
• Conditions to exercise? The GDPR does not establish a general right to data portability. This right only applies if the processing is based on your consent or on our contract with you and when the processing is carried out by automated means (e.g. not for paper records). It affects only personal data that was “provided” by you. Therefore, it does not, as a rule, apply to personal data that was created by the Sheology or supplied to the Sheology by any other individual and/or business.
Your Right: Rights in relation to inaccurate personal or incomplete data
• What does it mean? You may challenge the accuracy or completeness of personal data which we process about you. If it is found that personal data is inaccurate, you are entitled to have the inaccurate data removed, corrected or completed, as appropriate.
• How do I execute this right? We encourage you to notify us of any changes regarding your personal data as soon as they occur, including changes to your contact details. Please always check first whether self-help tools are available. Requests for such information should be made in writing to to Data Protection Officer by email data.protection@sheologydigital.com and/or by post to Sheology Data Controller, Sheology, 51 Bracken Road, Sandyford, Dublin 18, Ireland.
• Conditions to exercise? This right only applies to your own personal data. When exercising this right, please be as specific as possible.
Your Right: Right to object to or restrict our data processing

• How do I execute this right? Requests for such information should be made in writing to to Data Protection Officer by data.protection@sheologydigital.com and/or by post to Sheology Data Controller, Sheology, 51 Bracken Road, Sandyford, Dublin 18, Ireland.
• Conditions to exercise? This right applies only if the processing of your personal data is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest (see “basis of processing” above). Objections must be based on grounds relating to your particular situation. They must not be generic so that we can demonstrate that there are still lawful grounds for us to process your personal data.
Your Right: Right to have personal data erased
• What does it mean? Subject to certain conditions, you are entitled, on certain grounds, to have your personal data erased (also known as the “right to be forgotten”), e.g. where you think that the information we are processing is inaccurate, or the processing is unlawful.
• How do I execute this right? Requests for such information should be made in writing to to Data Protection Officer by email data.protection@sheologydigital.com and/or by post to Sheology Data Controller, Sheology, 51 Bracken Road, Sandyford, Dublin 18, Ireland.
• Conditions to exercise? There are various lawful reasons why we may not be in a position to erase your personal data. This may apply (i) where we have to comply with a legal obligation, (ii) in case of bringing legal proceedings or defending legal proceedings, or (iii) where retention periods apply by law or under the Sheology’s internal data retention policies.
Your Right: Right to withdrawal
• What does it mean? You have the right to withdraw your consent to any processing for which you have previously given that consent.
• How do I execute this right? Requests for such information should be made in writing to to Data Protection Officer by email data.protection@sheologydigital.com and/or by post to Sheology Data Controller, Sheology, 51 Bracken Road, Sandyford, Dublin 18, Ireland.

We may also embed external content and features from such third parties within our Site (e.g. social media networks such as LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter). We do not control the content or links that appear on these sites and are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from our Site. In addition, these sites or services, including their content and links, may be constantly changing. These sites and services may have their own privacy statements and customer service policies. Browsing and interaction on any other website, including websites which have a link to our Site, is subject to that website’s own terms and policies.
CHANGES TO OUR COOKIE POLICY
We can change this Cookie Policy at any time. If we make material changes to this Cookie Policy, we will let you know either by posting the changed Cookie Policy on the Site or by sending you an email.

It also allows us to associate any comments you post with your username. While you are signed into this Site, we combine information from your registration cookies with analytics cookies, which we could use to identify which pages you have seen on our Site.
This website currently includes the use of the following first party cookies:
PHPSESSID – this identifies a user's session and allows them to provide relevant content through browsing experience. Also, it is required for login. Disabling it will prevent some functions from working properly, and login will not work.
remember_me – this remembers if a user has requested automatic login next time they visit the website. Disabling it will make automatic login impossible.
attention-closed, digest_closed and others - required to remember closed dialogs, like newsletter subscription, etc. Disabling them will make dialogs appear again.

BEHAVIOURAL ADVERTISING COOKIES
These cookies may be set through our site and other sites you visit around the web by third-party advertisers.
