Online Quotes
The 3-month online offer is only open to a personal lines policyholder who initiates and completes a quote online.  (No call centre agent interaction in terms of capturing any information).
The short-term insurance policy with MiWay is taken up online.
The first three consecutive months’ full premium must be successful.  This excludes pro-rata premiums. If any one of the first 3 months’ premium is reversed, the policyholder will not qualify for the reward.
The policyholder will be paid the average of the first three months’ consecutive premiums, into the same bank account as on the client’s policy and on the same date that the 4th premium is scheduled to be collected.
MiWay reserves the right to cancel the 3-month online offer or to change the Terms and Conditions at any time at its discretion without prior notice.
