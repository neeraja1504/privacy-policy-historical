OUR PRIVACY POLICY AND TERMS OF SERVICE MAY CHANGE ACCORDING TO THE TERMS DESCRIBED BELOW AND ALL CHANGES ARE EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY. PLEASE READ THE ENTIRE STATEMENT BEFORE USING THIS WEBSITE OR PROVIDING ANY INFORMATION THROUGH ANY OF THE SITES LISTED BELOW.
This page describes the ways in which Michigan Virtual™ , a Michigan nonprofit corporation, and all of its divisions (collectively referred to here as “ Michigan Virtual ,” “we,” “us” or “our”) handle information it obtains about individuals through the websites it operates, including:
michiganvirtual.org (and all sub-domains of michiganvirtual.org)
mivu.org (and all sub-domains of mivu.org)
mivhs.org
mvlri.org
micourses.org
We provide a variety of information, features, and functions (the “Services”) through these websites.
This page does not necessarily reflect the ways in which we collect and use information by means other than these websites. If you have questions about the ways in which we collect information by other means, please contact us using the contact information in this statement. The practices relating to persons with separate agreements with Michigan Virtual or its affiliates are separately covered in those agreements.
Information Michigan Virtual collects
The information we collect will depend on what you do when visiting our sites. EXCEPT AS STATED IN THIS STATEMENT, WE WILL NOT COLLECT PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ABOUT YOU WHEN YOU VISIT OUR SITES UNLESS YOU CHOOSE TO PROVIDE SUCH INFORMATION TO US. You are free to visit our sites without providing personally identifiable information. However, if you would like to access our Services, in some cases you must first register or create an account or learning profile with Michigan Virtual. When you register or create an account or learning profile, we will request certain personal information. Requests can include but are not limited to your name, address, city, state, zip code, county, email address, age, home or other contact information, school contact information, gender, and parent/guardian contact information. In some cases, the sponsoring party funding your participation in the course (a “Sponsoring Party”) may provide this or other information about you to us. We may use this information to create an account or learning profile and issue you an access ID and password. If you are paying with a credit card, we also will collect your credit card number (employing industry standard security and encryption technologies), billing information and email address to process your payment.
Personal information better enables us to provide you with content relevant to your interests and provides us with aggregate demographic data that Michigan Virtual uses to improve the services offered to users. Users may change their personal information at any time by using the provided interface once they are logged in and as often as necessary. If users are unable to log in and change their information themselves, they will be able to send an email to customercare@michiganvirtual.org or contact us at the telephone number or address below for assistance.
In addition to registration, Michigan Virtual may, from time to time, request personal information for purposes such as the provision of customer service, billing, network management, customer surveys, newsletter subscriptions, offers of related services, and other exchanges of information. Users may opt out of receiving future promotional mailings at any time. Please see below for User Options – Opt Out.
Michigan Virtual gathers information about all users collectively, such as what areas users visit most frequently and what services users’ access most often. Michigan Virtual automatically logs IP addresses, session sources, and other data which tracks users’ access to our sites. We analyze these logs for sales and marketing purposes as well as system performance monitoring. These logs are analyzed for the overall, aggregate trends they reveal about our customers, not for the behaviors of individual users.
Privacy of children
The Michigan Virtual policy is to limit the collection of personal information from children in substantial agreement with the Children’s Online Privacy and Protection Act (COPPA). Children ages 12 and under will not knowingly be allowed to register with Michigan Virtual or create an account without their parent’s permission. Before children ages 12 and under may participate in any Services requiring registration (e.g., creating or enrolling in a course, chat rooms, message boards or other forums), the child’s school must first obtain the parent’s permission and that permission may allow us to collect and maintain the child’s information. If at any time after a parent gives permission, the parent desires to review the child’s personal information, request that it be deleted, or refuse to allow any further collection of the child’s information, the parent may contact the school’s representative for Michigan Virtual  with such a request. If you have additional questions regarding your child’s use of his or her account, you may contact the school’s representative or Michigan Virtual. Please see below for our contact information.
Michigan Virtual abides by COPPA and the regulations under it. You can obtain more information about COPPA from the Federal Trade Commission.
What does Michigan Virtual do with the information it collects?
The User ID you select during registration must be used to log in and participate in a Service or course. Once you log into our Blackboard site, you may be identified to the instructor and other students in that course by your full name in areas such as discussion forums, email lists, web conferences, and other places where participant names appear. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes available to the instructor and other students in that course. Blackboard has a user accessible directory feature. Anyone with a Blackboard account can choose to share their Blackboard profile information in this directory. You can turn on or off this feature once logged into Blackboard. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.
Michigan Virtual hosts, or provides links to, chat rooms, forums and message boards. Our online instructors, instructor services, and student services staff monitor and respond to user email sent to them and monitor and participate with users in threaded discussions and other online forums. Michigan Virtual may monitor or edit the contents of a user’s email or threaded discussions or other online forums as required for normal maintenance of any of our websites or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to:
Comply with the law or comply with legal process served on Michigan Virtual .

In accordance with Michigan’s State School Aid Act, Michigan Virtual offers student courses as part of its effort to serve as a statewide laboratory and quality model of instruction for implementing virtual learning solutions. As such, it is possible that research will be conducted on a course in which students are enrolled or on students’ online experience. Non-personally identifiable data will be shared with researchers for these purposes. If for any reason a student does not want to participate in research activities or does not want his or her data to be used for research purposes, please send an email at any time to customercare@michiganvirtual.org. In that email, please include the student’s first and last name, the email address the student uses when signing into the Student Learning Portal, as well as a sentence indicating that the student does not want to participate in research activities. Please use “Research” in the subject line of the email. A student’s participation in research is voluntary and there is no penalty if a student does not want to participate.
Michigan Virtual will abide by the student privacy guidelines set forth by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). The following persons have access to student records:

Cookies
A cookie is a small data file that certain websites write to your computer when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you’ve visited. A cookie can’t read data from your hard disk or generally read cookie files created by other sites. Michigan Virtual uses cookies to track information about visitors to our sites, such as the pages they visit and product information they view. We may do this through the use of cookies, flash cookies or pixel tags. The information we collect helps us better manage the sites, provides ease of use of the sites for the user, and provides more effective marketing to the user.
Our Blackboard course management system uses cookies as a unique user and session identifier. These cookies are not “persistent,” which is to say that they are not permanently stored on the user’s computer. The Blackboard cookie is destroyed when the browser session is closed.

Use the “help” feature of your browser to obtain more information about cookies.

Michigan Virtual websites are designed to provide you with the information and services you expect: web pages that are accessible, easy-to-use, error-free and provide appropriate security. To achieve this goal, we’ve developed our site in accordance with widely accepted web standards.
If our pages do not function correctly or appear broken, you may have JavaScript turned off, or you may be using a web browser that is not compatible with the security or development standards of this site. Most Michigan Virtual websites and web applications use JavaScript and require that you allow JavaScript in your web browser in order for them to function correctly.
Log files
We or our hosting provider may collect traffic information from visitors for statistical analysis and site improvement.
