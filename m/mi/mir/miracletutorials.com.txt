Unless you give us your explicit approval we will only share your personal information, including with Miracle Tutorials affiliates (being other companies controlled by or under common control with us) where there is a legal obligation to do so, namely:

3. What personal data we collect and why we collect it
Newsletter
For our newsletter system, we use a professional service that encrypts transmissions to limit access to the system that stores your personal information when you subscribe to our newsletter. This service is verified by the EU-U.S. PRIVACY SHIELD FRAMEWORK.
You are not obliged to use your real name when you subscribe and we actually encourage you to use a non existing name but the e-mail address must be real otherwise, you won’t receive the newsletter.
All subscribers are asked to verify their subscription via e-mail. Only after you verified, you can receive the newsletter.
Important: The newsletter only shows link(s) to the latest article(s) and its frequency is irregular. We only write if we have something worthwhile to say, which means that there will be long and short gaps between newsletter editions.
Comments
When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.
An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here: https://automattic.com/privacy/. After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.
You are not obliged to use your real name when comment and we actually encourage you to use a non existing name.
4. Unsubscribing from the newsletter
You can request to be removed from the newsletter database at any time at the bottom of the newsletter. This will take immediate effect. If for some reason you are unable to do so, you can contact us here to have you unsubscribed manually.
5. How long we retain your data
If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.
6. What rights you have over your data
Comments
If you have left comments , you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. We use a double opt-in procedure to make sure nobody else tries to impersonate you. We expect you to use the same e-mail address we have on record. We usually respond within 48 hours, except in weekends or official holidays.
Newsletter
If you subscribed to the newsletter, you can request to receive proof that you are subscribed and what the newsletter system holds about you. We use a double opt-in procedure to make sure nobody else tries to impersonate you. We expect you to use the same e-mail address we have on record.
Erasing personal data
You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes. For example, when you are blocked from the website for security reasons, we won’t give you information on that subject to protect our system.
7. Where we send your data
Visitor comments are checked through an automated spam detection service.
8. How we protect your data
We have a firewall which blocks illegal intrusions and we regularly update the website software. However, nothing is 100% secure on the Internet, therefore we cannot guarantee total safety at all times.
