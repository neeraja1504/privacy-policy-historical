What information do we collect?
We do not collect PII without your prior consent and this information is only ever used in the way that you instruct us to use it.
Mirago do not monitor, store or attempt to identify the name, e-mail address, home or office address of any person as a result of submitting a search query. In this respect a search is entirely anonymous. Because of this, we automatically comply with the rules set out in the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).
Mirago collects non-identifying information when you visit any of our sites either directly or via the Mirago Searchbar. This information is stored in a log file and includes IP address, browser type, the date and time of your visit, the date and time of your query and one or more cookies. This information is only ever used to improve your service, develop new functionality and ensure that our services operate correctly.
Mirago advertising services require user registration. This includes supplying PII (name, e-mail address and a login for your account) and we use that information to create your account and give you access to our services. We will also request credit card or other payment details in order for you to pay for services.
We will request PII when you request information on Mirago products and services via our ‘contact us’ facility. This information includes name, e-mail address and any message you may wish to send us. This information is not stored or used beyond the scope of this service.
The Mirago ‘Send to a friend’ service requires the supply of the sender and recipients e-mail address. These e-mail addresses are not stored or used beyond the scope of this service.
If you refuse to supply information essential to operating any of Mirago´s products or services then we will not be able to offer you these services.
