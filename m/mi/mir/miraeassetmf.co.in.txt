Know Your Client (KYC) and prevention of Anti Money laundering laws.
To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, the
Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA) and Rules to Prevention of Money
Laundering (Amendment) Act, 2005 (PMLA Rules) requires all financial institutions to obtain,
verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account.
What this means for you: When you open an account, we will ask for your name, address, date
of birth (for individuals), PAN, bank account details and other information that will allow us to
identify you. We may also ask to see your driver’s license or other identifying documents. Let us
help you understand what are KYC and IPV.

once in the securities market and the KYC details would be subsequently shared with other
intermediaries. These changes would be applicable to new investors investing in mutual funds
w.e.f 1st January, 2012. However, existing KYC compliant investors of the Mutual Fund can
continue to invest as per the current practice. However, existing investors are also urged to
comply with the new KYC requirements including IPV as mandated by SEBI.

Online Security Tips
While Mirae Asset is committed to ensure the highest standard of security on our systems, you as
the end-user also play an important role to ensure that you are adequately protected when you
use the Internet. The following security best practices are recommended:
Install anti-virus, anti-spyware and other internet security software on your PC. Use it
regularly and keep it up-to-date.
Take advantage of your PC’s security features. Make sure your browser uses the
strongest encryption available and be aware of the encryption levels of the sites and
applications you use.
Regularly update your PC’s operating system and Web browser software with the
vendor’s software patches and updates to protect your PC against known vulnerabilities.
Do what you can to prevent unauthorized people from using your PC.
Change your passwords often. Be sure to choose passwords that are hard for others to
guess.
If you notice suspicious activity in your accounts, report it immediately to the appropriate
parties.
Do not download or open any attachments sent to you by unsolicited email. Once opened,
these programs may contain malicious programs that can compromise your PC’s security.
Be on the alert for phishing scams. Access Web sites by typing the Web addresses
directly into your Web browser or by using Web addresses you have bookmarked, instead
of via embedded links in unsolicited emails.
If you feel you may have received a fraudulent email appearing to come from Mirae Asset,
please contact your account representative, financial advisor or client service team, or email to
our grievance officer Mr. Girish Dhanani at dhanani.girish@miraeasset.com or may reach us at
customercare@miraeasset.com.
