Privacy Policy
The Internet is a fun place for work and for play. However, in order for you to get the best possible use from our sites it may be necessary, in some circumstances, for you to give us personal information about yourself. This policy tells you how we collect information from you, how we protect it and how we use it. We want to help make the Internet a safe and fun experience for you, your friends and your family.
Disneylandparis.com is owned, controlled and run by Euro Disney Associés S.C.A, a company incorporated under the laws of France and having its registered offices at 1, rue de la Galmy - 77700 Chessy, France and registered with the Commercial Register of Meaux under the number 397 471 822 ("Euro Disney"). It is Euro Disney's policy that we obey and respect the law in relation to privacy and protect our guests' personal information from possible misuse. We also allow you access to your personal information so that you can amend or delete the information we have about you or ask us to do it for you.
What type of information we collect about you
We collect two 'types' or categories of information about you:
1. The first type is information that personally identifies you. For example, your full name (your first name and your surname), your home (or work) address, your e-mail address, telephone number and postcode. We call this 'personally identifiable' information.
2. Other information you give us, by itself, is NOT personally identifiable i.e. that we cannot link to an identified person. For example, whether you are male or female, the times and dates you use are services, the country in which you live, the language you normally speak in, the number of children you have... We call this 'non-personally identifiable information' or 'aggregate' information.
What we do with 'Aggregate' information
Aggregate information allows us to see what 'types' of people use our site (for example, how many are girls and how many are boys). From time to time we may also run on-line surveys or questionnaires to collect your thoughts, opinions or suggestions as to how we can make our sites, products or services better for you. We may also share aggregate information with our advertisers, business partners, sponsors and third parties, so that they can better understand what type of person uses our sites.
Remember, this information is NOT personally identifiable information from which you can be identified.
What we do with Personally Identifiable information
We will only collect personally identifiable information during the following:
