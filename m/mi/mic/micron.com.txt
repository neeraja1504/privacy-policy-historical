If you choose to register with Micron, place an order with us, participate in one of our surveys or contests, apply for a job, or otherwise contact us or use our website, we may ask that you provide us with relevant information such as contact information (first and last name, business entity name, e-mail address, and telephone number), financial information (account or credit card numbers), demographic information (address, age, or income level), unique identifiers (tax ID number), information about where you learned of our products, information about your intended use of our products, data usage about your device and network used to connect to our products (for example, IP addresses), along with any other information you choose to provide to us. We may also supplement the data we directly collect from you with data collected from third parties.

In addition, our sales and marketing departments may use demographic information, information about where you learned of our products, and information about your intended use of our products to improve our advertising and marketing efforts and to measure interest in our products. We may also process your information for the purposes of detecting and preventing fraud, preserving or defending Micron’s legal rights, fulfilling orders and invoicing for goods and services, coordinating with sales and marketing activities, or for other legitimate business purposes consistent with the expectations of a reasonable person given the context of the collection.
