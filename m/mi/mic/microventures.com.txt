MicroVentures, Inc. owns and hosts a full service online platform at https://microventures.com (“Platform” or “the Platform”) through which MicroVenture Marketplace, Inc., a subsidiary of MicroVentures, Inc., offers various investment opportunities.
MicroVenture Marketplace is a registered broker/dealer and a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) and Securities Investor Protection Corporation (“SIPC”).  MicroVenture Marketplace offers the sale of private placements in early and late stage companies in various industries on a “best-efforts” basis, facilitates secondary transactions in private companies acting as a broker between buyers and sellers, and serves as a crowdfunding intermediary in accordance with Regulation CF.
As you (or the organization for which you are acting) access the Platform and its associated and/or affiliated services (collectively, “MicroVentures Services” or “Services”), we collect certain personal information. We understand that the confidentiality and security of this information is important, and we are committed to protecting the privacy of your personal information. This Privacy Policy is intended to summarize our data protection practices and to advise our registered users, investors, issuers, employees, website visitors, and other third parties about our privacy policies that may be applicable to them. It is specifically addressed to those who provide personal information to MicroVentures, Inc. and its associated and/or affiliated Services, or who visit or use our website, Platform, and social media sites.
By using the Platform, you agree to the terms and conditions of the User Agreement, including this Privacy Policy, and you consent to our privacy practices. We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy carefully.
What does MicroVentures, Inc. do with your personal information?
Financial companies choose how they collect, process, and potentially share your personal information. Consumers may limit some, but not all, sharing. Please read this notice carefully to understand how we collect, process, share, and protect your personal information.
We may use your personal information for the following purposes:
To facilitate investments as directed by you if you are or become a customer and/or to respond to requests or inquiries you may have;
To pursue legitimate interests, including to carry out, monitor, and analyze our business or operations;
To contact you regarding features and functionality that may be of interest to you;
To enter into or carry out contracts of various kinds;
To conduct monitoring by us or any other person on our behalf using various methods, including: (i) the use of automated monitoring tools; (ii) through random monitoring of systems; (iii) specific monitoring of systems for example in relation to investigations, regulatory requests, subject access requests, litigation, arbitration, or mediation; (iv) data tracking, aggregation and analysis tools that pull data to draw linkages and/or detect behavioral patterns, interactions or preferences for analysis (including predictive analysis); and/or (v) using other similar monitoring technology that may become available from time to time;
To comply with applicable laws or regulations in any country; or
For any other purpose for which your personal information was provided to us.
We may process your personal information for the following purposes after obtaining your express consent where legally required:
To communicate with you through the channels you have approved to keep you up to date on the latest developments, announcements and other information about our Services, products and technologies;
To conduct customer surveys, marketing campaigns, market analysis, or promotional activities;
To collect information about your preferences to create a user profile to personalize and foster the quality of our communication and interaction with you.
With regard to marketing-related communication, we will - where legally required - only provide you with such information after you have opted in. We also provide you with the opportunity to opt out at any time if you do not wish to receive further marketing-related communication from us.
Depending on the above permitted purposes, we may process your personal information on one or more of the following legal grounds:
Because processing is necessary for the execution of a client instruction or other contract with you;
To comply with our regulatory recordkeeping obligations; or
Because processing is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interest or those of any third-party recipients that receive your personal information, provided that such interests are not overridden by your interests or fundamental rights.
In addition, the processing may be based on your consent where you have expressly given that to us.
The types of personal information we collect and share depends on to what extent you use our Platform. This can include information:
Provided during the user registration or investment process, for example, your name, email address, telephone number, birth date, tax or other identification number, investment objectives, etc.;
Acquired as a result of investments you made through our Platform, such as banking information;
Received from consumer-reporting agencies; and
Collected through internet cookies.
As a general principle, you will provide us with your personal information entirely voluntarily. There are circumstances in which we cannot take action without certain of your personal information, for example, because it is required to process your instructions or provide you with access to our Services. In these cases, it will be impossible for us to act on your request without the relevant personal information, and we will notify you accordingly.
If you provide personal information to us about someone else (such as an account co-owner or authorized individual), you must ensure that you are entitled to disclose that personal information to us and that, without our taking any further steps, we may collect, use and disclose that personal information as described in this privacy policy. In particular, you must ensure that the individual concerned is aware of the various matters detailed in this Privacy Policy, as those matters relate to that individual, including our identity, how to contact us, our purposes of collection, our personal information disclosure practices, any right the individual may have to obtain access to the personal information, make complaints about the handling of the personal information, and the consequences if the personal information is not provided (such as our inability to provide services).
All financial companies need to share customers' personal information to run their everyday business. In the sections below, we list the reasons financial companies can share their customers' personal information and whether you can limit this sharing.
We may share your personal information in the following circumstances:
We may share your personal information between MicroVentures affiliates on a confidential basis as allowed by applicable law, where required for the purpose of providing products or services, and for administrative, billing and other business purposes;
We may instruct service providers within or outside of MicroVentures to process personal information on our behalf and in accordance with our instructions. MicroVentures generally either requires these service providers to enter into confidentiality agreements that limit their use of the information they receive or utilizes software as a service (SaaS) providers with whom confidentiality is delineated and verifiable. Such limitations prohibit the service provider from using MicroVentures customer information other than to carry out the purposes for which the information was disclosed.
We may share your personal information with companies providing services in the areas of fraud and crime prevention and with companies providing similar services, including financial institutions such as credit reference agencies and regulatory bodies;
Consistent with applicable law, we may share your personal information with courts, law enforcement authorities, regulators or attorneys or other parties for the establishment, exercise or defense of a legal or equitable claim or for the purposes of a confidential alternative dispute resolution process;
We may also use aggregated personal information and statistics for the purpose of monitoring website usage in order to help us develop our website and our Services.
Otherwise, we will only disclose your personal information when you direct us or give us permission to do so, when we are allowed or required by applicable law or regulations or judicial or official request to do so, or as required to investigate actual or suspected fraudulent or criminal activities.

Affiliates from using your information to market to you; and

State laws and laws or regulations applicable to the country in which you live may give you additional rights to limit sharing.
What happens when I limit sharing for an account I hold jointly with someone else?
