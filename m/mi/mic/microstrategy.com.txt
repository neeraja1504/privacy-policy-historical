In addition, we tell you how you can ask us to (i) access, change or not use the personal information we maintain about you, (ii) withdraw consent you previously provided to us, (iii) refrain from sending you certain communications, and (iv) answer questions you may have about our privacy practices.
Please note that this Privacy Policy only applies to this Site and that other MicroStrategy-affiliated websites are subject to their own privacy policies. Please also note that if you are accessing this Site from a country in the European Economic Area* or Switzerland, your use of this Site is subject to the privacy policy found here.
How We May Collect or Receive Information from You
We may collect or receive your personal information from you through your use of the Site in various ways. You may choose to submit your personal information and other information to us through various communication channels provided on the "Contact Us" webpage of the Site, for example, by email, or telephone.

Cookies
In addition, when you visit the Site, we may collect certain information by automated means, such as cookies. A "cookie" is a file that websites send to a visitor's computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor's browser or to store information or settings on the device. The information we collect in this manner enables us to better serve you when you return to our site- for example, it can "remember" your email address to save you having to enter it manually upon your return. We also use cookies to track responses to our marketing materials, such as emails and online advertisements. Your browser may tell you how to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies or how to restrict or disable certain types of cookies. For more information about MicroStrategy’s own cookies, please see “How to work with Cookies.”
The Site may also feature cookies associated with certain unaffiliated companies. For example, we partner with other companies to provide you with connections to certain social networks, such as Facebook and Twitter, and to provide you with additional features such as YouTube. By engaging with such other companies’ sites, for instance, by clicking the Facebook "Like" button found on our Site, such companies may place session or persistent cookies on your device. The use of these cookies is subject to such companies’ own cookie policies, which MicroStrategy strongly recommends you review before you use the Site.
Web Analytics and Interest-Based Advertising
We may use web analytics services on this site, such as those of Google Analytics. The service providers that administer these services use technologies such as cookies to help us analyze how visitors use the site. The information collected through these means (including IP address) is disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to evaluate use of the website or for advertising purposes, as described below.
Some of our online advertising takes place through Google Display Advertising. As part of this program, we use Google Analytics features such as Retargeting. In connection with that feature and others offered by ad networks, we and the operators of ad networks, including Google, may use third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) – and in some cases first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) – to inform, optimize, and serve ads across the internet based on a user’s past visits to our website.
You can opt out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising or customize Google Display Network ads using the Google Ads Preferences Manager. To disable Google Analytics in general, please download the browser add-on for the deactivation of Google Analytics provided by Google at http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout. To learn more about other ad networks, including how to opt out, click here.
The Types of Information We May Collect

We may request this information from you in connection with activities such as account creation, use of services, downloads of our software, inquiries about becoming a MicroStrategy partner, inquiries about jobs at MicroStrategy, job applications, conference or training registrations, purchases of products and services and requests for support. In connection with job inquiries and job applications we may require additional personal information from you, such as your education history.
