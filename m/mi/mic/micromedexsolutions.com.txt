This privacy policy was last updated on September 12, 2013.
This privacy statement is designed to tell you how Truven Health Analytics uses and secures your personal information. This privacy statement describes the practices of the Truven Health Analytics Community, which is presently offered by the following businesses of Truven Health Analytics: Clinical Decision Support, including legacy MercuryMD and Micromedex. As described below, this privacy statement relates solely to the online and offline information collection and use practices of the Truven Health Analytics Community.
Information that We Collect
In general, you may browse online many parts of the Truven Health Analytics Community without providing any personal information. The information we collect from web site visitors is collected on an aggregate basis as you and others browse our web sites, and is not used to identify you in any way.
If you want to interact with Truven Health Analytics and take advantage of the materials available from Truven Health Analytics, you may register with Truven Health Analytics and join the Truven Health Analytics Community. You may register online at any of our web sites or offline, by providing us with personal information via phone, facsimile or mail. Registration is completely voluntary and free. When you join the Truven Health Analytics Community, we collect:
contact information (such as name, and email address), and
other personal information (such as information about your professional background, practice and areas of specialization as well as any other personal information that you choose to provide us.)
We will tailor the materials we provide you based on the information in your profile, such as specialty.

provide you with additional information that may be of interest, including marketing and educational materials from us and our partners
If you purchase a product from us (such as a product or newsletter subscription), you may provide us with a credit card number. This credit card number will only be used to process your purchase. We will not disclose credit card numbers to any third party for marketing purposes under any circumstances.
Unless you tell us not to, we may also provide information about you or your practice to other business units of Truven Health Analytics. Truven Health Analytics also publish various quality programs and products, and we may include information about your practice in those items.
We may also share your information with other third parties who perform services for us, but we forbid these companies from using your personal information for their own purposes.

For example, we may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena. We may also disclose information about you in connection with the transfer of assets of our business. Additionally, as we continue to develop the Truven Health Analytics Community, we might sell or buy business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing privacy notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise).
