3. Условия доставки по сети DHL Express.
3.1. Отправитель и Получатель согласны с тем, что для транспортировки грузов по сети DHL Express применяются обычные Условия доставки DHL Express, основные положения которых, важные для Получателя, перечислены ниже:
Доставка и невозможность доставки
Грузы не могут быть доставлены по адресам абонентских ящиков или с указанием только почтовых индексов. Грузы доставляются по адресу Грузополучателя, указанному Грузоотправителем, однако, не обязательно лично Грузополучателю. Доставка Грузов, адресованных в центральную зону получения грузов, производится именно в эту зону.
«DHL» может уведомить Грузополучателя о предстоящей доставке или пропуске доставки. Грузополучателю могут быть предложены альтернативные варианты доставки, в том числе доставка в другой день, доставка без подписи, перенаправление по другому адресу или самовывоз из сервисного отделения «DHL». Некоторые варианты доставки могут быть исключены по требованию Грузоотправителя.
В случае неприемлемости груза, как указано в ст. 2, его заниженной таможенной стоимости, невозможности нахождения или идентификации Грузополучателя с помощью разумных мер, отказа Грузополучателя от доставки или оплаты Таможенных пошлин или иных связанных с Грузом сборов «DHL» предпримет все зависящие от него меры для возврата Груза Грузоотправителю за счет последнего; в противном случае Груз поступает в распоряжение «DHL» и может быть выдан, отчужден или реализован по его усмотрению без какой-либо ответственности перед Грузоотправителем и любыми иными лицами, а вырученные от реализации денежные средства за вычетом Таможенных пошлин, связанных с Грузом сборов и соответствующих административных расходов подлежат возврату Грузоотправителю. «DHL» вправе уничтожить любой Груз, который «DHL» не может вернуть Грузоотправителю в силу закона, а также любой Груз, содержаний Опасные грузы во вложении.
Инспектирование
«DHL» имеет право вскрывать и инспектировать Грузы без уведомления в целях обеспечения безопасности, таможенного декларирования или в соответствии с иными регламентирующими и нормативными актами.
Ответственность «DHL»
Ответственность «DHL» в отношении любого Груза, перевозка которого осуществляется авиационным транспортом (включая вспомогательную перевозку автотранспортом или остановки на маршруте) ограничена в соответствии с Монреальской или Варшавской конвенциями, или, при неприменимости указанных конвенций -   меньшей из следующих сумм: (i) текущая рыночная или объявленная стоимость или (ii) 19 специальных прав заимствования за килограмм (приблизительно 26,00 долл.США за килограмм). Такие ограничения также применяются ко всем иным видам грузоперевозок, с тем исключением, что в случае перевозки Грузов автомобильным транспортом действуют ограничения, перечисленные ниже.
В случае международной перевозки Грузов автомобильным транспортом ответственность «DHL» ограничивается или считается ограниченной условиями Конвенции о договоре международной перевозки грузов автомобильным транспортом (КДПГ) в размере меньшей из следующих сумм: (i) текущая рыночная или объявленная стоимость или (ii) 8,33 специальных прав заимствования за килограмм (приблизительно 14,00 долл.США за килограмм). В отсутствие подлежащих применению в силу закона  или более низких ограничений ответственности в действующем национальном законодательстве такие ограничения также применяются к внутренней перевозке грузов автомобильным транспортом.
Если Грузоотправитель сочтет вышеприведенные предельные суммы выплат недостаточными, он должен отдельно объявить ценность груза и заявить о необходимости его страхования в соответствии с положениями Раздела 8 (Страхование Грузов), либо самостоятельно застраховать Груз.
Размер ответственности «DHL» однозначно ограничивается непосредственным реальным ущербом, причиненным Грузу в результате его повреждения либо утраты, и не может превышать предельных значений в расчете на килограмм веса Груза согласно настоящему Разделу  6. Не подлежат возмещению любые иные виды убытков или ущерба, (включая, помимо прочего, упущенную выгоду, процентный доход и деловую перспективу), вне зависимости от того, является ли подобный ущерб и убытки особыми или косвенными, даже в том случае, если «DHL» было поставлено в известность о риске возникновения подобного ущерба или убытков.
«DHL» обязуется приложить все разумные усилия для доставки Груза согласно обычному графику доставки «DHL», однако такой график не является обязательным и не входит в состав договора. «DHL» не несет ответственности за ущерб или убытки, вызванные задержкой, однако в случае определенных Грузов Грузоотправитель вправе потребовать ограниченную компенсацию за задержку согласно условиям Гарантии возврата денег, с которыми можно ознакомиться на интернет сайте «DHL»  по адресу www.dhl.com или обратившись в DHL.
Срок предъявления претензий
Все претензии должны быть заявлены «DHL» в письменном виде в течение 30 (тридцати) дней с момента приема груза «DHL»; в противном случае «DHL» не будет нести по претензиям никакой ответственности. В отношении одного Груза можно заявить только одну претензию, при этом ее урегулирование является полным и окончательным урегулированием всех требований о возмещении ущерба и убытков в отношении такого Груза.
Независящие от «DHL» обстоятельства
«DHL» не несет ответственность за какой-либо ущерб и убытки, вызванные не зависящими от «DHL» обстоятельствами. Указанные обстоятельства, помимо прочего, включают: негативное воздействие электрических или магнитных полей на электронные или фотографические изображения, данные или записи или их стирание, любые дефекты или характеристики, обусловленные характером Груза, даже если о них было сообщено «DHL»; любые действия или бездействие лиц, не являющихся сотрудниками или подрядчиками «DHL», а именно, Грузоотправителя, Грузополучателя, третьей стороны, таможенных органов или иных официальных лиц; «Форс-мажорные обстоятельства» — землетрясение, циклон, ураган, наводнение, туман, военные действия, катастрофа воздушного судна, эмбарго, мятеж, массовые беспорядки или производственные конфликты.
Маршрут следования
Грузоотправитель соглашается с любым маршрутом следования и отклонениями от него, включая возможность прохождения Груза через промежуточные перевалочные пункты.
Применимое законодательство
Любые споры, возникающие из настоящих Условий, или в связи с ними, в интересах «DHL» подлежат рассмотрению в судах страны отправления Груза и регулируются законодательством этой страны, при этом Грузоотправитель обязуется признать указанную юрисдикцию, если это не противоречит действующему законодательству.
