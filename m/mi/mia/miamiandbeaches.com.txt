II.1. What Information We Collect
The information collected on our digital platforms is used to determine important statistical data for the GMCVB, its partners and members to determine the effectiveness of the content, programs and advertisements offered through our website. We also collect information to provide better services to all our users — from things like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you'll find most useful, the interests that matter most to you online, or which videos you might like to watch. The information the GMCVB collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
The GMCVB, its partners and affiliates collect personal contact and demographic information that the consumer willingly provides such as name, address, zip code and email address with the intention of using this information for purposes of statistical reporting and targeted promotional campaigns. Contact information may be used to send administrative and promotional materials from the GMCVB and/or its partners and affiliates. We do not collect or store sensitive data such as Race or ethnic origin, Political opinions, Religious or philosophical beliefs, Trade union memberships, Genetic or biometric data, Health or mortality, Sex life or sexual orientation.
We also collect behavioral data based on user's preferences to enhance the user digital experiences and interactions, which includes products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads and embedded maps. We also receive information from advertisers to provide advertising and research services on their behalf. You always have the option of discontinuing the remittance of these by contacting us (please see Opt-In / Opt-Out, below).
When signed in to a GMCVB website or app, we collect data such as unique identifiers, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request.
We collect this information when a service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you're using a mobile device, your device may periodically contact our servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your device type, carrier name, crash reports, and which apps you've installed.
We also collect information that we store with your account, which we treat as personal information and can include information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend content you might like. We may collect information about your location when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions for your weekend getaway or restaurants you have previously shown an interest in that are near you.
When you're not signed in to a GMCVB Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you're using. This helps us do things like maintain your language preferences across browsing sessions. We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results.
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including analytics.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognize patterns in data.
III. Security of Personal Information
We exercise reasonable care to protect your non-public personal information. This includes storing the personal information on our servers behind a secured firewall and ensuring all transmissions to other vendors use secure encryption technology.
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. So while we strive to protect your non-public personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us or receive from us. This is especially true for information you transmit to us via email. We have no way of protecting that information until it reaches us. Once we receive your transmission, we maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your personal information.
Internally, we will limit access to non-public personal information to those associates who need the information to provide products and services to you or maintain or service those products or services. These associates are limited in number, and are committed to our privacy and security policies. We will review our security arrangements from time to time, as we deem appropriate.
IV. Sharing of Non-Public Personal Information
We reserve the right to, without notice to you, share non-public personal information with companies that work for us for the sole purpose of providing you with valuable services you've requested or already have. These companies may assist us in fulfilling your requests or processing your transactions.
We will only share information with companies that work for us to provide marketing and other services and with non-affiliated persons and entities with whom we have entered into a joint marketing agreement, where we together market either our products or those of our marketing partner if you expressly authorize us to share this information. These companies are contractually forbidden from disclosing or using our customer information other than to carry out the purposes for which the information was disclosed. These companies are in no way authorized to sell, rent or trade your personal information. While there are such contractual obligations in place, we cannot and do not guarantee that a third party could breach its obligation and use your non-public personal information in a way contrary to our policy.
We may disclose information, including non-public personal information, in special cases when we have a good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with the legal process such as, but not limited to situations when we are required to do so by federal, state or local laws and regulations or when we receive a subpoena or are ordered by a court to do so; (b) protect and defend our rights; or (c) act to protect the interests of our users or others. Additionally, we may, without notice to you, provide aggregate statistics about visitors to MiamiandBeaches.com, such as volume, traffic patterns and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personal information.
V. Email Communication from GMCVB
You will only receive email from the GMCVB if you have registered on one of our digital platforms, signed up to receive promotional or other information, have communicated with us via email and/or requested a response via email. We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. These emails may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services as well as optional opt-in promotional information such as special offers or visitor information. If you are currently on our list and do not wish to receive further information from us, see Opt-In / Opt-Out, below.
