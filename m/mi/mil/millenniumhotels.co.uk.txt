14.6  Your right to object.
You can ask us to stop processing your personal information, and we will do so, if we are:
relying on our own or someone else’s legitimate interests to process your personal information, except if we can demonstrate compelling legal grounds for the processing; or
processing your personal information for direct marketing.
14.7  Your rights in relation to automated decision-making and profiling.
You have the right not to be subject to a decision when it is based on automatic processing, including profiling, if it produces a legal effect or similarly significantly affects you.  However, we may conduct automated decision-making and/or profiling where it is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between you and us.
Examples of automated decision-making and/or profiling include if we use software to automatically scan employment applications and match candidates to job vacancies, or if we were to utilise an aptitude test with algorithms or automated criteria for decision-making in our recruitment process.
14.8  Your right to withdraw consent.
If we rely on your consent (or explicit consent) as our legal basis for processing your personal information, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time.
14.9  Your right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority.
If you have a concern about any aspect of our privacy practices, including the way we have handled your personal information, you can report it to the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). You can find details about how to do this on the ICO website at https://ico.org.uk/concerns/ or by calling their helpline on 0303 123 1113.
