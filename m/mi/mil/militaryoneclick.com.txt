viruses or otherwise harm your computer. Many cookies last only through a
single website session, or visit. Others may have an expiration date, or may
remain on your computer until you delete them.
We may use cookies for a number of purposes - for example, to maintain
continuity during a user session, to gather data about the usage of our website
for research and other purposes, to store your preferences for certain kinds of
information and marketing offers, or to store a user name or encrypted
identification number so that you do not have to provide this information every
time you return to our website.
Our cookies will track only your activity relating to your online activity on this
website, and will not track your other Internet activity. Our cookies do not
gather personally identifiable information.

We may occasionally use other companies to set cookies on our website and

company to operate web servers for our website.                         We use the cookie
information gathered by these companies in the same manner as stated above.
In addition to the information we collect from cookies, we also obtain information which you
provide to us online - for example, when you sign up for product updates or when you purchase
products or otherwise communicate with us. In some cases, we retain both the cookie
information and/or the information you provide to us online - for example, to complete a
transaction you requested or to keep historical records of your past transactions. In other cases,
we only retain the cookie and/or online information you give us if you request us to do so for
your use in subsequent sessions.
