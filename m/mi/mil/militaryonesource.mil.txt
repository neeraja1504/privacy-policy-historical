Principal Purpose(s) : To document and verify the eligibility of callers and identify your inquiry or issue so that we may provide a warm hand-off, referral and/or requested information. Records may be used as a management tool for statistical analysis, tracking, reporting, and evaluating program effectiveness and conducting research. However, if you indicate you may represent a threat to self or others, you will be reported to the appropriate authorities in accordance with DoD/military branch of service and component regulations and established protocols.
Routine Use(s) : In addition to those disclosures generally permitted under 5 U.S.C. 552a(b) of the Privacy Act, these records may be disclosed outside the DoD as a routine use pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(3) as follows: To authorized DoD military occupational specialty contractors for the purpose of responding to service member or family member need. To contractors and grantees for the purpose of supporting research studies concerned with the effectiveness of non-medical counseling interventions. To local law enforcement entities for the purpose of intervention to prevent harm to the individual (self) in accordance with DoD/military branch of service and component regulations and established protocols. Any release of information contained in this system of records outside the DoD under a routine use will be compatible with the purpose(s) for which the information is collected and maintained. The DoD Blanket Routine Uses set forth at the beginning of the Office of the Secretary of Defense compilation of systems or records notices may apply to this system.
Disclosure : Voluntary; however, if you do not provide information needed to determine your eligibility for non-medical counseling and specialty consultations, you may not be able to receive those services.
