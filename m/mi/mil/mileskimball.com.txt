Sales and use taxes are imposed by state and local jurisdictions on goods purchased at retail by consumers.  Retailers subject to state law are required to collect the state’s sales and use taxes from their customers.  Miles Kimball collects the applicable sales tax on all orders shipped to Wisconsin.  As a result of a recent US Supreme Court decision, we are now required to collect sales and use taxes in many other states.  Each state and local jurisdiction has its own rules for what are “taxable goods” and what are exempt goods.  For states imposing sales or use taxes, your purchase is subject to use tax unless it is specifically exempt from taxation. Your purchase is not exempt merely because it is made over the Internet, by catalog or by other remote means. Many states require purchasers to file a use tax return at the end of the year reporting all of the taxable purchases that were not taxed by a retailer, and to pay tax on those purchases.
Effective January 1, 2019, we will collect for AL, CO, CT, GA, HI, IL, IN, IA, KY, LA, MD, ME, MA, MI, MN, MS, NE, NV, NJ, NC, ND, OK, PA, RI, SD, UT, VT, WA, WV, WI and DC.  We will start collecting sales tax effective February 1, 2019 for SC and WY and effective April 1, 2019 for CA.  We will update this disclosure as new states enact sales and use tax collection laws.
For mail orders:   To ensure that your order is processed, you must add sales tax for the address to which the order will be shipped. Please see https://www.vertexinc.com/resources/tax-rate-calculator to look-up the correct rate.
If you live in Puerto Rico , please read this information about sales and use tax.  The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico requires Puerto Rico purchasers to report all purchases that were not taxed and pay tax on those purchases.  Sales and use taxes may be reported and paid by filing Form SC 2970A, Declaration of Use of Imported Goods and Services, and pay the corresponding tax.  Individuals must file the declaration with the payment through the electronic system known as Unified Internal Revenue System (SURI).  Circular Letter 17-08 issued by the Puerto Rico Treasury Department provides further information and instructions.

The parties will share equally in the costs assessed for the arbitration and each party will bear its own attorneys’ fees and costs. Any arbitration proceeding may not be consolidated or joined with any other proceeding and will not proceed as a class action.  The parties understand that they would have had a right or opportunity to litigate Disputes through a court, to have a judge or jury decide their case, and to participate in a class action or other proceeding involving multiple claimants, but they have instead chosen to have all Disputes decided through individual arbitration.
c. Place; Federal Arbitration Act.  The place of arbitration will be Winnebago County, Wisconsin, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by all parties to the arbitration.

The combined total of your separate shipping charges will never exceed the original shipping charge authorized during checkout.
There may be additional charges for international shipments (see International FAQs).
To substantially decrease shipping time, it is recommended that shipments to Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and US Territories be done via USPS Priority Mail (see “Do you have express shipping?” above for more details)

IP Addresses, Location Data, and Related Data.  When you visit or use the Site, we may automatically collect certain information from your device. In some countries, including countries in the European Economic Area (“ EEA ”), this information may be considered personal information under applicable data protection laws. Specifically, the servers used to operate and provide the Site may collect data pertaining to you and the equipment, software, and communication methods you use to access the Internet and the Site, including Internet protocol (“ IP ”) addresses assigned to the computers and other devices from where you access the Internet, your Internet service provider, your device ID number, your approximate geographic location, your browser type, the pages you access on the Site, the websites you access before and after visiting the Site, the length of time you spend on the Site, date and time stamps, and clickstream data. We may use this information to administer the Site and our servers, to generate statistical information, to monitor and analyze Site traffic and usage patterns, to monitor and prevent fraud, to investigate complaints and violations of our policies, and to improve the Site’s content and the products, services, materials, and other content that we describe or make available through the Site. We may combine this information with other Collected Information (including personal information) and information obtained from third parties for the purposes discussed below. The suppliers that we use to provide the Site may collect information about your visits to the Site and other websites. Some of this information may be collected using cookies and similar tracking technologies as explained further below under “Cookies.”
Cookies.  The Site may automatically use cookies to track your use of the Site in order to facilitate and enhance the user experience on the Site and for other purposes as described below. “ Cookies ” are small pieces of information that are stored on your device’s hard drive by your browser. The Site may use both cookies that we implement and cookies implemented by our suppliers and other third parties. We use cookies to track how you access and use the Site, to learn when and how users visit the Site, to learn how popular Site pages are and aren’t, to learn which search terms are used to find the Site, and to learn which websites direct you to the Site. We also use cookies to help display certain information on the Site and to improve your enjoyment of the Site, for example, by remembering your contact and other information when you access or use the Site. Most browsers automatically accept cookies. You can disable this function, but disabling cookies may impact your use and enjoyment of the Site. Our Site suppliers may use cookies and other tracking technologies, such as pixel tags, to track Site visitors across the Internet to understand how you get to the Site. We do not have access or control over these cookies and this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of third-party cookies.  Due to this automatic collection of data using cookies, we do not honor “do not track” requests. Our use of these technologies fall into the following categories:
Operationally necessary.  These are cookies that are required for the operation of the Site. For example, these cookies are required to identify irregular website behavior, prevent fraudulent activity, and improve security. They also allow users of the Site to make use of its functions, for example, shopping carts, saved search, and similar functions. Without these cookies, Sites that you have requested cannot be provided.
Functionality related.  These cookies allow us to offer you enhanced functionality when accessing or using the Site. This may include to remembering choices you make, for example and as applicable, remembering your username, preferences, or settings, remembering if you reacted to something on or through the Site so that you are not asked to do it again, remembering if you have used any feature of the Site before, restricting the number of times you are shown a particular advertisement, remembering your location, and enabling social media components. As described above, you may disable functional cookies, but if you do so then various functions of the Site may be unavailable to you or may not work the way you want them to.
Performance related.  These cookies assess the performance of the Site, including as part of our analytic practices to help us understand how visitors use and interact with the Site, for example, which pages on our websites users visit most often. These cookies also enable us to personalize content and remember your preferences (e.g., your choice of language, country, or region). These cookies help us improve the way our websites work and provide a better, personalized user experience. Some of our performance-related cookies are managed for us by third parties. However, we don’t allow those third parties to use the cookies for any purpose other than those listed above.
Advertising or targeted related.  These cookies record your visits to the Site, the pages you have visited on our websites, and the links you have clicked. They gather information about your browsing habits and remember that you have visited a particular website. We and our third-party advertising platforms or networks may use this information to make the Site, its content, and advertisements displayed on our websites more relevant to your interests (this is sometimes called “behavioral” or “targeted” advertising and is further discussed below). These types of cookies are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement and to help measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. To find out more about interest-based ads and your choices, please visit the Digital Advertising Alliance, the Network Advertising Initiative, the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) Europe, http://www.allaboutcookies.org, and http://www.youronlinechoices.com.
Analytics.  The Site uses third-party analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics, provided by Google Inc.) to collect and process data (including personal data) about your use of the Site, including when you visit the Site, URLs of the websites that you visit prior to visiting the Site and when you visit those websites, and IP addresses assigned to the devices from where you access the Internet. Our analytics providers may set and read cookies to collect this data and your web browser will automatically send data collected by those cookies to our analytics providers. Our analytics providers use this data to provide us with reports that we will use to improve the Site’s structure and content. For more information on how Google uses collected data, visit Google’s Privacy Policy and Google’s page on "How Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps". To prevent this data from being used by Google Analytics, follow the instructions to download and install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on for each web browser you use. Using the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on will not prevent Company from using other analytics tools and will not prevent data from being sent to the Site itself or to Google. For more information about how Google Analytics uses cookies to measure user interactions on websites, visit Google Analytics Cookie Usage on Websites. You may disable cookies as discussed above, but that may impact your use and enjoyment of the Site. ** **
Advertising Networks, Personalized Advertising, Remarketing, and Retargeting.  From time to time the Site may use or participate in advertising networks and related advertising services that are managed and provided by third-party advertising servers, advertising agencies, technology vendors, and research firms, including, as discussed below, Google AdWords. These services collect information about your visits to and interactions with the Site and other websites and will use that information to target advertisements for goods and services. The information collected may be associated with your personal information. These targeted advertisements may appear on the Site or on other websites. Advertising networks often gather data about consumers who view advertisements to make inferences about a consumer’s interests and preferences, which enables their computers to deliver advertisements directly targeted to the consumer’s specific interests. This practice is often referred to as “online behavioral advertising.” For example, a third-party advertising network might collect the type of Internet browser you use, the type of computer operating system you use, the domain name of a website you visit, whether or not you visit specific pages of the Site and other websites, the location of your Internet service provider, the date and time of a visit to a website, and other interactions between you and a website.
We use Google AdWords, an online advertising service provided by Google, to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet and sometimes on the Site. Google uses your Internet searches, cookies, and similar identifiers (e.g., pixel tags) to collect information about your visits to the Site and your interaction with our products and services to generate targeted advertisements to you on other websites that you visit across the Internet. To opt out of remarketing advertising provided through Google, to customize your ad preferences, or to limit Google’s collection or use this information, visit Google’s Safety Center and Google’s Ad Settings and follow Google’s personalized ad opt-out instructions. Opting out will not affect your use of the Site.
To change your preferences with respect to certain online ads and to obtain more information about third-party ad networks and online behavioral advertising, please visit the   National Advertising Initiative Consumer opt-out page **  or the  Digital Advertising Alliance Self-Regulatory Program .**  Please remember that changing your settings with individual browsers or ad networks will not necessarily carry over to other browsers or ad networks. As a result, depending on the opt-outs you request, you may still see our ads from time to time.
Single Sign-On.  You may sign up for and log into your account using your Amazon.com account by providing your Amazon log-in information on the Site when prompted. If you choose to use this feature, Company may access, handle, and store information that you have provided through Amazon and make that information available on the Site. This feature may require us to implement cookies, plug-ins, and application protocol interfaces (APIs) provided by Amazon to facilitate those communications and features. We do not and cannot control any policies or terms of any third-party service, including those of Amazon. All information you have provided to Amazon is subject to the Amazon Privacy Notice. ** **
Social Media.  The Site may allow you to connect to and share information with various social media platforms, for example, Facebook. These features may require us to implement cookies, plug-ins, and application protocol interfaces (APIs) provided by those social media platforms to facilitate those communications and features. We may share information that you provide us or that we may collect about your use of the Site with those platforms and that information will be subject to their privacy policies. We encourage you to review those platforms’ privacy policies: see Facebook’s Data Policy. In addition, by choosing to use any third-party social media platform or choosing to share content or communications with any social media platform, you allow us to share information with the designated social media platform. We cannot control any policies or terms of such third party platform. As a result, we cannot be responsible for any use of your information or content by a third party platform, which you use at your own risk.
The Site may also use the advertising services and networks offered by those social media platforms to deliver advertising content. Use of these services requires social media platforms to implement cookies or pixel tags to deliver ads to you while you are logged into the platform.
If you do not wish a social media platform to collect information relating to you via the Site, we suggest that you: (a) hide social media platform plug-ins using an ad blocker; (b) always log off completely from the social media platform before visiting other websites and delete all related cookies; and, (c) where the option made available by the social media platform, disable the advertising services and networks operated by that platform.
The Company is active on social media, including Facebook. You have the opportunity to comment on those social media platforms regarding Company and the products and services we offer. We reserve the right to post on our websites and social media pages any comments or content that you post on our social media pages. ** **
Embedded Content.  The Site may incorporate content, including feeds scripts embedded in the Site’s code and visible content (for example, videos), provided by third parties. In some cases, those third parties collect data about how you interact with their content. For example, YouTube may collect or otherwise have access to usage data on videos embedded on the Site as described in YouTube’s Privacy Policy.
**How We Use and Share Collected Information  **
In addition to the uses described above, we and our suppliers may use and disclose Collected Information as described below. We do not use, sell, rent, or disclose Collected Information except as stated in this Privacy Policy and as permitted by applicable law.

If you register for an account on the Site, we will use Collected Information to communicate with you regarding your account. You may opt out of receiving promotional emails from us at any time by following the unsubscribe instructions contained in the applicable email or by contacting us using the contact information provided below under “Contact Us.”
Sharing Collected Information with Our Suppliers.  We may share Collected Information with our Site management and hosting suppliers, payment processors, marketing and public relations service providers, email service suppliers, and other suppliers as necessary for us to provide the Site and our products and services to you, to engage in the use and sharing of Collected Information as permitted by this Privacy Policy, and as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law. Our suppliers are authorized to and may use and disclose Collected Information as necessary for them to provide the applicable services to us and as provided by their own privacy policies as noted above.
Sharing Collected Information with Our Partners.  We may share certain aggregated Collected Information, such as zip codes and products purchased, with our affiliates and with the third-party manufacturers and providers of the products that we sell to help those third parties learn about the sales and success of their products. ** **
Sharing Collected Information with Other Third Parties.  We may share, rent, license, or sell Collected Information with third parties who have or offer products or services we think may be of interest to you. You may opt out of receiving communications from any such third party pursuant to such third party’s policies. We do not control any third party or their policies. ** **
Aggregate Data.  We may aggregate personal information and other Collected Information to create aggregate data on Site users, which describes users as a group but does not reveal the identity of individual users. We may use aggregate data to understand Site users’ needs, to determine Site user demographics and usage patterns, to determine what kinds of products and services we can provide, and to improve and enrich our products, our services, and the Site.
Evaluation and Improvement of the Site.  We may use Collected Information: to analyze, develop, and improve the content, materials, products, and services that we make available through the Site and the Site’s functionality; to inform marketing and communication plans and strategies; to evaluate user needs and customize Site content, promotional emails, and your browsing experience; and for other legitimate and lawful business purposes.
To Protect Company and Others.  We may share your personal information with law enforcement, regulatory authorities, courts with competent jurisdictions, emergency services, and other necessary third parties for legal, protection, security, and safety purposes, including: (a) to comply with laws or regulatory requirements and to respond to lawful requests and legal process; (b) to perform credit checks, report or collect debts owed; (c) to protect our rights and property, our agents and customers, and others, including to enforce our agreements, policies, and terms and to protect our network and physical assets; and (d) to protect the safety of our employees, agents, and customers, and any other person. ** **
Business Transactions.  We may choose to buy or sell assets from time to time. We may share Collected Information in connection with the evaluation of those transactions. We may transfer Collected Information if we enter into those transactions. Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control or reorganization, personal information and other Collected Information could be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party.
With Your Consent.  With your consent, we may share your personal information in ways not specifically described in this Privacy Policy.
Legal Basis for Processing Your Personal Information (EEA Only) ** **
If you are an individual from the EEA, our legal basis for collecting and using personal information will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. However, we will normally collect personal information from you only where: (a) we have your consent to do so; (b) where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you (e.g., to deliver services you have requested); or (c) where the processing is in our or a third party’s legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person.
If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and will advise you whether or not the provision of your personal information is mandatory, as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information. Similarly, if we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our or a third party’s legitimate interests that are not already described in this Privacy Policy, we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.
If you have any questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us using the contact details provided further below provided below under “Contact Us.”
International Transfers of Your Personal Information
In operating the Site, your personal information may be transferred to, stored in, and processed in countries other than the country in which you are resident. Those countries may have data protection laws that are different from those of your country and, in some cases, may not be as protective. Specifically, our Site servers and some of our service providers are located in the United States and our affiliated companies and third-party service providers and partners operate around the world. This means that when we collect your personal information we may process it in other countries. We have, however, taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
**Information Security  **
Company does not guarantee that loss, misuse, or alteration of Collected Information will not occur, but we take appropriate technical and organizational security measures in place to help protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of Collected Information under our control. Specifically, on our shopping cart and payment pages, Secure Socket Layers technology is used to encrypt information passed between your browser and our systems. While we are focused on the security of your personal information and follow strict standards, processes and procedures that designed to protect your personal information, you must remember that the Internet is a global communications vehicle open to threats, viruses and intrusions from others and so we cannot promise, and you should not expect, that we will be able to protect your personal information at all times and in all circumstances.
If you become aware of any breach of Site security or this Privacy Policy, please notify us at privacy@mileskimball.com immediately. If our security system is breached, we will notify you of the breach only if and to the extent required under applicable law.
How Long We Retain Your Personal Information
We will retain your personal information for as long as is needed to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (e.g., tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if that is not possible (e.g., because your personal information has been stored in back-up archives), we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
For personal information that we process on behalf of our customers, we will retain that personal information in accordance with the terms of our agreement with them, subject to applicable law.

If you wish to access, correct, update or request deletion of your personal information, you can do so at any time by visiting your account or contacting us at privacy@mileskimball.com.

About Us
Click on the question below to expand the answer
The Miles Kimball Company is a leader in the catalog business — offering cards, gifts, helpful household items, and unique food products. Operating from the shores of the Fox River in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, the business consists of several distinct catalogs: Miles Kimball, Christmas Cards by Miles Kimball, and Mrs. Kimball’s Candy Shoppe. It started almost 80 years ago, when an ambitious young man named Miles went into business with a simple idea: to market a Christmas card in which the design spelled out the name of the sender. With a Minneapolis phone book and some borrowed cash, Miles printed and mailed a card personalized “Johnson” to every household with that name in the Twin Cities. The response was fantastic, and provided Miles Kimball with enough seed money to produce his first catalog. Decades later, Christmas cards — the idea that started it all — are still produced and personalized in Oshkosh. Specializing in exclusively designed ornaments, labels, children’s accessories, outdoor decor and gifts, the personal touch continues to be the Miles Kimball hallmark. As we continue to grow, we remain true to our founder’s vision: to provide you with the unique, the unusual and the unexpected. We hope you return to our site often to discover what we have in store.

Silver Star Brands strongly opposes slavery and human trafficking, and would never knowingly conduct business with suppliers of retail products who engage in such practices. With each wholesale order, our business partners are required to certify that all applicable laws are followed in regards to slavery and human trafficking. Our supply chain staff ensure the enforcement of this policy with purchase agreements that prominently state this requirement to our vendors.
Our purchase orders include a provision that requires our vendors to agree to comply with all applicable laws regarding slavery and human trafficking. Silver Star Brands requires that no goods be manufactured in whole or in part with prison labor, forced labor, indentured labor or child labor.
