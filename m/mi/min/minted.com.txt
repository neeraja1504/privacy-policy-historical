This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) explains how Minted, LLC ("Minted") handles your personal information we collect when you use our services over the Internet, including the Minted website located at www.minted.com and affiliated domains controlled by Minted (the “Website”).
Please review this Policy carefully.  By using the Website or any of the services we provide, you agree to the personal data practices explained below.  If you do not agree with these practices, please do not use the Website or otherwise provide us with your personal information.
Registration
We do not require registration in order to browse the Website. You may choose to give us your contact information during registration or at other times. We then may use that information to contact you about the products and services on our site. Registration is required to use certain interactive features such as reviewing products, saving designs, and placing orders. We offer the ability to access Minted by logging in with or connecting via a third party social network or email service, including but not limited to Facebook or Facebook Connect (each, a “Third Party Platform”). If you access the Website via a Third Party Platform we will access and store the information explicitly allowed by such Third Party Platform by their Terms of Service or otherwise, once you allow us to do so, through an interface provided by the Third Party Platform. As we do not have control over the user interface provided by Third Party Platforms, we do not take any responsibility for any changes or problems with the interface or exchange of information provided by any Third Party Platforms.
By accessing Minted via a Third Party Platform, you grant Minted permission to contact you at the email address associated with your account associated with the Third Party Platform. Members of Minted’s marketing lists will occasionally receive information on our products, services, special sales, and our newsletter. You may opt out from receiving these types of information, and you may unsubscribe at any time by changing the settings in your account profile on the Website.  Among other things, registration allows a user to utilize 'saved design' functionality on the Website. Users may customize a virtually unlimited number of stationery items. The text on these saved designs may contain personal information including addresses, contact information, dates of personal events or any other personal information you provide. This information is only available to the registered user and Minted staff. The registered user also has the ability to 'share their saved designs.' This is available so that a customer can allow other people to view or comment on their saved stationery designs. Minted will provide a link to the invitee to view the saved stationery. Saved designs are not publicly available. The customer may also explicitly choose to share a design on a social network or other publishing mechanism. Any designs or personal information shared on third party services are subject to that service’s terms of use and applicable privacy policies.
