The Full Privacy Policy: __
1. What Information Do the Services Collect ?
(a)Information You Choose to Provide to Us
On the Services, you may provide to us personally identifiable information, which is information that can reasonably be used to identify you personally, such as your first and last name, date of birth, email address, and address (“ Personal Information ”). We may collect Personal Information and other information, including demographic information such as gender, age, marital status, education level and occupation, through various forms and in various places on the Services, including account registration forms and “contact-us” forms.
(b)Information Collected as You Access and Use the Services
We and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies that passively collect certain information whenever you use the Services (“ Usage Information ”) via a device or browser used to interact with our Services (a “ Device ”). This Usage Information may include the type of browser and/or platform that you are using, the website or app that referred you to our Services, the areas within our Services that you visit and your activities there, your Device location, your Device characteristics and certain Device data, and the time of day you access our Services, among other information. We may use Usage Information for a variety of purposes, including assessing, enhancing or otherwise improving our Services or our activities in connection with them. In addition, we may collect your IP address or other unique identifiers, or assign one to your Device (each a “ Device Identifier ”), so that our computers can identify the Device. We may access and use Device Identifiers that have already been associated with your Device, and may modify such identifiers to create a new identifier or associate a wholly new identifier with you or your Device. Usage Information may be non-identifying or may be associated with you. To the extent we combine Usage Information with Personal Information (including a Device Identifier), we will treat such combined data as Personal Information under this SEA Privacy Policy.
Some of our Services may collect and transmit precise, real-time information about the location of your Device. For our mobile applications, you are made aware of this at the time you first open the Services with this functionality. Unless it is needed for operation or monetization of the Services, the Services may give you the option to turn location tracking on or off or otherwise manage location services. You can always terminate our location tracking by uninstalling our mobile applications.
We may use various current – and later – developed technologies to collect information about you (“ Tracking Technologies ”). A few of the methods that may be used to collect such data include, without limitation, the following:
Cookies: A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Services (“ Cookies ”). Cookies may be used for many purposes described in our Square Enix, Inc. Cookie Policy, including, without limitation, remembering you and your preferences and tracking your visits to and activities on the Services. Some features of the Services may not function properly if you choose to disable Cookies, and some types of Flash and HTML5 Cookies may not be disabled using browsers. In some instances, especially with respect to mobile, we may require you to uninstall / not use the Services rather than have a poor experience from disabling Cookies.
Embedded Scripts: An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Services, such as the links you click on. The code temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third-party service provider is active only while you are connected to the Services, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.
Web Beacons: Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1x1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”) may be included in our Services’ pages and messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a page or email can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Services, to monitor how users navigate the Services, to count how many emails that were sent were actually opened, or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.
ETag, or entity tag: A feature of the cache in browsers, an ETag is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL. If the resource content at that URL ever changes, a new and different ETag is assigned. Used in this manner, ETags are a form of Device Identifier. ETag tracking may generate unique tracking values even where the consumer blocks HTTP, Flash, and HTML5 cookies.
Third parties may use Tracking Technologies with our Services. We may not control those third-party Tracking Technologies and in such event, we are not responsible for them. **However, you consent to potentially encountering third-party Tracking Technologies in connection with the use of our Services, and accept that our representations under this SEA Privacy Policy do not apply to the Tracking Technologies or practices of such third parties ** . This applies even if they share the collected data with us, except that if we combine that data with Personal Information we have collected on the Services, we will treat it as Personal Information under this SEA Privacy Policy.

(c)Information Third Parties Provide about You
We may, from time to time, supplement the information we collect directly from you on our Services with outside records from third parties for various purposes, including to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor content and ads to you, and to offer you opportunities that may be of interest to you. To the extent we combine such information we receive from those sources with your Personal Information we collect on the Services, it will be treated as Personal Information and we will apply this SEA Privacy Policy to such combined information. In no other circumstances do our representations under this SEA Privacy Policy apply to information we receive about you from third parties, even if they have used our technology to collect it and share it with us.
(d)Information from Interacting with Third-Party Locations
The Services may include functionality that allows certain kinds of interactions between the Services and your account on a third-party web site or application. Here are two examples:
(1) Login: We may provide an option to use your Facebook, Google or other account provided by a third-party site or application to facilitate the registration and login or transaction process on the Services. If you choose to use such options to access our Services, the third-party site or application may send Personal Information about you to the Services. If so, we will then treat it as Personal Information under this SEA Privacy Policy.
(2) Social Communication: You can also engage with our content on or through third-party social networking sites, such as Facebook and Twitter (or third-party social media plug-ins and applications). When you engage with our content on or through third-party social networking sites, plug-ins and applications, you may allow us to have access to certain information from your social media profile (e.g., name, email address, photo, gender, birthday, location, your list of friends, people you follow and/or who follow you, the posts or the ‘likes’ you make) to deliver the content or as part of the operation of the application. When you provide information from your social media account, it can help enable us to do things like (1) give you exclusive content, (2) personalize your online experience with us within and outside our Services, and (3) contact you or advertise to you through the social networking sites or directly by sending you the latest news, special offerings, and rewards. By doing so, you consent to the use of the information you provided in accordance with this SEA Privacy Policy. However, please be aware that we may not control or have access to your communications through these third parties, these third parties may retain any information used or provided in any such communications or activities, and these third parties are not subject to this SEA Privacy Policy. You should review the applicable third-party privacy policies before using such third-party tools on our Services, and we are not responsible for these third parties’ practices.
For more information about how social networking sites handle your personal information, please refer to their privacy policies and terms of use.
(e)Information You Provide about a Third Party
You may send someone else a communication from the Services, such as sending an invitation or message to a friend. If so, the information you provide about them (names, email addresses, etc.) is used solely to facilitate the communication and is not used by us for any other marketing purpose unless we obtain consent from that person or we explicitly say otherwise. Please be aware that when you use any “send-to-a-friend” functionality on our Services, your Personal Information may be included in the communication sent to your addressee(s). Some of these tools may be third-party tools subject to third-party privacy policies, as further detailed in Section 1(d) above.

Such disclosures may be carried out without notice to you.

(e)Co-Branded Areas: Certain areas of the Services may be provided to you in association with third parties (“ Co-Branded Areas ”) such as licensors, sponsors or charities and may require you to disclose Personal Information to them.

If you elect to register for their products and/or services, communicate with such third parties or download their content or applications, at Co-Branded Areas, you may be providing your information to both us and the third party.

The Services may contain content that is supplied by a third party, and those third parties may collect your information when you interact with the Services or when web pages from the Services are served to you. In addition, when you are on the Services, you may be directed to other sites or services that are operated and controlled by third parties that we do not control, which may collect your information.

These other sites may associate their Tracking Technologies with you, independently collect data about you, including Personal Information, and may or may not have their own published privacy policies. We encourage you to note when you leave our Services and to review the third-party privacy policies of all third-party locations and exercise caution in connection with them.

7. What about Third-Party Ads and Analytics on the Services ?
The Services may use third parties such as network advertisers and ad exchanges to serve targeted advertisements on the Services based on your behavior on and off of our Services, and may use third-party analytics, user research, or other similar service providers to evaluate and provide us and/or third parties with information about the use of the Services and viewing of ads and of our content. By installing and using our Services, you consent to these practices, including the sharing of data about you with these third parties and their own collection of such data as discussed further below. __ Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements, which may be based on your visits to the Services and other locations you have visited. Third-party ad serving enables us and others to target advertisements to you or people like you for products and services in which you or people like you might be interested. The Services’ third-party ad network providers, the advertisers, the sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may themselves set and access their own Cookies and other Tracking Technologies on your Device and track certain behavioral information regarding users of your Device via a Device Identifier. These third-party Tracking Technologies may be set to, among other things: (a) help deliver advertisements to you or people like you that you or people like you might be interested in; (b) prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times; and (c) understand the usefulness to you of the advertisements that have been delivered to you. You acknowledge and agree that associated technology may access and use your Device and may set or change settings on your Device in connection with the associated operations. Note that any images (or any other parts of content) served by third parties in association with third-party ads or other content may serve as web beacons, which enable third parties to carry out the previously described activities. Third-party Cookies (including flash cookies) and other Tracking Technologies are governed by each third-party’s specific privacy policy, not this one. Our representations regarding our practices in this SEA Privacy Policy do not extend to the practices of these third-party advertisers and others or the use of the information that such third parties collect.
You may exercise choices regarding the use of cookies from Google Analytics by going to https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout or downloading the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.
Please note that we adhere to the  Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising  . You may view our list of third-party service providers, along with your opt-out choices, by visiting our Cookie Policy.
You may choose whether to receive certain interest-based advertising by submitting opt-outs. Some of the advertisers and service providers that perform advertising-related services for us and our partners may participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance (" DAA ") Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. To learn more about how you can exercise certain choices regarding interest-based advertising, visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices, and http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices for information on the DAA’s opt-out program for mobile apps. Some of these companies may also be members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“ NAI ”). To learn more about the NAI and your opt-out options for their members, see http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices. Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt out of certain kinds of interest-based advertising, you may continue to receive other types of ads. Opting out only means that those selected members should no longer deliver certain interest-based advertising to you, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., from other ad networks). We are not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties’ opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.
Note that your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a "Do Not Track" signal to websites and online services you visit. There is no consensus among industry participants as to what "Do Not Track" means in this context. Like many websites and online services, we currently do not alter our practices when we receive a "Do Not Track" signal from a visitor's browser. To find out more about "Do Not Track," you may wish to visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com.
