WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT
We collect both personal information and non-personal information. “Personal information” is any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. “Non-personal information” includes technical information that does not identify an individual personally. Please note that over time, non-personal information may become personal information due to regulatory developments, technological advancements, or the co-mingling of personal and non-personal information. We collect the following information from and about you, and in the following ways:
When you create a Mindworks account, we ask for your name, email address and password. We do not collect payment method details (payment account number and billing address); this is handled by either the Apple App Store or Google Play.
If you sign in to Mindworks using your Facebook, we will use that service to authenticate your identity. We also receive other information that you have agreed may be provided by Facebook such as your username and e-mail address.
When you use Mindworks, information is automatically submitted about the computer, mobile device, or other devices you use to access Mindworks and about how you use Mindworks. We receive data about the meditations you use and the amount of completion or time spent in that meditation. We also receive your browser type, IP address, language, operating system, unique device identifier, the date and time of your visit, the pages you view and the websites you visited immediately before and after visiting Mindworks. In some cases, we link this automatically collected data to other information we collect about you.
Mindworks uses Appsee Analytics Service. Appsee may collect and store certain data about your activity in this app and track touch gestures, scrolling activity and user interaction activity. Mindworks does not use Appsee to collect any of your personal information, nor does it track your activity across applications outside of Mindworks. For more information on Appsee, see their privacy policy. We are using the information collected by Appsee to improve user experience for Mindworks.
We do this to improve the content of the app and Website to provide a more personalized experience. We use this aggregated information to understand and optimize how our site is used, improve our marketing efforts, and provide content and features that are of interest to you.
From time to time we use push notifications in our mobile applications to send you messages about Mindworks or your account. You may opt out of receiving push notifications through your mobile device.
