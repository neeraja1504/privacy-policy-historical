2. THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW IT IS USED
You make the decision whether or not to proceed with any activity that requests personally identifiable information, but please be aware that if you choose not to provide the information requested, you may not be able to complete certain transactions with Skillsoft.
Sometimes, such as when you register for a service or log in to a customer extranet site (such as Client Community), order a product or make other requests or inquiries, we will ask for specific information about you in order to provide that product or service to you or respond to your requests or inquiries. We may collect certain personally identifiable information such as contact information, including name, e-mail address, work and home telephone numbers, fax number and a physical postal address. We may also collect information regarding your personal or professional interests, demographics, past experience with Skillsoft products and services, detailed contact preferences or other personally identifiable information. We may use any information that we collect, including personally identifiable information, to tailor subsequent communications to you, including marketing and promotional communications, to administer and operate the Web Site and our business and to provide and continually improve Skillsoft offerings. We may also share information that we collect, including personally identifiable information, with resellers or other third parties in order to market Skillsoft products and/or services to you. We do, however, provide our users a choice as to whether or not they would like to receive marketing or promotional communications. Please see Section 3, Choice.
Users may from time to time receive up-to-date information on products and services via our e-mail newsletter. Users may opt-out at any time from receiving these communications. Please see Section 3, Choice.
We may also periodically conduct business and individual user surveys because they provide us with important information that helps us to improve our products and services. Participation in such surveys is completely voluntary and you, therefore, have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.
Data you submit online may also be combined with other information you provide through other means of communication, such as postal mail.
As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, referring pages, date/time stamp and click stream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the Web Site, to track users' movements around the Web Site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.
Our Web Site includes social media features, such as the Facebook "Like" button Widgets and the "Share" button. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our Web Site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Web Site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.
We provide online training services to employers and individuals through our Skillport training portal. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected through the Skillport training portal, which is instead governed by a separate Skillport privacy policy found at http://www.skillport.com/skillport_privacy_policy.html.
A SPECIAL NOTE ABOUT TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES
Technologies such as: cookies, beacons, tags, and scripts may be used on the Web Site by Skillsoft and our marketing and analytics partners. These technologies are used for operation of the Web site or service that you request as a user of the Web Site, such as to remember text you may have entered when you navigate back to the page in the same session. We also use technologies to provide optional features and functionality that you may access on the Web Site. For example, a cookie can help us identify whether you have downloaded software in the past so that you won't have to download it again. We use tracking technologies to customize and personalize the Web Site based on preferences you may have expressed either directly by selecting an option or setting or indirectly by your prior use. We also use tracking technologies that collect information about how you use the Web Site to analyze and optimize the performance of the Web Site in order to give you a better user experience. In some cases, particularly with respect to measuring and analyzing performance of the Web Site, tracking technologies may be placed by our third party service providers. We and our third-party marketing and analytics providers may use beacons to help better manage content on the Web Site. Beacons also may be used to understand and monitor online movements of users so that we may better understand and improve their experiences on the Web Site.
We partner with third party ad networks to either display our advertising on our Web Site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partners use cookies, scripts, tags and web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking: http://preferences.truste.com/. European Union users may obtain additional information about online behavioral advertising and how to opt-out by clicking: http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/. Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising, which means that you will continue to receive generic ads.
When you click on a link to an external web site or third party resource (including embedded widgets similar those provided by Facebook and Twitter), the third party may place a cookie from its own site. Skillsoft does not control the dissemination of these cookies. You should check the relevant third party web site for more information about these cookies.
Like other aggregated information from the Web Site that does not identify individual Users, we may analyze and share non-personally identifiable information collected through cookies with Skillsoft subsidiaries, affiliates, and third parties, including our business partners and service providers, and in marketing materials and public disclosures.
Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but, if you prefer, you may take certain steps to control the use of cookies by modifying your browser to reject cookies or to notify you whenever a cookie is sent to your hard drive. You can learn more about cookies and ways to manage them at http://www.allaboutcookies.org/. Please be aware that restricting cookies on the Web Site may impact the functionality and performance of the site.
