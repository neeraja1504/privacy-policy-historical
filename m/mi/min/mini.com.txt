Collection of Personal Information
Within our website, you may be asked to provide personal information about yourself. MINI Canada will collect personal information only when you voluntarily provide it. Be assured that the personal information you provide remains strictly confidential and will be used or disclosed only for the purposes for which it was collected and will not be used or disclosed for any other reason unless you have given us consent to do so.

In certain parts of this website where we require that you provide us with personal information such as credit card information, we will protect the security of your personal information during transmission by using industry standard encryption technology.

Retention of Personal Information
MINI Canada will retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected and to comply with applicable laws.
Use of Facebook Social Plugins
One of the features of the Site is that a user has the ability to engage with social plugins (“plugins”) from the social network facebook.com, which is operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA ("Facebook").
When you access the Facebook social plugin through our Site, your browser establishes a direct connection with the Facebook servers. The content of the plugin (e.g. a “Like” button) is transferred by Facebook directly to your browser, which then integrates it into our Site. The data that your browser sends to Facebook includes your user ID, the website you're visiting, the date and time, and other browser-related information. If you are logged out of Facebook, Facebook does not receive your user ID. You can find more information about Facebook’s privacy practices at http://www.facebook.com/policy.php.
Customer Option To "Opt-Out"
You may decide that you would prefer that we do not use or disclose your personal information for MINI related marketing purposes or as otherwise noted in this Privacy Policy (excepting legal and/or contractual obligations), in particular, for some or all of the following:
− MINI Canada Special Events and Promotions that may include notification of comparison drive events, information for golf, tennis or ski events, new car launches, brochures, etc.
− MINI Retailer Promotions that may include retailer event information, service clinics, etc.
− MINI Magazine Package
− Satisfaction Surveys such as product and/or service surveys, J.D. Power, etc.
− Marketing Surveys such as customer research surveys etc.
If you choose to "opt-out" as outlined above, you will no longer have access to product or service information that may be of value to you. However, if you wish to "opt-out", you may do so at any time by contacting us. Please see above for contact information. Be assured that your decision to "opt-out" will not affect your business relationship with us.
Collection of Non-Identifiable Information
In order to allow you easy and convenient access to our websites, certain non-identifiable information is collected, as described below. We may share this information with our website providers to allow us to continually improve our websites.
Site Traffic Monitoring
During each and every visit to one of our websites, we will collect non-identifiable information by tracking Internet Protocol (IP) addresses on an aggregate basis. IP addresses do not track personal information about you. They simply allow us to monitor how our sites are being used and what information is being accessed. MINI Canada will use this information to ensure its websites remain useful and convenient, in order to meet and satisfy your needs.
"Cookies"
When a user interacts with our website, "session-cookies" are used to collect information anonymously and to track user patterns. They do not permanently record data and are only available during an active session, therefore, once a session is terminated, the "session-cookie" disappears. A session cookie is a small text file which contains a unique identification number that identifies your browser, not you personally, to our computer each time you visit our website. A session cookie can tell us which pages were visited and how often. We use this anonymous information in an effort to improve our website's usefulness to you - primarily for technical reasons, such as providing seamless navigation. If you do not want your browser to accept cookies, you can reset your browser either to notify you when you have received a cookie, or to refuse to accept them altogether. However, if you refuse to accept cookies, you may not be able to use some of the features available on our websites such as personalization features.
Security
At MINI Canada we are committed to protecting the personal information in our possession. A number of security measures are used by MINI Canada to maintain the safety of your personal information. We have implemented security measures which include the use of: physical secure data centres and premises; internal security policies and procedures; defined internal segregation of duties; and electronic access controls such as passwords and encryption technology.
In addition, we encourage you to observe safe computing practices. It is your responsibility to keep confidential the user-ID and password that you use to register with us and not share them with anyone. If you believe that your user-ID and password have been compromised, you can change them by editing your profile at our website www.bmw.ca or by contacting MINI Canada as noted above in "Correcting or Updating Personal Information".
Getting Answers To Your Concerns
MINI Canada has developed policies and procedures to respond to individual complaints and questions relating to privacy. We will investigate and attempt to resolve all complaints. We will respond to your inquiry within 30 days. Please be advised that there may be a reasonable cost associated with your request. Should you have any questions or concerns about our privacy policy please contact our Privacy Officer as noted above.
We welcome your comments and emails but please note that any information, including but not limited to suggestions, ideas or submissions you make through and onto any MINI website will become the exclusive property of MINI Canada.
By visiting our websites you are agreeing to our privacy policy as outlined above. MINI Canada reserves the right to change this Policy from time to time and will provide notice of any significant changes on this website.
