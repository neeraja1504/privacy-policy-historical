Minti - Privacy Policy
The policy below is applicable to all Minti sites and to www.minti.com in general.
Your privacy on the Internet is important to us. We have created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to your privacy. As part of the operations of Minti, we gather certain types of information about Minti users. This Minti Privacy Policy (the "Privacy Policy") explains the types of information we gather, what we do with it and how you may correct or change information that Minti may collect.
Information Collected by Minti
Minti collects two types of information about users: personal information (such as name and e-mail address) and aggregate information (such as information about how many users log on to our sites on a daily basis).
Personal Information
Personal information is collected when users voluntarily register for membership services. Personal information includes e-mail addresses, user registration data, passwords, external homepages, gender, birth date, children and any other user data. We may also receive personal usage and demographic information from third-party partners, and we also collect e-mail addresses from users who send us support mail or request technical or other help. This information enables Minti to improve its sites to make your online visits more productive and enjoyable.
Our site's registration form requires users to, among other information, give us a valid e-mail address. We use customer e-mail addresses from the registration form to inform you of the status of your Member Details Page, comments to articles you are watching or have written, new articles by Members you are watching, new membership benefits and features, to let you know of urgent problems on our site, and to present opportunities that are appropriate to the interests of our community.
Aggregate Information
One method of collecting aggregate information about your activities online (such as the pages you access most frequently or the search terms you enter), and information volunteered by you (such as survey or registration information), is by tracking Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you surf the Web. The computers that deliver the Web pages to you automatically identify your computer by its IP address. When you request a page from one of our sites, our servers log your IP address. Minti sites record IP addresses for the purpose of system administration and to provide aggregate data to third parties. We also use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. In addition, your IP address is used to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information.
Sharing Data with Third Parties
Minti shares aggregate information with third parties for advertising and promotional purposes. Minti may also share personal information with consultants and affiliates for internal business purposes and may divulge personal information if such information is subpoenaed, or if Minti believes that membership has been used to commit unlawful acts, or acts that may endanger the health or safety of another user or of the general public.
Use of Cookies
Minti uses 'cookies' to record information. A cookie is a small data file that Web sites store on your hard drive when you visit them.

Such links may be to advertisers, content providers or partners who may use our logo and/or style as a result of a co-branding or application service provider agreements.
