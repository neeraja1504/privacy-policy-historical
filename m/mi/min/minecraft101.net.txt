These social media, advertising and analytics partners use cookies (small pieces of data saved on your computer) in order to work properly. Each third-party company has its own privacy policy.
Google AdSense
Minecraft 101 uses Google AdSense, a third-party advertising service operated by Google Inc., to serve ads when you visit Yesterland. Google AdSense may use “DoubleClick DART cookie” technology to track information about your visits to Yesterland and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that Google AdSense determines might be of interest to you.

If you would like more information about this practice, and to know your choices about not having this information used in this way, please refer to Google’s policies.

Google Analytics’ reporting is private. Google Analytics may place or read cookies. If you would like more information about cookies for Google Analytics, please see Google’s Privacy statement.
Server logs
As is the usual case on web servers, each web transaction (request for HTML code and images) is recorded in a daily log file. This log file includes information such as your IP address, browser type, and operating system. The log does not include your name, address, email address, or telephone number. The log is used as input to produce reports of website statistics.
Silktide Cookie Consent
The European Union says we need you consent to having cookies laced on your computer. We’ve used a script provided by Silktide to do this, and they of course set a cookie to remember this consent and not bother you so often.
