The Minnesota Government Data Practices Act (Minnesota Statutes Chapter 13) governs all data collected, created, received, maintained or disseminated by the City. This law presumes that all such data is public unless classified otherwise.
There are many exceptions to the presumption that all such data is public. If you are asked to provide private data through the use of an on-line form, you will be given an advisory about the proposed use of the data by the City before you submit the form online.
If you choose to submit information to the City by email, the information you provide, including any identifying information, will be used, disseminated, and retained as needed in conducting the City’s official business and in accordance with the laws governing retention and dissemination of data.
You should be aware of the provisions of the law as it relates to data that you are sending to the City. If you have questions about the classifications of particular information, you may want to contact the City's Data Practices Compliance Official, Craig Steiner at (612) 673-3282.
