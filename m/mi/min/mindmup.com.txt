This information is never stored and discarded instantly after the upload completes.
Analytics: We use analytics extensively for troubleshooting and optimisation purposes. We may record anonymous summary information about actions users perform including the type of action performed, but not the actual textual contents of any changes of changes. (So for example, we may record that you created a new map, but never about what you put into the map). This content is stored using the Amazon Web Services platform.
Payments: We use a third-party payment processor, Stripe. When you submit a payment to MindMup, your payment information data is communicated directly from your browser to Stripe, using HTTPS.

Optional/additional services
Publishing Maps: MindMup allows users to publish maps online using MindMup Atlas. We never publish any information about your maps without your explicit request to publish the content. When you choose to publish a map, regardless of where it was originally stored, MindMup will upload the map contents to Amazon Web Services and make it public. Any maps published to Atlas are subject to MindMup Atlas terms of Service.
Exporting Maps: MindMup allows users to export maps into various content formats such as PDF, PNG and Google Writer. We do not share any contents about your maps without your explicit request to convert the map into a different format, and where remote services are required for conversion, we will warn you first about the map being uploaded remotely. Maps are sent to Amazon Web Services for processing, using HTTPS, and the converted format is kept on the Amazon S3 storage for up to 24 hours so you can retrieve and share it, protected by Amazon S3 authorization mechanisms. This data is automatically discarded after 24 hours. For more technical information on this, see Key information about data security.
