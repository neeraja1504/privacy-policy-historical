Such information may contain names, addresses, email addresses, title, department, location, training materials, training performance data, and includes information recorded on various media as well as electronic data.
MindTickle complies with the Principles with respect to processing Personal Data:
MindTickle generally does not receive personal data directly from individuals. In the event that MindTickle does receive Personal Data directly from individuals, MindTickle shall inform an individual of the purpose for which MindTickle collects and uses their Personal Data and the types of third parties to which MindTickle discloses or may disclose that Personal Data. MindTickle shall provide the individual with the choice and means for limiting the use and disclosure of their Personal Data. Notice will be provided in clear and conspicuous language when individuals are first asked to provide Personal Data to MindTickle, or as soon as practicable thereafter, and in any event before MindTickle uses or discloses the Personal Data for a purpose other than for which it was originally collected. MindTickle may be required to disclose Personal Data in response to lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
MindTickle generally does not receive Personal Data directly from individuals. In the event that MindTickle does receive Personal Data directly from individuals, MindTickle will offer individuals the opportunity to choose (opt out) whether their Personal Data is (1) to be disclosed to a non-Agent third party or (2) to be used for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. For Sensitive Personal Information, MindTickle will give individuals the opportunity to affirmatively or explicitly (opt in) consent to the disclosure of the information to a non-Agent third party or for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. MindTickle shall treat Sensitive Personal Information received from an individual the same as the individual would treat and identify it as Sensitive Personal Information. Agents, technology vendors and/or contractors of MindTickle may have access to an individual’s Personal Data on a need to know basis for the purpose of performing services on behalf of MindTickle or providing or enabling elements of the services.

Accountability for Onward Transfer. MindTickle shall ensure that any third party to which Personal Data may be disclosed subscribes to the Principles or is subject to laws providing the same level of privacy protection as is required by the Principles and agrees in writing to provide an adequate level of privacy protection.
Data Security. MindTickle shall take reasonable steps to protect the Personal Data from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. MindTickle has put in place appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the Personal Data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration or destruction.
