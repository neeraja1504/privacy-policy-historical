As such, the procedures related to the User's credit card and/or any other personal information related to payments will be directly processed by these third-party companies, therefore Moosite, S.L. will have no access to the User's credit card details and/or any other payment systems employed. For such purposes, you are advised to read the service provider's terms and conditions before starting a payment process. Should you not agree to the conditions therein stated, please do not proceed with the payment.
