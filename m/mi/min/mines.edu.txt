Privacy Statement - Privacy
Mines’ Privacy Statement
Colorado School of Mines (“Mines”) is an educational institution located in the United States of America (“USA”). In order to provide you with services and otherwise fulfill our obligations to you, it is necessary for your personal data to be transferred to, and processed in, the USA. Data protection laws differ among  jurisdiction, and the USA may not provide the same level of protection for personal data as your jurisdiction of residence. Mines will take appropriate steps to ensure that your personal data is afforded the same level of protection as described in this Privacy Statement.
OUR COMMITMENT TO INDIVIDUAL PRIVACY
Mines is committed to ensuring the confidentiality of personal data (defined as any information that can identify a person, directly or indirectly, by an identifier) provided to us by our employees, students or visitors. Mines does maintain reasonable security procedures and practices to maintain privacy and security within the university’s operations.
INFORMATION COLLECTED
Mines collects information from individuals or entities when they access the Mines website. Information that is collected from this contact includes the visitor’s IP address, date and time of website access, webpage(s) visited, and time spent on a webpage. In addition, Mines may also collect any information it receives from your web browser, device, and operating system. This information helps Mines understand aggregate uses of Mines’ site, track usage trends, and improve Mines’ services. It is Mines’ policy to collect the least amount of personal data necessary to fulfill the university’s mission, provide its services, and meet any required legal obligations. This policy applies to the collection of all personal data, cookie, log, and device data, regardless of the source or medium.
ACCURACY OF PERSONAL DATA
Mines makes reasonable efforts to ensure that the personal data retained about individuals is accurate. Every faculty member, staff member and student has the ability to check and update certain personal data such as his or her address, phone number, etc. online within Trailhead (Self Service > Personal Information).
For Mines students, questions and requests can be directed to the Registrar’s Office at registrar@mines.edu. For Mines employees, questions and requests can be directed in person to the Office of Human Resources.
SECURITY
The security of your personal data is important to Mines. We have adopted generally accepted industry standards in connection with our data collection, storage, and processing practices and security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of your personal data, and other data stored on Mines’ websites and servers. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commonly acceptable means to protect your personal data, Mines cannot guarantee its absolute security.
CHILDREN
Mines does not direct services to, and does not knowingly collect or solicit personal data directly from children under the age of 13. Some Mines’ webpages present information about activities that are specifically designed for children. However, these webpages are intended to be used only by adults to voluntarily share information online, so that a child who is under the age of 13 can participate in these activities (e.g., summer camps, classes, programs) or so that the adult and/or child can receive information mailed or emailed from Mines (newsletters, class schedules, recruitment information). When a parent or legal guardian voluntarily signs their child up for one of these programs, the parent or legal guardian may be asked to provide:
The child’s full name
Full home mailing address
Phone number
Birth date
School, current grade level
Email address
Parent or legal guardian’s name and email address
The parent or legal guardian supplying the child’s information will be asked to acknowledge that they are, in fact, the parent or guardian who is legally authorized to disclose this information about the child. Any information provided by a parent or legal guardian about their child will not be transferred, disclosed or shared with a third party and will not be used for other purposes.
Parents or legal guardians have the right:
To review personal data that has been recorded by a Mines website about their child,
To refuse to allow further collection of information about their child,
To be given the choice of consenting to the collection and internal use of their child’s personal data, and
To require the deletion of any of their child’s personal data that has been recorded.
See Mines’ Policy on the Protection of Minors here.
DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL DATA TO THIRD PARTIES
We do not rent or sell your personal data to third parties, but Mines may disclose your personal data to third parties it only in the following ways:
With respect to data that constitutes student “education records,” all disclosures are made in accordance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (“FERPA”) and Mines’ FERPA Policy.
To our third party service providers and vendors in order to provide products and services on Mines’ behalf. We ask our service providers and vendors to limit their use of personal data, and generally require that they protect your personal data under written agreements;
As required or permitted by applicable law, if we believe that such disclosure is (a) reasonably necessary to comply with legal process and law enforcement instructions and orders, such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, judicial proceeding, valid requests for university records under the Colorado Open Records Act; and or other legal process served on us, (b) helpful to prevent, investigate, or identify possible wrongdoing in connection with our Services, (c) helpful to protect our rights, reputation, property, or that of our students, visitors, users, corporate affiliates, or the public, (d) in an emergency, to protect Mines and the safety of our students, faculty, and staff or any third party, or (e) to enforce compliance with our agreements and policies with you; and
As otherwise authorized by you.
