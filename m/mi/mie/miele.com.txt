* Cookies
Cookies are small text files that a web site can send to a user's browser for storage on the hard drive. Cookies can make use of the web easier by saving status and preferences about a web site. Generally, websites use cookies to:
* Remind site owners who users are and to access user information in order to deliver a more personalized service, and
* Estimate audience size.
Each browser accessing such a site is given a unique cookie. Information collected by those cookies is sometimes called "click stream" or "click trail" and may also describe pages seen by the user and track user patterns, preferences and length of stay on a particular page.

* Ip Addresses
When a web browser requests a web page or e-mail from another computer on the Internet, it automatically gives that computer the address where it should send the information. This is called an Internet Protocol Address ("IP Address"). We collect IP Addresses through the Site. Those IP Addresses may be used for various purposes, including, but not limited to:
* Diagnose service or technology problems that are associated with the IP Addresses;
* Estimate the number of users visiting the Site;
* Send the most appropriate marketing, advertising or services information; or
* Assist companies or persons who provide information in our service to track visits to their pages.
Top
* Links To Other Sites
We may provide links to external sites as a convenience to you. When you click on any such link, you will leave the Site. The inclusion of any such link does not imply Miele's endorsement of the owner or operator of the external site, the external site itself, or the products or services that the external site describes, promotes or sells. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of external sites. Our privacy policy does not apply to any external site, and Miele is not responsible for the accuracy of any content supplied via any such external site. Should you rely upon that content, or otherwise use it in any way, you do so at your own risk.

* Security And Integrity Of Information
The security of your personally identifiable information is important to us, and we treat our data as assets that must be protected against loss and unauthorized access. We employ reasonable and customary information-security techniques, but no security system is capable of meeting all anticipated or unanticipated security needs. MIELE DOES NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT ITS SECURITY SYSTEMS WILL BE FOOLPROOF OR ABLE TO FULFILL ANY ESSENTIAL PURPOSE, OR THAT YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION WILL BE PROTECTED AGAINST LOSS, MISUSE OR ALTERATION BY THIRD PARTIES.
