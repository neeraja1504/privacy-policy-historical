Middlesex Savings Bank
Protecting consumer privacy is important to Middlesex Savings Bank. The confidentiality and protection of customer information is one of our most fundamental responsibilities and your trust is one of our most important assets. We want you to understand what information we collect and how we use it. In order to provide our customers with a broad range of financial products and services as effectively and conveniently as possible, we use technology to manage and maintain customer information. The following policy serves as a standard for all Middlesex Savings Bank employees for the collection, use, retention, and security of nonpublic personal information.
INFORMATION WE COLLECT
We collect, use, and retain information about you only where we reasonably believe that it will help administer our business or provide valuable products, services, and other opportunities to you. We collect and retain information about you only for specific business purposes. We use information to administer your records, accounts, and funds; to comply with certain laws and regulations; to protect your accounts from fraud and misuse; and to understand your financial needs so that we can provide you with quality products and superior service.
We collect personal and financial information about you from the following sources:
• Information we receive from you on applications and other forms and documents you provide to us (such as your name, address, social security number, assets, liabilities and income)
• Information about your transactions with us (such as your account balance, payment history, and parties to transactions)
• Information we receive from consumer reporting agencies (such as your credit history and creditworthiness)
DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION
We do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about our customers or former customers to anyone, except as permitted by law. It is our policy not to reveal specific information about customer accounts or other personally identifiable data to unaffiliated third parties for their independent use. We may upon inquiry, disclose to the holder of a check, whether or not the relevant checking account contains sufficient available funds to pay such check. We may disclose all of the information we collect, as described above, to nonaffiliated third parties that perform administrative, processing and other account services, to companies that market financial products and services on our behalf, and as otherwise required or permitted by law.
BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS WITH THIRD PARTIES
When the Bank conducts business with vendors and suppliers, we require those vendors to agree to maintain similar standards of conduct regarding the privacy of customer information that is provided to them.
PROTECTION AND CONFIDENTIALITY OF INFORMATION
Middlesex Savings Bank is committed to the security of your information. All of our operational and data processing systems are located in secure environments that are designed to protect your information from being accessed by unauthorized third parties. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with regulatory standards to protect your information.
MAINTENANCE OF ACCOUNT INFORMATION
We continually strive to maintain complete and accurate information about you and your accounts. If you believe that our records contain inaccurate or incomplete information about you, please notify us. We will investigate your concerns and correct any inaccuracies as quickly as possible.
LIMITATIONS ON EMPLOYEE ACCESS
Access to customer information is limited to employees with a business reason to know such information.  Employees are educated on the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of customer information. All Bank employees are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of customer information. Any employee who violates these principles is subject to disciplinary action.
