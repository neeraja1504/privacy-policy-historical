If you purchase a product from us, we request certain personally identifiable information from you on our order form. You must provide contact information (including name, telephone number, email, and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number and its expiration date).
We use this information for billing purposes and to fulfill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you.

If you choose to receive these you should expect weekly HTML newsletter content to arrive at the email address you provided with your purchase.
Karmaloop LLC and our subsidiaries are the sole owner of the information collected on karmaloop.com.
Surveys or Contests
Karmaloop often provides you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you.

The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address).
We use this information to notify contest winners, award prizes, and to send participants our HTML email newsletter.
We sometimes run contests in conjunction with other websites or services. When we do so, any information you provide as a result of entering the contest or survey may also be provided to the affiliate but such practices will always be clearly marked at the time of entry.
