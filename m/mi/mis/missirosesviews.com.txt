I’m the mother of 4 awesome kids…2 girls (ages 22 and 24) and 2 rowdy boys (ages 8 and 12) in addition to my entourage of fur-babies, my adorable Chihuahua, and Cats. I LOVE to travel and stay at fun and interesting destinations as well…Pitch me!

POLICIES
One of the least expensive ways to promote your product/service is by being featured a blog, social media outlets or word of mouth.  If requested, I will review your product/service and an individual blog post will be dedicated to your review and organization. The post may contain photos and/or images. In order to review a product, a
full-size
sample should be provided to me so that I may give an accurate review after use. If for some reason I feel that a positive review should not be given, you will be contacted before the posting and given the choice of publication.
Sponsored blog post : I would love to write a blog post regarding your company or service. This may be in your words or mine, using any specified links, keywords or images. Fees are negotiable.
Advertising opportunities  in the form of banners, text and guest posts are available and rates are negotiable.
