3. What personal data we collect and why
When Users or Visitors use the Service, they may provide, and we may collect Personal Data. Personal data is any information which identifies a person, whether directly (for example name and surname) or indirectly (for example, information about the use of our Services). Visitors and Users may provide us with Personal Data in various ways on the Service. For example, when they register for an Account, use the Service, request that we publish their business listing or send us customer service requests.
We collect the following Personal Data:
3.1 Information provided by Users and Visitors
Contact details provided by the User: Name, surname, email address and (optionally, only if the User voluntarily chooses to provide such information) postal address and telephone number. We may use this information to contact Users about their business listing on our directory, the content (for example reviews or photos) that they posted on the Site, and any other products and services that we may have agreed to provide to them;
Business details provided by the User: Company name, postal address, telephone number, details of the products and/or services offered by the business, at least one category indicating the main economic sector in which the company operates. This information is necessary to publish the business listing in our directory and to provide the best possible service. Users can also choose to provide additional information about the company (for example, opening hours and photos). If they choose to provide this optional information, we will process it for the purposes of publishing the business listing in our directory;
Correspondence: We collect any Personal Data that Visitors and Users may provide if they contact us by email, letter or telephone, in order to provide the best customer support.
3.2 “Automatically Collected" Information
We track the use of the Site through cookies and other similar technologies so that we can provide important features and functionality of the Service, monitor the use of the Site and provide a more personalized experience.
This “automatically collected" information may include IP address or other device address or ID, web browser and/or device type, the web pages or sites visited just before or just after using the Service, the pages or other content the Visitor or User views or interacts with on the Service, and the dates and times of the visit, access, or use of the Service. Please refer to our  Cookie Policy  for more information.
We also may use these technologies to collect information regarding a Visitor or User’s interaction with email messages, such as whether the Visitor or User opens, clicks on, or forwards a message. This information is collected on an aggregate level from all Users and Visitors.
3.3 Information provided by Integrated Services
Visitors and Users may be given the option to access or register for the Service through the use of their username and passwords for certain services provided by third parties (each, an “Integrated Service”), such as through the use of their Google account, or otherwise have the option to authorize an Integrated Service to provide Personal Data or other information to us. By authorizing us to connect with an Integrated Service, Visitors and Users authorize us to access and store their name, email address, age range, gender, country, profile picture URL, and other information that the Integrated Service makes available to us, and to use and disclose it in accordance with this Policy. Visitors and Users should check their privacy settings on each Integrated Service to understand what information that Integrated Service makes available to us, and make changes as appropriate. Visitors and Users should review each Integrated Service’s terms of use and privacy policies carefully before using their services and connecting to our Service.
3.4 Information from Other Sources
We may obtain information, including Personal Data, from third parties and sources other than the Service, such as our partners, advertisers, and Integrated Services. If we combine or associate information from other sources with Personal Data that we collect through the Service, we will treat the combined information as Personal Data in accordance with this Policy.
Information about companies, professionals, associations, when not provided directly by the company and/or professional, is gathered from various public sources, including company websites, professional registers, leaflets, etc. This information is processed for the purposes of publishing the company listings in our directory and providing the best possible service to Users and Visitors.
4. How we use the Personal Data we collect
We use the information that we collect in a variety of ways in providing the Service and operating our business, including the following:
4.1 Operations
We use Personal Data to:
operate, maintain, enhance and provide all features of the Site, and to provide the services and information that Visitors and Users request;
publish the business listing on our directory and provide the Services;
publish the reviews and photos that Users ask us to publish;
confirm the identity and the information that Visitors and Users have provided. We need to confirm identity for security reasons and to safeguard the data in our directory (for example when we process a request to modify a business listing);
remove a business listing, if a User or Visitor tells us to (see the “How to contact us” section).
4.2 Improvements to the Service
We use the information to:
understand and analyze the usage trends and preferences of our Visitors and Users;
improve the Service, and develop new products, services, features, and functionality.
Should this purpose require  MisterWhat  to process Personal Data, then the data will only be used in anonymized or aggregated form.
4.3 Cookies and tracking technologies
We use automatically collected information and other information collected on the Service through cookies and similar technologies to:
personalize our Service, such as remembering a User’s or Visitor’s information so that the User or Visitor will not have to re-enter it during a visit or on subsequent visits;
provide personalized advertisements, content, and information;
monitor and analyze the effectiveness of our marketing activities;
monitor aggregate site usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages viewed.
Please read our  Cookie Policy  for more information.
We also may use tracking technologies to collect information regarding how Visitors or Users interact with the email messages we send, to get information like the time and day they opened our emails and the type of device they used to open them. We use this information to analyze the effectiveness of our email communication in order to improve it and to provide a better and more personalized service.
4.4 Analytics
We use Google Analytics to measure and evaluate access to and traffic on the Public Area of the Site, and create navigation reports for our Site administrators. Google operates independently from us and has its own privacy policy, which we strongly suggest Visitors and Users to review. Google may use the information collected through Google Analytics to evaluate Users' and Visitors’ activity on our Site. For more information, see  Google Analytics Privacy and Data Sharing.
We take measures to protect the technical information collected by our use of Google Analytics. The data collected will only be used on a need to know basis to resolve technical issues, administer the Site and identify visitor preferences; but in this case, the data will be in non-identifiable form. We do not use any of this information to identify Visitors or Users.
4.5 Communications
We use Personal Data to:
communicate with Visitors and Users about our products and services, for example to let them know about major changes to our products or services, to the Terms of Use or to this Privacy Policy;
respond to comments and questions, provide support to Users and Visitors, and improve our customer service;
contact Users with updates on promotions and events, relating to products and services offered by us and by third parties we work with. Users have the ability to opt-out of receiving any promotional communications by managing the notification preferences in their account.
4.6 Enquiries, complaints and disputes
We use Personal Information to help us respond to any enquiries or complaints, or deal with any disputes which may arise while we provide our products and services, in the most effective way.
4.7 Fraud prevention and compliance with legal obligations
Under certain circumstances, we use Personal Data to the extent required in order to enable us to comply with our legal obligations, for example to investigate, detect and prevent fraud. This may require us to provide Personal Data to law enforcement agencies or officials, if they request it.
4.8 Internal training
We may use Personal Data for internal training purposes, so that our staff has the skills needed to provide our Visitors and Users with the best possible experience. For example, if a User or Visitor contacts us by email, we may use their email for training purposes to improve our customer support.
4.9 Market research and analysis
We may use Personal Data to better understand the needs of our Users. We may also invite some Users to take part in surveys or market research. If a User accepts our invitation, we will use the feedback to improve our products and services.
4.10 Internal records and accuracy
Like any company, we process Personal Data to administer and maintain our internal records. For example, we process Personal Data to verify that the information we have about a User is accurate.
5. Legal grounds for processing Personal Data
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) lists several legal grounds for the lawful processing of Personal Data, and requires us to only process Personal Data if we satisfy one or more legal grounds.
We rely on a number of different legal grounds for the processing of Personal Data:
The data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes
In some cases we process Personal Data after obtaining a User’s or Visitor’s consent to do so for the purposes of:
sending marketing communications about our products and services;
sending marketing communications regarding products and services offered by third parties with whom we collaborate;
conducting market analysis and research.
Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party
It is necessary for us to  process Personal Data, and information about the business that a User represents, for the performance of the contract between us and Visitor/User, and to provide the Service.
Data processing is necessary to:
publish a business listing in our directory ;
publish the reviews and photos that a User asks us to publish ;
send communications about the products and services we provide, for example to inform Visitors and Users of major changes to these products or services, the Terms of Use or the Privacy Policy;
confirm a User or Visitor’s identity, and verify the information they provide to us;
provide and improve customer support.
If a Visitor or User chooses not to give some or all the aforementioned information, this may affect our ability to provide our products and services to them.
Processing is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations
Under certain circumstances, we may process Personal Data to comply with our legal obligations, for example to investigate, detect and prevent fraud.
Processing is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests
To consider this as lawful basis for processing, a business must have legitimate interests which are not overridden by individuals' interests, rights or freedoms.
Collecting and processing Personal Data is necessary for our legitimate business interests, which are:
to better understand our Users and Visitors so we can improve our products and services;
to improve and develop our Site to enhance the customer experience;
to provide important features and functionality on our Site, monitor its usage and provide a more personalized experience;
to provide Visitors and Users with products and services that are as useful as possible, for example to inform them of offers that may be of interest to their business;
to train our staff so that they can offer the best customer support;
to respond to any enquiries or complaints, or handle any disputes that might arise while we provide our products and services, in the most effective way;
to manage our business effectively, to comply with our legal obligations, and to be able to exercise, or defend against, legal claims.
We may process Personal Data based on our legitimate interests  except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject.
We have assessed these aspects carefully and, on balance, we believe that our interests described above are balanced with the fundamental interests, rights or freedoms of  the data subjects.
Where we think there is a risk that one of the fundamental interests or freedoms of a Visitor or User may be compromised, we will not process their data unless there is another lawful legal basis for doing so (if we have obtained their consent to the processing or to comply with our legal obligations or if processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with them).
6. Who we share Personal Data with
Except as described in this Policy, we will not intentionally disclose the Personal Data that we collect or store on the Service to third parties without the consent of the applicable Visitor or User. We may disclose information to third parties if a Visitor or User consent to us doing so, as well as in the following circumstances:
6.1 Unrestricted Information
Any information that a User voluntarily chooses to include in a Public Area of the Service, such as a public profile page or business listing, will be available to any Visitor or User who has access to that content.
6.2 Service Providers
We may provide Personal Data to our service providers, who provide us with certain services and act as "processors" of Personal Data on our behalf. These third parties may have access to, or process Personal Data as part of providing those services for us. We limit the information provided to these service providers to that which is reasonably necessary for them to perform their functions.
6.3  Law Enforcement
We may disclose Personal Data:
if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with applicable laws, in response to a facially valid court order, judicial or other government subpoena or warrant, or to otherwise cooperate with law enforcement or other governmental agencies;
to protect the security or integrity of the Service;
to protect our property or other legal rights, enforce our contracts, or protect the rights, property, or safety of others;
to protect ourselves or others from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses or activity;
to investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations.
6.4 Change of Ownership
Information about Users and Visitors, including Personal Data, may be disclosed and otherwise transferred to an acquirer, successor or assignee as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of assets, or similar transaction, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which information is transferred to one or more third parties as one of our business assets and only if the recipient of the Personal Data commits to a Privacy Policy that has terms substantially consistent with this Privacy Policy.
In some cases, the Personal Data we collect for the above purposes may be transferred outside the European Economic Area (EEA), and such destinations may not have laws protecting Personal Data to the same extent as in the European Economic Area. Data protection law requires us to ensure that where we or our "processors" transfer Personal Data outside the European Economic Area, it is processed securely and protected from unauthorized access, loss, destruction, unlawful processing, and any type of processing that is not consistent with the purposes outlined in this Policy.
We will comply with GDPR requirements providing adequate protection for the transfer of personal information outside of the European Economic Area (EEA).
The table below lists the third parties to whom we currently disclose Personal Data. The table also explains how these organizations use Personal Data, if they are our "processors" (they process the data on our behalf, and only in line with our instructions), or if they are "controllers" (they use Personal Data for their own purposes, after receiving them). The table indicates if the treatment is performed outside the EEA, and the safeguards that are used to protect Personal Data if this is the case.
This information may be updated periodically.

If you are under 16 years of age, then please do not use or access the Service at any time or in any manner. If we learn that Personal Data has been collected on the Service from persons under 16 years of age and without verifiable parental consent, then we will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.

We maintain appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss, unauthorized alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, misuse, and any other unlawful form of processing of the Personal Data in our possession. This includes, for example, firewalls, password protection and other access and authentication controls. We use SSL technology to encrypt data during transmission through public internet.
However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that Visitors and Users transmit to us or that is stored on the Service, and Visitors and Users use the Site at their own risk. We also cannot guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.
