Additionally, there may be circumstances under which M/I may be required, by law or order, to provide information it has collected, or M/I may make information available to certain authorized parties when necessary, and as appropriate, in order to protect M/I's proprietary interests from harm due to fraud or other illegal activities.
M/I reserves the right to modify or amend this Privacy Statement at any time and for any reason in order to maintain compliance with applicable laws or to reflect or update changes in M/I's business practices.
