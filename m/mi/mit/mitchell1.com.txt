Privacy Policy Mitchell 1
Mitchell Repair Information Company, LLC (Mitchell 1) Online Privacy Policy
Our Commitment of Privacy
The privacy of your personally-identifiable information is important to us. As part of our commitment to the privacy of your personally-identifiable information, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally-identifiable information may be requested.
The Information We Collect
In general, when you visit our Web site you remain anonymous, but on some pages, you need to provide personally-identifiable information to order products and contact Mitchell 1. The types of personally-identifiable information collected at these pages include:
Name
Company
Customer Number
Address
City
State/Province
Zip Code/Postal Code
Country
Email Address
Phone Number
Fax Number
Credit/Debit Card/Procurement Card Information
The Way We Use Information
We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order to complete that order or to provide a more personalized shopping experience. We do not and will not share this information with third parties other than Mitchell 1′s affiliates except to the extent necessary to complete that order. We maintain credit/debit card/procurement card information only until payment for your order is processed unless you authorize the information to be stored for future visits. If you later decide that you do not want us to store such information, you may contact us at  CustomerSupport@mitchell1.com    and ask us to delete such information.
We also use return email addresses and customer addresses which you provide to us when placing an order or accessing this web site to answer the email and correspondence we receive, confirm your order, send renewal notices, notify you of important changes in the functionality of the web site, update you on new products, and communicate special offers we think you might be interested in. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with third parties. If you do not want to receive this information in the future, please contact us at CustomerSupport@mitchell1.com.
We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our Web site and gather information for product management and development at Mitchell 1. For example, we may tell our sales and marketing staff that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our Web site, or that Y number of software licenses were ordered during a particular time period, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals. This information may also be shared with Mitchell 1 affiliates.
Finally, we will not use or share the personally-identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without first providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.
Our Commitment to Data Security
We have put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
When you place orders or access your account information, we offer the use of a secure server. The secure server software receives encrypted information through the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) of your Internet browser which encrypts the information you input before it is sent to us. Furthermore, we have taken appropriate safeguards to protect customer data against unauthorized access.
We make limited use of cookies on this site. ”Cookies” are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer’s hard drive. The only purpose for which we use cookies is to keep track of items ordered during your current shopping session in our Product Catalog. This is necessary to facilitate a streamlined checkout process.
Our Commitment to Children’s Privacy
Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our Web site from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our Web site is structured to attract anyone under 13. Any parent or guardian that learns that their child may have submitted personally-identifiable information should contact us immediately at  CustomerSupport@mitchell1.com  .
How You Can Access or Correct Your Information
