Do Not Track Disclosure
"Do Not Track" ("DNT") refers to an HTTP header used by Internet web browsers to request a web application disable its tracking or cross-site user tracking.

Some U.S. state laws require us to disclose how we respond to web browser DNT signals. We do not respond to or take any action with respect to a DNT configuration set in your internet browser, and therefore, do not disable tracking. For data about Do Not Track, visit www.allaboutdnt.org.
