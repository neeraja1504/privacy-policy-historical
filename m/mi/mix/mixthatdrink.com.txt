Privacy | Mix That Drink
Your privacy is critically important to us. At MixThatDrink we have a few fundamental principles:
We don’t ask you for personal information. Period.
If you volunteer personal information (say, you email us, so now we have your email address) we don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law or protect our rights.
We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services. (We’re mainly talking about IP addresses, data about your browser and/or devices, and any email address you use to access the site.)
We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what’s visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.
If you have any questions, please use the Contact Form.
Routine logging
Like most websites, MixThatDrink automatically collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, IP address, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. We do this in order to better understand how our visitors use our website. MixThatDrink may occasionally release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
MixThatDrink also collects potentially personally-identifying information such as the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses of visitors. MixThatDrink needs this information in order to diagnose and troubleshoot problems with the site; to better understand its visitors and how they use our website; and, when necessary, to block abusive visitors such as spammers or malware distributors. This information is shared with our analytics software providers, Google Analytics and Clicky. Please review How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services. IP addresses are visible to site administrators when you leave a comment and in our analytics software. MixThatDrink uses Clicky Web Analytics to log and analyze the traffic to our web site. You may review Clicky’s privacy policy here. A “Unique ID” tracking cookie is used for the “legitimate purpose” of identifying unique visitors, but otherwise no “personal data” is logged.
MixThatDrink does not share any of the foregoing information with anyone except to comply with the law or protect our rights.
Submitted Personal Information
If you leave a blog comment on MixThatDrink, you will be required to share an email address and IP address with us. This information will not be visible on the site. Site administrators will be able to see it. This information is stored in our database. You may use a SpamGourmet temporary email address so that MixThatDrink will never see your real email address.
Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
MixThatDrink discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on MixThatDrink’s behalf or to provide services available at MixThatDrink’s website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using MixThatDrink’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. MixThatDrink will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations, as described above, MixThatDrink discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when MixThatDrink believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of MixThatDrink, third parties or the public at large. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. MixThatDrink takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
We also may be required to disclose an individual’s personal information in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
MixThatDrink acknowledges that all individuals have the right to access the personal information/data that we maintain about them. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data, should direct his query to mixy[at]mixthatdrink[dot]com. If requested to remove data, we will respond within a reasonable timeframe, not to exceed one week.
