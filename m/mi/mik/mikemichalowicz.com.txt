We are continually adapting to changes in technology to bring you the information you rely on faster and more efficiently than ever before.
TPE publishes this Privacy Policy to reaffirm our commitment to maintaining the privacy of our customers in the electronic environment and inform you of our practices concerning the collection and use of information you provide us.

What information we collect
How we collect the information
How we use the information
How we provide choice to Users about how we use the information we collect
Whether we disclose the information we collect to third parties
Whether third parties collect information through our Products
TPE reserves the right to make changes to any part of this Privacy Policy in its sole discretion, at any time and without prior notice. Continued use of any Product following any such change will constitute acceptance of those changes. If we decide to revise this Privacy Policy, we will post changes in the Products so Users are aware of our information practices. To continue to stay informed about this important issue, please check this Privacy Policy frequently.
This Privacy Policy applies to all Customers and Users (collectively referred to as �Users�). In addition, this Privacy Policy applies to all Products.
To make this Privacy Policy as easy to read as possible, TPE has simplified certain sentences by substituting defined terms for certain concepts. Accordingly, the capitalized terms used throughout this Privacy Policy shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in Section 8 (�Definitions�) of this Privacy Policy.
2. TPE's Privacy Pledge. TPE makes the following pledge to you:
TPE is committed to protecting the privacy of Users at all times.
TPE only shares Customer Information and other Personally Identifiable Information with third parties as described in Sections 5 and 7 in this Privacy Policy.
TPE maintains security standards and procedures designed to protect Customer Information and other Personally Identifiable Information. We will continue to test and update our technology to improve our ability to protect Customer Information and other Personally Identifiable Information.
3. Consent To Use Information. By using any Product and/or by affirmatively accepting the License Agreement or this Privacy Policy, each User consents to the collection and use of all information that the User provides to TPE, all information that is provided to TPE on behalf of that User, and all information that TPE collects based on that User's use of the Products, including, without limitation, all Customer Information and other Personally Identifiable Information.
4. Our Policies Regarding the Collection of Information. At TPE, our goal is to provide Users with quality information, products, and services. We are also committed to providing Users with responsive, personalized service, and keeping Users informed about new information, products, and services that may be of immediate interest to Users or that can help Users derive the greatest value from the Products.
Customer Information is at the heart of our ability to provide superior service to Users. We describe in this Privacy Policy the types of Customer Information and other Personally Identifiable Information that we collect, and how and why we may share that Customer Information and other Personally Identifiable Information with others.
A visitor who browses the TPE Web site is not required to reveal any Personally Identifiable Information, such as name, address, or telephone number, unless subscribing to a product. Nor is such information collected passively by electronic means. TPE Web servers collect other information such as the make of a visitor's browser software and the Internet domain name of the location from which the visitor enters. This information helps us diagnose technical problems and manage our sites by tracking user interests.
The primary reason that we collect and maintain Customer Information and other Personally Identifiable Information is to serve Users and administer our customer relationships. TPE may collect Customer Information and other Personally Identifiable Information from a variety of sources, such as the following:
Information Users provide to us, such as information Users provide to us in the registration process.
Information we receive from a Customer that purchases Subscriptions for Users, such as registration information.
Information about transactions by Users as part of the Products or other User experiences with TPE, such as the information we receive when a User submits a question through a search box in a Product. We collect Customer Information and other Personally Identifiable Information in a number of ways, such as the following:
Registration Process:
- In order to use our Products, each User may be asked to complete a registration process, which requires providing certain registration information to TPE.
Credit Cards:
- We collect credit card information for billing purposes. For convenience of our customers, we do not store, use, or share credit card information for any other purpose
Log Files:
- We track information about each User's usage of the Products in log files. We use this information as follows:
+ To analyze trends
+ To administer the Products
+ To track statistical information about how Users
+ use the Products
+ To gather broad demographic information for aggregate use
- TPE does link information regarding a User's usage of the Products to the User's Personally Identifiable Information
Cookies:
- Use of Cookies Generally:
+ A cookie is a piece of data stored by each User's browser that contains information about the user of a computer. Cookies help Web sites recognize return visitors. When you return to a Web site you visited before and that Web site uses cookies, your browser gives this data back to the Web site's server.
+ Contrary to reports about cookies and online privacy, cookies do not contain viruses and most cannot reveal any Personally Identifiable Information about you unless you willingly provide it as a user on a Web site.
+ You will find that cookies are an industry standard and are used at most major Web sites in much the same way we use them here at TPE. You can learn most everything there is to know about cookies at www.cookiecentral.com. We also encourage you to read the privacy policies of all Web sites you visit before you accept cookies from these Web sites.
+ You can set your browser to reject or to accept cookies. You have the option to reject cookies when you are just browsing the Web and accept cookies when you want to use the Products.
- TPE's Use of Cookies:
+ Each Product places a cookie on the hard drive of each User's computer. If a User rejects any cookie offered by a Product, that User may not use the features of the Product.
+ TPE stores your User ID in your cookie.
+ TPE uses your cookie to make your experience with the Products more efficient and effective. For instance, by setting a cookie for a Product on a User's hard drive, the User does not have to log in to the Product more than once, which saves time.
+ Setting cookies also enables TPE to track and target the interests of Users.
- Surveys and Promotional Activities:
+ From time to time TPE may request information from Users via voluntary participation in promotional or market research activities.
+ The information that we request may include contact information (such as name and business address), and demographic information (such as zip code and age level).
5. Our Policies Regarding the Use and Disclosure of Information.
a) Information Use and Sharing. We may use and share the Customer Information and other Personally Identifiable Information that we collect among various departments within TPE and its subsidiaries that perform functions such as servicing User accounts, preparing reports regarding Product use, market research, and promotional activities. The reasons that we share this Customer Information and other Personally Identifiable Information include the following:
To protect Users.
- We use the Customer Information and other Personally Identifiable Information we maintain about Users and their use of the Products, including registration information, as follows:

To provide superior service.
- We use Customer Information and other Personally Identifiable Information to respond quickly and efficiently to User needs.

In such an event, TPE will use reasonable efforts to do the following:
