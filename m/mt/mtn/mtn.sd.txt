What is personal information?  In order to provide you with the services offered on this website, you may be required to provide MTN with personal information. Personal information is information which identifies you as an individual, including but not limited to, your race, age, contact details, any identifying number assigned to you and any information relating to transactions in which you have been involved.
What we collect  On some web pages of this website, you may be requested to provide certain personal information. The types of personal information collected at these pages may include your name, handset details, contact and billing information, and transaction information.
In order to tailor our subsequent communications to you and continuously improve our products and services, we may also ask you to provide us with information regarding your personal or professional interests, demographics, experience with our products and this website, and more detailed contact preferences.
How we use your personal information and how we may contact you
MTN uses your information to better understand your needs and to provide you with better service.
Specifically, MTN will use your personal information to contact you in relation to the goods and services that MTN provides to you.
MTN reserves the right to perform statistical analyses of user behaviour in order to measure interest in and use the various areas of the website, so long as such statistical analyses will not be linked to any registered person by a third party.
Because we don't want you to miss out on any of the deals and promotions that we may have and if it is agreeable to you when you register with us or at any other time, we may use your personal information to contact you for market research.
MTN may send you promotional materials or details by SMS, e-mail or post in order to update you and keep you advised of any promotions, news, competitions or developments which we think may be of interest to you. We will always give you the opportunity to unsubscribe to the receiving of such direct communications.
