9.2  In certain situations, the Company may not be able to provide access to all of the personal information it holds about a customer or employee. The Company shall provide the reasons for denying access upon request. For example:
if doing so would likely reveal personal information about a third party or could reasonably be expected to threaten the life or security of another individual;
if disclosure would reveal confidential commercial information;
if the information is protected by solicitor-client privilege;
if the information was generated in the course of a formal dispute resolution process;
if the information was collected in relation to the investigation of a breach of an agreement or a contravention of a federal or provincial law; or
if the information is prohibitively costly to provide and it is reasonable for the Company to not provide the information on such basis.
9.3  Upon request, the Company shall provide an account of the use and disclosure of personal information and, where reasonably possible, shall state the source of the information. In providing an account of disclosure, the Company shall provide a list of organizations to which it may have disclosed personal information about the individual when it is not possible to provide an actual list.
9.4  In order to safeguard personal information, a customer or employee may be required to provide sufficient identification information to permit the Company to account for the existence, use and disclosure of personal information and to authorize access to the individual’s file. Any such information shall be used only for this purpose.
9.5  The Company shall promptly correct or complete any personal information found to be inaccurate or incomplete.
