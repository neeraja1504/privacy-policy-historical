Privacy Policy | Metblogs
Metroblogging.com’s privacy policy is to respect the privacy of its users.
You are under no obligation to provide personal information in order to use any of our services. For certain areas on Metblogs.com, we collect personal information only when you provide it to us, for example, if you participate in the comments or message boards.
The specific user information collected on Metblogs.com is used only by us. The purpose of collecting such specific information is to enhance the user’s experience. Metblogs.com will never, never, never, never, never, never, never disclose such specific user information unless threatened with jail time or torture based on rapidly decreasing civil liberties, or implementation of “patriotic” laws which are really a sham used by overbearing, power-hungry politicians, in which case there’s a very slim chance we might spill everything we can to cover our own ass. Please see policy stated below about information provided by users in public forums, comments, or chats.
As stated below, Metblogs.com may share aggregate information about its user’s population with third parties.
The Metblogs.com Network encourages parents to actively participate with their children on Metblogs.com, be that by monitoring their usage or flaming them on the comments boards. No persons under the age of 13 or I.Q. of 100 should post any information without their parents or handlers approval and guidance. Additionally, as stated below, we encourage our users to be careful in posting any identifying information in any public forum.
USE OF IP ADDRESSES
When ever you are on the Internet, a number (an IP address) is automatically assigned to your computer. This number is identified and logged automatically whenever you visit our Web site. Collecting IP addresses is standard practice on the Internet, and is done automatically by many Web sites. We have been advised that pointing out that everyone else is doing it is supposed to make us feel OK about doing it ourselves. An IP address does not provide us with any of your personally identifiable information, so although your session will be logged, you will remain anonymous to us.
Some software running on Metblogs.com collects IP addresses for purposes of system administration, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, to audit the use of our site, and probably other things we don’t even know about. When guests request pages from Metblogs.com, our servers log the guests’ IP addresses. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a user’s session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our terms of use or to protect our service, site, customers or others.
USE OF COOKIES
This is not a kitchen so, regretfully, we are not talking about the tasty desert treats. Cookies are pieces of information that a Website transfers to an individual’s computer for record-keeping purposes. Cookies, which are an industry standard used by most Web sites, including ours, can facilitate a user’s ongoing access to and use of a site. Cookies make Web-surfing easier for you by saving your preferences while you’re at our site. We never save passwords or credit card information in cookies. Electronic Cookies do not cause damage to your computer systems or files whereas baked ones, depending on their usage, might.
We use cookies in our discussion areas to eliminate the need to log in every time you use the comments and other message boards on our Web site. You must opt in by selecting “Remember me” in order to use cookies. No cookies will be used without your request. You can set your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. If you aren’t doing this, you should, you’d be surprised as how much crap that web sites try to store on your computer.
You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers. Metblogs.com does not control these cookies. The use of advertising cookies sent by third-party servers is standard in the Internet industry.
AGGREGATED INFORMATION
We collect information through our Web site relating to traffic levels on our Web site – for example, the total number of users visiting particular pages. We also aggregate demographic information and the results of surveys.
This aggregated information, which does not personally identify you, is helpful to us for improving the services we offer and for marketing purposes. We may share aggregated information with our advertisers, business partners, or other companies, and may post it online with the intention of rubbing our kick ass numbers in the faces of lesser trafficked Web Sites.
PUBLIC FORUMS/COMMENTS/CHATS
We make discussion areas and chat forums available to our users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas including your name, e-mail address, or other personal information becomes public information, and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. No matter how enticing the offer sounds, posting your banking info to a message board is never, NEVER a good idea.
And remember – the Internet never forgets : Whatever you post will stay online until the last server fails and the lights go out on planet earth.
LINKS TO THIRD PARTY SITES
Users should be aware that when you are on Metblogs.com, you could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. This includes links from advertisers, sponsors, and partners. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data or solicit personal information. Metblogs.com has no responsibility for these cookies. There are millions of Web Sites on the internet and if you think we are responsible for what goes on on any other Web Site you must be smoking crack.
Please keep in mind that whenever you give out personal information online — for example, via message boards or chat — that information can be collected and used by people you don’t know. We cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online and you do so at your own risk. Don’t be an idiot and you shouldn’t have any problems.
Metblogs.com’s policy does not extend to anything that is inherent in the operation of the Internet and therefore beyond our control, and is not to be applied in any manner contrary to applicable law or governmental regulation.
YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS
By using this site, you signify your assent to Metblogs’ Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use our site. Your continued use of Metblogs.com following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes. If terms are modified a third time, and your usage continues, so will your acceptance of the thirdly modified terms.
