Who are we?
Data Protection Statement Metro Bank PLC. Registered in England and Wales. Company number: 6419578. Registered office: One Southampton Row, London, WC1B 5HA.
The purposes and lawful basis for our collection of personal information
When you sign up for an account with us we process personal information you provide including contact, residency, employment, income and expenditure details, to enable us to provide a range of banking services (contract & pre-contract). Our lawful basis for processing this data is that you are entering into a contract for the performance of services or that we have a legitimate interest to process the information. Those legitimate interests are: enhancing the services that you receive from us, managing and supporting our staff, and effectively managing our own accounts and records.
We process personal information for crime and fraud prevention and the apprehension and prosecution of offenders (law and financial regulation). We make copies of personal identity evidence that are provided to us for our security, identification and verification purposes. Our lawful basis for processing this personal data is our compliance with our legal obligations and, in particular, our Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) obligations. We cannot provide banking services without this personal information.
We may also process your personal information for marketing purposes. You have a right to receive services from us without consenting to marketing communications, and you can always opt out of receiving any such communications from us. Our lawful basis for processing your data is that we have a legitimate interest in making our customers aware of our other services and offerings.
We will explain this further to you at the point of collection by one of our colleagues. For more information please see section 2 of our Terms and Conditions.
The personal information we hold about you is limited to what you have provided us directly, personal information we’ve received from trusted third parties during eligibility checks and the provision of our services to you, or occasionally personal information which is publicly available.
Examples of how we will collect your information include:
Completed application forms and supporting documentation
Correspondence received by us e.g. emails, telephone calls, letters and conversations held with colleagues in store
Online customer account opening
Information provided through social media e.g. Twitter, Youtube
At the end of your relationship with us (for example, if you decide to close your account) we retain your information for as long as required to meet our statutory legal and regulatory requirements. Where retention is based on other reasons we will retain it for no more than 7 years.
Sharing your information
To enable us to process personal information for the above purposes, we must share personal information with Credit Reference Agencies, Law enforcement, HM Revenue & Customs, Fraud detection organisations, UK Financial Regulators, External Auditors & Accountants and other Financial Service Organisations.
The personal information we have collected from you will be shared with fraud prevention agencies who will use it to prevent fraud and money-laundering and to verify your identity. If fraud is detected, you could be refused certain services, finance or employment. Further details of how your information will be used by us and these fraud prevention agencies, and your data protection rights, can be found by clicking on this link.
Our credit checks will be recorded by the Credit Reference Agency, and where we must ask if you are resident for tax purposes in another country, we will notify HMRC of that fact. Where we are requested by law enforcement to help investigate or prevent crime or terrorism, and to meet our legal obligations in this area, we share personal information with law enforcement agencies and other organisations.
We will only share your information where:
The law or UK financial & data regulatory bodies require us to provide it;
HM Revenue & Customs require it;
We are required to detect and prevent crime;
There are other parties connected to your account i.e. joint accounts;
With specific subcontractors who help to provide you with the services you have requested; or
To comply with mandatory Governmental data requirements; or
You have provided your consent;
Joint applications
If you have applied for a joint account, this will mean that both parties will have access to the account at all times. This also means that account holders who submit a request for their information will also be entitled to a copy of the joint account details (excluding identification material).
Where you have provided information regarding the other applicant, you must ensure you do so with their full consent.
Processing personal data outside of the EU (EEA)
We may occasionally send your data to countries (or international organisations) outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) that are deemed to have adequate data protection by the European Commission. In addition, we may transfer personal information to India & the USA. If we do so, we will ensure that the transfer is made pursuant to the model contract clauses published by the European Commission. A copy of the model contract clauses are available on the Standard Contractual Clauses page. In relation to transfers to the US, we may transfer personal information pursuant to the EU-US Privacy Shield.
Instances where we will transfer your data outside of the EU include:
Processing international payments;
Performing identity checks; or
Disclosures to foreign authorities to reduce financial crime and terrorism
How we use credit reference agencies
Recording our calls
Social networking sites
How we use credit reference agencies
As a responsible lender, we do perform automated credit scoring during applications. We do this to ensure an independent, objective and consistent approach is taken to only contracting within the banks risk appetite. Our risk-based lending decision is influenced by this risk profile. We are not obliged to accept an application, and you may contact us to reconsider our decision.
If you apply for one of our accounts or credit with us, we will search your record at companies called credit-reference agencies when considering your application.
We may share your personal information with credit-reference agencies:
To check your identity and verify the accuracy of the data you provide to us;
To assess your creditworthiness and decide if you are eligible for an account, service or facility;
To trace and recover debts;
To manage your account(s) or
To prevent criminal activity, fraud and money laundering
Credit-reference agencies use information from a number of different public sources (for example, the electoral roll, county court judgements and bankruptcies), as well as information from other banks or lenders on how you manage your other banking or credit arrangements.
If you apply for one of our current accounts or credit facilities (not cash account), we may use details of your credit history to assess your ability to meet your financial commitments. Credit-reference agencies will record details of your application and our search will form part of your credit history. They will do this whether or not you go ahead with your application. These details will be seen by other organisations that examine your record. Records relating to one or more of your partners may already be linked to your record and we may consider these ‘associated’ records when considering your application.
If you hold a current account with us, we will regularly update the credit-reference agencies with details of the status of your account including:
The balance of any overdraft;
Details of any defaults;
Changes to your personal information; or
Any special circumstances that apply to your account
