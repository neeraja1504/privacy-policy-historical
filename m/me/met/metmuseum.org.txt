Privacy Policy | The Metropolitan Museum of Art
We welcome your participation on our blogs. An email address is required to post comments. The Museum will not use these email addresses in any way, unless permission to do so is specifically requested and granted. We will not share these email addresses with any third parties for marketing purposes.
The Websites use technologies such as "cookies" and "pixel tags" to improve the functioning of our website and your experience. Cookies are small data files that are automatically sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies enable us to remember what items are in your shopping cart, and to personalize your experience. "Pixel tags" are tiny graphical images embedded in emails or webpages. Pixel tags are used to determine what parts of a website a visitor has viewed, or whether an email was successfully opened. These technologies do not contain any personal information about you; they are used to gather information to analyze traffic to the Websites, to improve our content and navigation, to enhance our marketing efforts, to personalize your experience, and to provide online display advertising, and/or offline advertising, tailored to your interests based on your online behavior.
The Museum also works with third-party analytics and marketing partners who use technologies such as cookies and pixel tags on our behalf. For details, see Third-Party Service Providers.
You may choose to set your browser so that it does not accept cookies. Most areas of the Websites will function without cookies, but cookies are required if you wish to register, sign in, or place items in your shopping bag. For an optimal experience with our site, we recommend that you allow cookies.
The Museum regularly sends email to visitors to the Websites. Email recipients may opt out at any time by following the "unsubscribe" instructions included in the email message. MyMet registrants may subscribe or unsubscribe at any time by changing their email preferences online.
We collect and use the information you provide to personalize the Websites so that we can better meet your needs, fulfill your online order, facilitate customer service, inform you of products and promotional offers, analyze trends and collect statistics. We maintain the data that you provide, along with a record of your transactions, in secure databases. To best serve you, we may combine this information with data that is publicly available and data that we receive from other reputable sources. Our collection and use of visitor information varies with the type of visit or transaction. For details about each transaction type, see When You Register, When You Make a Donation or Purchase a Membership, When You Shop in The Met Store, When You Purchase Tickets to an Event, or When You Complete a Survey. Your privacy rights allow you to exclude your personally identifiable information (to "opt-out") from disclosure to third parties for marketing purposes.
The Museum occasionally asks for feedback and publishes surveys on the Websites or through a reputable third-party service provider. Your participation in these surveys is on a voluntary and anonymous basis, unless otherwise specified. We use the survey responses to improve our understanding of you, our visitors, and to determine how best to serve your needs. Information collected in these surveys is never sold, rented, or shared with third parties for marketing purposes.
The Museum will ask you to provide personal information that is necessary to process and service your donation or Membership online, which may include your name, billing and shipping addresses, telephone number, email address, and credit card number. Your credit card information will be temporarily stored on a secure server and used only for processing your online transaction. We will retain the information you provided for our records, and to facilitate customer service.
We may share the names and postal addresses we receive from Members, Patrons, and donors with other organizations for marketing purposes. If you do not want to have your information used in this way, you may send an e-mail message containing your name and postal address to membership@metmuseum.org.
We may also share such information with third-party vendors who help us analyze and understand our donor and membership base.
In certain cases, you may be asked for additional information required to complete and service your request, such as the names of your children when joining The Met Family Circle. (See Children Under Thirteen Years of Age.)
The Museum will ask you to provide personal information necessary to fulfill your online ticket order or brochure request, which may include your name, billing and shipping addresses, telephone number, and credit card number.

For online ticket orders or brochure requests, we also require your email address so that you can receive order, shipping, event, or other transaction-related emails, and so that we can communicate with you if we have difficulty processing your ticket order or request. When you purchase tickets, your credit card information will be stored temporarily on a secure server, and we will retain the personal information you provided with your order for our records, to facilitate customer service, and to inform you of Museum-related programs and offerings.
When you purchase tickets or request a brochure, we may share the information you provide, such as your name and your postal address, with other reputable organizations and companies whose programs and services might interest you.
