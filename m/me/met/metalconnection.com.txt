Online purchase of products/services
Orders for AAHA products and services, including books, brochures, videos, magazine subscriptions, and meeting registrations, can be placed through the AAHAnet.org website. These online transactions are made via a secure server that utilizes data encryption. Purchasing information, including email addresses, is not shared with any third parties.

Membership applications
Applications for AAHA membership can be submitted through the AAHAnet.org website. These transactions are made via a secure server that utilizes data encryption.
AAHA occasionally rents the list of member names and postal addresses to third parties. Prior to renting these lists, AAHA approves all promotional mailings from third parties to ensure the information is applicable and of general interest to AAHA members. The email addresses, phone numbers and fax numbers of AAHA members are not sold to third parties.
Email
AAHA regularly distributes a newsletter via email to AAHA members. The association also may occasionally send email announcements to AAHA members regarding new AAHA products, services and information. These email messages may be sent to website visitors that have provided an email address and have indicated a desire to receive such announcements.
All broadcast e-newsletters and email messages give individuals the ability to "opt out" of receiving similar future AAHA email announcements. Email addresses collected from members and/or through AAHAnet.org are not sold to third parties.
Cookies
AAHA uses cookie technology for certain features of this website. The site includes session cookies for the Members Only and discussion forum sections, as well as for the sections where AAHA products and services are offered for sale. These session cookies are temporary files that self-terminate either when the user closes the web browser, or at an expiration date.
Visitors also have the option to set a permanent cookie, which allows entry to the Members Only section without the input of a username and password. To access the Members Only section, the member's browser must be set to accept cookies.
