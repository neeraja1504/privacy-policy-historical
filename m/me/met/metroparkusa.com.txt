International orders are not guaranteed to ship the next business day because additional verification is often necessary. UPS and the USPS state that most shipments are delivered within 4-5 business days. However, some shipments may take up to 3 weeks to arrive. Please allow time for your package to clear customs. This may take from a couple of days to several weeks.
We are able to ship to countries other than those listed above. Such orders cannot be processed on line, but you may email, fax or phone in your order. We recommend faxing or phoning in your credit card number; for security purposes, email is not advised. Please contact us at  customerservice@METROPARKUSA.com. International shipping fees range from $20 - $135 USD, depending on the country you live in, the shipping service you select, and the weight of your package. If you exchange an item, you will be responsible for shipping charges that apply to the reshipment of the item.
Customs Duties and Other Fees
Please note that shipping charges do not include taxes or duty. The customer is solely responsible for any customs, duties, foreign taxes or other fees that his/her country may impose to take delivery of his/her order. In order to comply with export regulations, we are required by U.S. law to declare the exact value of all items ordered and to mark them as dutiable "merchandise." Declaring less than the true value is both a violation of American law and the laws of most other countries. In addition, we could lose the right to export to your country should it ever be discovered that we were misrepresenting the value. Because we are a retailer, we are prohibited by law from marking your order as "gift," even if the order is intended as a gift by its recipient. Call your local customs office for details about these charges.

We do not refund shipping charges.
