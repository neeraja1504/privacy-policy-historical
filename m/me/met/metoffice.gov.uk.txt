Contact Data
Transaction Data
Device Data
Content Data
Profile Data
Usage Data
Marketing and Communications Data
Location Data
These categories of data are explained further below.
We also collect, use and share aggregated data such as statistical or demographic data to provide us with insight into users experience within the App.  Our analytics helps us understand how our products are being used to help user experience. We also use analytics to identify when there is a problem with the App. For example, we may aggregate your usage data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific App feature. You have the ability within the App to switch your analytics preferences to “off” if you wish.
We do not collect any special categories of personal information about you (this includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health, and genetic and biometric data). Nor do we collect any information about criminal convictions and offences.
How is your personal information collected?
We will collect and process the following data about you:
Information you give us. This is information (including Identity, Contact, and Marketing and Communications Data) you consent to giving us about you. It can include information you provide when you download or register an App, search for an App, enter a competition, promotion or survey, and when you report a problem with an App
If you contact us, we will keep a record of that correspondence
Information we collect about you and your device. With your consent, each time you use our App we will automatically collect personal data including Device, Content and Usage Data. We collect this data using App storage technology
Location Data: We also use device GPS to determine your current location, both for analytics purposes (crash reporting) and to deliver you location-specific weather forecasts. Some of our location-enabled services require your personal information for the feature to work. You can withdraw your consent at any time by disabling Location Data in your settings, or to disable analytics (crash reporting) you can do this in the settings on the App
Unique application numbers. When you want to install or uninstall a service containing a unique application number or when such a service searches for automatic updates, that number and information about your installation, for example, the type of operating system, may be sent to us.
Tracking technologies
We use App data to distinguish you from other users of the App on the distribution platform (Appstore) to remember your preferences. This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you use the App and also allows us to improve the App.
Purposes for which we will use your personal information
To install the App and register you as a new App user (Consent)
To manage our relationship with you including notifying you of changes to the App or any services and to deliver our services (Consent, Contractual Necessity, Legitimate Interests)
To enable you to participate in a prize draw, competition or complete a survey (Consent, Legitimate Interests)
To administer and protect our business and this App including troubleshooting, data analysis and system testing (Legitimate Interests)
To measure and analyse the effectiveness of the advertising we serve you and to monitor trends so we can improve the App (Consent, Legitimate Interests).
To deliver content and advertisements (including personalised advertisements) to you (Consent).
With your consent (provided through the App) we will process your personal information to deliver you adverts more relevant to you (Personalised Advertising). You can withdraw your consent at any time within the App. If you do not consent to this, we will still deliver you advertising but it will be less relevant and does not rely on the collection of your personal information (Non-personalised Advertising). You should also note that you may also see personalised adverts that rely on your consent given through another App not related to the Met Office if that App uses the same platform to deliver adverts as the Met Office.
Although the Met Office cannot directly control your Non-personalised Advertising settings for you, there are some steps that you can take to further control these yourself:
Settings can apply differently across web browser and mobile platforms, if you are accessing Met Office services though the web browser on your mobile device, you should follow the instructions given in our Cookie Policy. However, mobile applications use different technologies to recognise your device. To turn off your App usage data being used to target advertising within apps on your device generally you should follow the instructions below:
