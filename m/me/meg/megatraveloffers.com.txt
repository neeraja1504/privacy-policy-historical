Examples of Personal Information we collect in each case are:

Implicit data capture
In addition to the information which you may volunteer to us, certain Customer Information is automatically collected when you visit the MTO website via tracking technologies employed by us from time to time such as cookies, flash cookies, web bugs, javascript. These collect Customer Information including technical information from your computer whenever you visit the website such as your Internet protocol (IP) address, your operating system and platform, browser type and version and referrer website as well as providing us with information about your shopping preferences, viewed/searched-for products and on site activity. The information collected by cookies and other tracking methods placed by us is anonymous and does not contain your Personal Information but will simply identify you as a specific number by reference to your hard drive. If you are a wireless user and gain Internet access via a mobile phone you should contact your wireless provider to find out if they collect Personal Information about you.
Cookies
Each website owned and operated by the MTO group uses cookies (small text files containing a unique identification number). There are three types of cookies:
Session cookies
These are used to maintain something called session state. If you consider your journey through the website as a conversation with us, this cookie reminds the site where we are in that conversation (for instance, if at some point in the conversation you asked us to add a hotel to your basket, next time you click on the basket it will still be there). Session cookies are required for the website to function but are not used in any way to identify you personally.
Permanent cookies
When you visit our website, we will assign a permanent cookie on the hard drive of your computer. You can view these by looking in the cookies directory of your browser installation. As the name implies, permanent cookies last for a long time and each time you visit our website you send us a copy of them allowing us to identify you from visit to visit. For instance, if you were looking at hotels in London last time you were on the website and the next time you visit us we have a great hotel deal, this cookie enables us to recognise you, so that we can show you that deal. The aim is to enhance your experience whilst on the website and make sure you don’t miss out on great offers. Cookies do not contain any Personal Information for example, your name, address, email address, or telephone number, but simply a unique identification number that identifies your computer to us.
Third party tracking devices
You will see that we carry advertising relating to third parties on our website. This advertising is served either directly by third party advertisers or on their behalf by advertising network companies. These advertisers or advertising networks may place cookies, action tags or other tracking devices on your hard drive to assess the effectiveness of their ads. They may aggregate information about your visits to our website and other websites retrieved via such cookies with other information that you may have provided directly to the relevant advertiser or ad network. This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies and other tracking devices by third parties. This will be covered by that third party’s privacy policies and practice and we would recommend that you take a look at these which in most cases will be found on that company’s website.
Opting out
Although you cannot block "session" cookies as they are required for our website to function correctly you can configure your Internet browser so that it can reject both "permanent" and "third party" cookies. How you do this will depend upon the Internet browser you use (for example, Internet Explorer 5, Netscape 4 or Opera etc). Please refer to the relevant Internet browser manufacturer's website where you should be able to receive all the information you need.
Information from other sources
We may receive information about you from other sources, for example from credit reference agencies to guard against fraud or address, delivery information from third parties engaged for record correction purposes etc.

Such functions include, processing bookings and confirming reservations for products and services and providing associated information (for example, local area information relating to a hotel booking), delivering products and services, processing credit card payments, providing search results, communicating with you, including providing customer service, via telephone, email, post or otherwise and for promotional activities.
We may also share your Customer Information with third parties for the purpose of data analysis, quality assurance (including fraud prevention) and, though this will not include your Personal Information, for marketing assistance (for example, to explore consumer trends).
Various pages on our website contain links (including via ads) to third party websites. Once you have exited our website via such a link, any further data you provide will be collected by or on behalf of the third party responsible for that website and therefore subject to the privacy policy and practices of that third party rather than to this Privacy Policy.

Like any other organisation, from time to time MTO may restructure its business operations by selling one or more of its businesses (or part of a business) to a buyer either within or outside the MTO group. In such transactions, your Customer Information could be transferred as part of the relevant sale. If this is the case, we would contact you to let you know.
Compliance with laws and regulations
We may disclose your Personal Information to third parties, such as official bodies and our professional advisers, as far as we believe necessary (i) to comply with relevant laws, orders or regulations, (ii) to enforce our customer terms and conditions of use or other contractual agreements and (iii) to protect the property and other rights of MTO, its group companies, customers and others (for example, in any way relating to protection against fraudulent activities in respect of MTO).
