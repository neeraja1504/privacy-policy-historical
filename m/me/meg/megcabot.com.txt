Indirect Collection of PII: We may also collect information from you passively through the use of cookies. Cookies are small bits of information that the operators of Internet sites place on the hard drive of your computer. Cookies remember information about your activities on the site and enable the operator of the site to make your visits to our website more enjoyable. At this time, MegCabot.com employs cookies to identify each user as a unique visitor, so that we can determine if you are a new or returning user.

Also, you can program your computer to warn you each time a cookie is being sent or to refuse cookies completely.

When you give us information for a specific purpose, we will use that information solely for that purpose unless we tell you otherwise and give you an opportunity to “opt out.”

CHILDREN’S PRIVACY POLICY
COLLECTION, USE, DISCLOSURE AND SECURITY OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION (“PII”) AT MegCabot.com FOR CHILDREN UNDER AGE 13
Kids and Internet Safety: We at MegCabot.com understand that the Internet presents an opportunity for us to reach the public in new and exciting ways with information about our programming, fun games, exciting sweepstakes and contests, email, chat rooms, message boards, and other forms of interactivity. MegCabot.com also recognizes the privacy concerns of parents and the importance of protecting the privacy of the information we collect from children on our website. Parents of children can be confident that any personal information that may be provided to our website will be collected, used and maintained in accordance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”). MegCabot.com encourages parents to supervise their children’s activities online and to participate with their children’s online activities whenever possible. However, we understand that parents may not always be able to supervise their children’s activities on the Internet. That’s why we have developed a website that parents can feel are safe for their children and kids will find cool, informative, educational, and fun! Because there’s always room for improvement, we welcome any suggestions on how to make the website a better, safer place to hang out.
Collection of PII from Children Under 13: When a visitor to our website is under the age of 13, we do not require the disclosure of more PII than is reasonably necessary for her or him to participate in an activity as a condition of such participation. We collect from children under age 13 no more than names, and email addresses, depending on reasonable need. We do this in connection with submissions of suggestions and content and requests for information. Children under 13 are not allowed to use our message boards. With very few exceptions—described further below—we do not store PII from a child below the age of 13. (For simplicity, our further references to “parents” are intended to include “legal guardians” as well.) These procedures are discussed further below.
Our General Practice Regarding Parental Consent:
We may collect the child’s email address in order to respond to a message. After the response, the email message and email address will be deleted and no record will be kept.
A child under 13 years of age may create a message board account by misrepresenting their age, or may enter a contest that is intended for visitors who are 13 and older. All contest entries are deleted at the end of the contest period and are not stored. Message board accounts of users who are under the age of 13 are deleted upon discovery.
EXCEPTIONS TO Our General Practice Regarding Parental Consent : We may collect a child’s name and email address to the extent reasonably necessary to protect the security or integrity of the website; to take precautions against liability; to respond to judicial process; or, to the extent permitted under law, to provide information to law enforcement agencies or for an investigation on a matter related to public safety. In each of these cases, the information will not be used to recontact the child or for any other purpose, and will not be disclosed on the website.
Means for Parents to Review PII of their Children and Revoke Consent
Parents may request at any time to review their child’s personal information, to delete it, to refuse to permit further collection or use of the child’s information, and/or to revoke any consent. Parents should direct their requests to Meg Cabot, P.O. Box 4904, Key West, FL 33041-4904 or Admin@MegCabot.com.
Upon request from a parent:
We will give the parent the opportunity to review the PII provided by his or her child if the parent is able to show that he or she is the parent of that child, by sending reasonable proof via postal mail or by fax.
We will give the parent a description of the general types or categories of personal information collected from children by us.
We will give the parent the opportunity to refuse to permit our further use or future online collection of PII from the parent’s child and to request our deletion of the child’s personal information.
If a parent refuses to permit further collection or use of the child’s information, and/or revoke consent, then we will immediately comply and delete all information relating to that child in our database. However, we will continue to permit the child to participate in activities at the website that do not require personal information, and we will only terminate a service provided to the child if the information in question is reasonably necessary for the child’s participation.
