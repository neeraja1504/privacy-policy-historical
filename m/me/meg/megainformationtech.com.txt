Privacy Policy
Privacy Statement
Mega Information Technology Limited Corp. is committed to safeguarding your privacy online. Please read the following policy to understand how your personal information will be treated as you make full use of our offerings. This policy may change from time to time so please check back periodically. This Privacy Statement only covers the site Mega.
Aggregated Information
Aggregated information, such as which page users access or visit and information volunteered by users, is collected through various methods. For example, Mega collects IP addresses. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the web. Web servers (the computers that "serve up" web pages) automatically identify your computer by its IP address, and when you request a page from Mega, our servers log your IP address. Mega only uses IP addresses for the purposes of web traffic analysis and trends.
Use of Cookies
Mega also uses cookies to store information. A cookie is a small data file that most major web sites write to your hard drive for record keeping purposes when you visit them. Cookies allow Mega to measure activity on the site and to improve your user experience, for example by remembering your passwords and viewing preferences.
