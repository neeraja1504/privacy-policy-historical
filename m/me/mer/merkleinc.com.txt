Source and Use of Information. Merkle provides the framework for organizations to apply database marketing strategies to their marketing programs across mass, direct and digital media. Using a variety of quantitative, information-based solutions, Merkle works with clients to plan, design, execute and measure fully integrated customer relationship marketing (CRM) solutions that allow our clients to market products and services more effectively.
Information is at the core of Merkle’s business. Merkle obtains marketing information (including information about consumers and businesses) from and through our clients. Merkle also acquires marketing information from third parties to be used by our clients. Many of our client solutions involve various uses of information, including the storage, exchange, transfer, management, analysis and/or reporting of such information. Merkle does not collect data directly from consumers except for information collected as part of our clients’ marketing programs,
Privacy Philosophy.  Merkle is committed to ensuring that the information provided by clients and third parties is secure while in our care and will be used responsibly. Like our clients, we recognize that the privacy of consumers is paramount in our business, so we continuously seek ways to protect and ensure appropriate use of information related to consumers while promoting policies within the industry that do the same.
Our philosophy around consumer privacy and information security is derived in part from a core objective – earn and maintain our clients’ trust to use information in a way that benefits both businesses and individuals, while protecting the privacy of consumers. Our objective is premised on the beliefs that:
The use of marketing information is beneficial to consumers and ultimately provides more effective marketing communications, products and services to consumers.
Marketing information and data should only be used to benefit consumers and their ability to form mutually beneficial relationships with marketers (i.e., our clients).
Consumers should be provided with notice, choice and education about the use of personal information, and consumer preferences and requests should be honored as they relate to marketing data and information.
The enforcement of opt-in and opt-out processes is essential to meet consumer preference and choice.
Opting Out of Direct Mail and Telemarketing.  Responsible marketing companies respect your choice to not receive direct mail advertising.  Merkle uses Direct Marketing Association (DMA) resources to suppress the names and addresses of individuals who have notified the DMA that they do not want to receive advertising by mail.
If you would like to opt out of direct mail advertising, send your complete name and address to:  DMA Mail Preference Service  P.O. Box 643  Carmel, NY 10512
Responsible marketing companies respect your choice to not receive telemarketing calls. Merkle uses DMA resources to suppress the phone numbers of individuals who have notified the DMA that they do not want to receive telemarketing calls.
