Merschat.com does not collect or use personal information of our visitors in any way other than site functionality. It's by-design that most areas of our functions do not require a login. This is so users are certain that we won't sell their email addresses to mail lists, etc. And where logins or email interaction are required (such as with eCards or the Quality Information System), our same policy applies. All user information is kept strictly confidential and not shared with other entities in any way.
