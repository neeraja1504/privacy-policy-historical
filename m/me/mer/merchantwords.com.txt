COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES
We and our service providers use cookies in connection with our Services. A cookie is a small data file that is stored on your computer’s or mobile device's memory. Some cookies help you navigate our Services, including setting a cookie to remember your login details. Cookies also help us better understand the effectiveness of our Services and to highlight areas we can improve (for example, by tracking the way in which you respond to, select and interact with our Services, by allowing us to evaluate aggregate usage and web traffic routing on our Services). If you submit an inquiry through our Service and provide your name and email and similar information, that personal information will not be tied back to you for interest-based advertising purposes across websites and applications, however, you may receive email marketing communications from us, and you may received interest-based advertising from third parties based on cookies dropped on your device by our third party service providers.  To opt out of marketing communications and interest-based advertising by third parties, see “ Choices.”
We and our service providers may also use "pixel tags," "web beacons", "clear GIFs" or similar means (individually or collectively "Pixel Tags") to analyze usage patterns of consumers. A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel, which is typically a transparent graphic image (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel) that is placed on a web page or in a mobile application and may be associated with cookies on your hard drive. Some Pixel Tags are used to drop cookies on users’ devices. Pixel Tags allow us to count users who have visited our Services and pages within our Services, and to help determine the effectiveness of our Services.
Third parties may use cookies or similar technologies on visitors of our Services to serve interest-based advertisements to such visitors when they visit other websites and mobile applications. The collection of information through cookies or similar technologies by such third parties will be governed by such third parties’ own privacy policies and principles, which MerchantWords does not control.

To read about your choices with regard to MerchantWord’s and third parties’ uses of cookies in our Services, please see “ Choices.”
We do not track users when they cross to third party websites, and we do not provide targeted advertising to them, and therefore we do not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals.
LEGAL BASIS RELIED ON FOR PROCESSING PERSONAL INFORMATION OF EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA INDIVIDUALS
MerchantWords is a data controller with respect to the personal data collected or received by us (such as email address and credit card numbers) through our Services.  In this case, the data controller is Merchant Words, LLC.  Depending on the data processed, we rely on various legal bases for the processing. We may process personal information (such as your email address and credit card number) with your consent or to fulfill our obligations under our contract with you, such as our obligation to give you access to our Services that you paid for and to process payment.  On certain occasions, we may also rely on the consent of the individual to process personal information (for example, in some jurisdictions, when the user inputs personal information into the Services and consents to receive marketing communications). On other occasions we may rely on legitimate interest as a basis for processing, when it is in our legitimate interests to do so and when these interests are not overridden by the individual’s data protection rights. Those legitimate interests include performing our obligations with respect to providing the Services and improving our Services.
RETENTION
We will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law, or an individual requests deletion in accordance with applicable law.  See “ Access and Rights regarding Personal Information.”

INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION TRANSFERS AND MODEL CLAUSES
Please be aware that the information we collect may be transferred to and maintained on servers or databases located outside your state, province, country, or other jurisdiction, where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your location. Please be advised that we process and store information in any country where we have facilities and/or employees, including the United States, or in which we engage service providers (for example, payment providers who charge your credit card for our services or vendors who provide us with cloud storage services or other vendors who provide email management services or customer service).

In each case, we ask our service providers to transfer and process the personal information in accordance with the requirements of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
