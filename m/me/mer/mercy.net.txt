Except as disclosed in this Website Privacy Policy Statement, Mercy does not collect any identifiable information about visitors to this site or our customers who use this site. The policies, sources and uses of information are outlined in the sections that follow:
Web Log Files
We collect and log the IP address of each visitor to gather aggregate data on visitors to our site and how our site is being used. We do not associate IP addresses with any personally identifiable information. These logs may contain: the Internet domain from which you access the site (such as aol.com; abc.org; etc.); the IP address which is automatically assigned to your computer when you get on the Internet (a static IP address may be identifiable as being connected to you, while a dynamic address is usually not identifiable); the type of browser and operating system you use; the date and time you visited the site; the pages you viewed on the site; and, the address of the website you linked from, if any.

We use survey information for research and quality improvement purposes, including helping Mercy to improve information and services offered through the website. In addition, users giving feedback may be individually contacted for follow-up due to concerns raised during the course of such evaluation. Demographic information and web log data may be stored for future research and evaluation.
