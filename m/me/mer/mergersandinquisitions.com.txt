Marketing funnel providers.

These third parties have signed contract with us in which they are prohibited from utilizing, sharing, or retaining your personal data for any purpose other than we dictate.
E) Cookies and Similar Technologies
A cookie is a very small text document that often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a website, that site’s computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies.
Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser’s preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites.
Our sites use cookies and similar technologies to track particular aspects of you and other people who visit us.
For example, we use Google Analytics to track data such as time spent on site, the most popular pages, and the most common keywords used to find our sites. We retain user data for 26 months in Google Analytics, which is the default policy.
This tracking is done to provide us with information on how people use the sites, what is of interest to them and what is not, how our marketing is performing, and incidental items such as the percentage of users who access the site from a personal computer versus a mobile phone.
We also use cookies for remarketing purposes in conjunction with outside services such as Google Adwords and Facebook advertising. For example, if you visited a product page but did not purchase anything, we may display ads for the product via these services.
You may block or delete cookies by adjusting your browser settings or by responding to the cookie consent notice that appears when you visit our sites.
F) How Long Do We Keep Your Data?
We keep your personal data for different periods of time depending on the reason it was gathered in the first place.
1) Comments on the Site. As long as your account remains open and you do not request a cancellation or refund, we retain this data because it is intended to help you complete the courses more effectively and receive answers to your questions. We will not use the data for other purposes. We keep comments on M&I unless you have specifically made a request to delete them.
2) Opt-In to Banker Blueprint or “Free Tutorials” Newsletters. 36 Months.
3) Transactions. Due to U.S. tax/audit requirements, we must retain transaction data indefinitely.
4) Opt-In to Product-Specific Newsletters. 36 Months.
5) BIWS Lesson Completion, Note, Quiz, and Certification Data. As long as your account remains open and you do not request a cancellation or refund, we retain this data because it is intended to help you complete the courses more effectively. We will not use the data for other purposes.
6) BIWS Site Usage Data from FullStory. 2 Months.
If a legal claim arises involving your data, we will store and disclose that data until the matter has resolved.
If you wish to have your data removed from one of the categories in which the holding period is “indefinite” or “as long as your account is open” (items #1, #3, and #5 above), please contact us at accounts@breakingintowallstreet.com and we will process this request for you.
In the case of item #3, Transactions, we must retain the original purchase record, but we will anonymize it by removing your name and billing information.
