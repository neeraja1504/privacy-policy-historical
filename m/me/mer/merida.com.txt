3. for reasons of public interest in the field of public health in accordance to Art. 9 Para. 2 lit. h) and i) as well as Art. 9 Para. 3 GDPR;

5. to assert, exercise or defend legal claims.
(5) RIGHT TO INFORMATION
If you have asserted the right to correction, deletion or restriction to processing with us, we are obligated to inform all recipients, to whom your personal data was disclosed, of this correction or deletion of data or restriction to processing, unless this proves to be impossible or is associated with unreasonable time and expense. You have the right to be informed about these recipients by us.
(6) RIGHT TO DATA TRANSMISSION
You have the right to receive your personal data that you provided to us in a structured, conventional and machine-readable format. In addition, you have the right to transmit these data to another responsible party without impairment by us as the responsible party to whom the personal data was supplied as long as
1. processing is based on consent in accordance to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a) GDPR or Art. 9 Para. 2 lit. a) GDPR or on an agreement in accordance to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR and
2. processing occurs with the aid of an automated procedure.
In exercising this right, you further have the right to ensure that your personal data is transmitted directly by us as the responsible party to another responsible party, as long as this is technologically feasible. Freedoms and rights of other persons may not be impaired by this action.
The right to data transmission shall not apply to processing personal data that is necessary to perform a task, that is in the public interest or occurs as part of exercising public authority that was transferred to us as the responsible party.
(7) RIGHT OF OBJECTION
You have the right to file an objection – for reasons that result from your special situation – to the processing of your personal data, which occurs based on Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. e) or f) GDPR; this also applies to profiling based on these provisions.
We no longer process your personal data unless we can provide compelling and legitimate grounds for processing the data that outweigh your interests, rights and freedoms, or processing the data serves to assert, exercise or defend legal claims.
If your personal data are processed to operate a direct advertising campaign, you have the right to file an objection at any time to the processing of your personal data for the purpose of such advertising; this also applies to profiling as long as it is connected to such direct advertising. If you object to data processing for the purpose of direct advertising, your personal data shall no longer be processed for these purposes.
You have the option, in conjunction with the use of services from an information company – regardless of Directive 2002/58/EU – to exercise your right to object using an automated process for which technical specifications are used.

You have the right to revoke your data privacy declaration of consent at any time. By revoking your consent, the legality of the data processing that has occurred up to the point of your revocation shall not be affected.
(9)   RIGHT TO FILE A COMPLAINT WITH A SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY
Without prejudice to another administrative or legal remedy, you have the right to file a complaint with a supervisory authority, especially in the Member State where you reside, your workplace or the location of the alleged violation if you are of the opinion that the processing of your personal data violates the GDPR.
The supervisory authority to whom the complaint was filed shall inform you, as the claimant, regarding the status and outcome of the complaint, including the option of a legal remedy according to Art. 78 GDPR.
