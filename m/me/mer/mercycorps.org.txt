Privacy Policy | Mercy Corps
We are committed to respecting the privacy rights of all donors and visitors to our website. The following information details Mercy Corps' collection, protection, and use of the data we receive from donors and visitors to this website.
Our General Policy
Mercy Corps recognizes the importance of protecting information we may collect from donors and visitors to our site. We maintain appropriate security measures to keep this information private.
If you choose to give us personal information via the Internet for the purposes of correspondence, processing a donation or subscribing to our email newsletter, then it is our intent to let you know how we will use such information.
Mercy Corps will remove your name from our mailing list, email list or telephone solicitation list at any time, at your request. We will not sell, rent or trade your email address to a third party.
Email Updates
We use a third-party email marketing platform to deliver emails. This company employs techniques for tracking open rates and click-throughs that use email address as an identifier.
You will be given the option to remove your name from our email list at the bottom of each email update. And, again, we will not sell, rent or trade your email address to a third party.
Online Donations
Our online donation processor meets the highest industry standards and guidelines for PCI compliance, utilizing high-grade encryption to ensure secure transactions.
Independent external and internal audits ensure the privacy, security and appropriate processing of your information on our site.

Use of Third-Party Software and Advertising Services
We also use third-party services to better understand the needs of people who visit our site. These services tell us information about technical aspects of our visitors' computers and some demographic information. We use this information to improve our content and structure, leading to a better user experience.
We do not receive or request any personally identifiable information from you unless you provide it.
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click here.
Spam filter
To help us filter out spam we use a service called Honeypot , and Akismet. For more information about those filters, please follow the links to each.
Donations by Mail
In order to increase our base of support and keep our costs low, Mercy Corps sometimes exchanges a segment of our mailing list with other carefully selected organizations. Donors who make their first gift to Mercy Corps in response to an appeal letter may be included on this exchange list; all other donors are automatically excluded from the exchange. All donors who made their first gift to Mercy Corps before January 31, 2004 are also excluded from the exchange. At least once a year, we will inform all donors who are eligible to be included on the exchange list, and give them an opportunity to opt out of future exchanges. Donors who wish to have their names removed from the exchange list can call 1-888-842-0842 or email donorservices@mercycorps.org.
