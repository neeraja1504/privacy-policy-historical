When we disclose your personal information
We may share your personal information with any member of our group, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries, as defined in section 1159 of the English Companies Act 2006.
We may disclose your personal information to third parties:
in the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets;
if MGP or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by it will be one of the transferred assets;
if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our terms of use or terms and conditions of supply and other agreements from time to time; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of MGP, our customers or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction; and/or
where we use analytics database and applications providers and search engine providers that assist us in the improvement and optimisation of our Website, Mobile Application and other sites.
Unless you have provided your consent, we will not disclose information about identifiable individuals to our team partners, team suppliers and/or other advertisers or sponsors, but we may provide them with aggregate information about our users (for example, we may inform them that 200 men aged under 25 have clicked on their advertisement on any given day). We may also use such aggregate information to help advertisers reach the kind of audience they want to target (for example, women located in a particular part of the country). We may make use of the personal data we have collected from you to enable us to comply with our advertisers' or sponsors’ wishes by displaying their advertisement to that target audience.
Other examples of instances where MGP may wish to share your information may include (without limitation):
information provided to shipping companies so that they can deliver products;

information to third party companies who may execute other services on our behalf from time to time.
All of our employees, agencies, partners and suppliers are obliged by us to respect confidentiality.
We may disclose personal information to other parties not listed above if we are required by law to do so.
How we protect and store your personal information
MGP safeguards the security of the data you send us with physical, electronic and managerial procedures. MGP requests that you take reasonable steps to safeguard and protect your own personal data when you are on the internet. Change passwords often, use a combination of letters and numbers and make sure that you use a secure browser.
The web server may automatically record your IP address and the date and length of time you spent on our Website, and other sites, including as detailed in the “Information we collect about you” sections above.
The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ('EEA'). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers or partners. Such staff maybe engaged in, among other things, management of our fan database, the fulfilment of any order made by you, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our Website, and other sites; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.
Links to other sites
MGP will endeavour to only provide links to other sites that are from a trustworthy source. However, once you leave the Website or other sites we control, you should be aware and take note that we have no control over any other website. We cannot, therefore, be responsible for the protection of privacy of any information, that you provide on any other website. Those websites, including, without limitation, those of MGP’s webstore operator, will not be governed by this Policy. If you use any of the links provided to you from our site, you should read their applicable privacy statement before you submit any personal data to these websites.
Social Plugins
MGP uses social plugins of social networks such as: Facebook, Google+, Twitter and Instagram ('Buttons').
When you visit the Website, these Buttons will be deactivated by default. To activate these Buttons you must click on them. Once they have been clicked they will remain active until they are deactivated by you or you delete your cookies.
When the Button is activated, the social network can extract data independently, whether you interact with the Button or not. If you are logged on to a social network, the network can assign your visit to the Website, or our other sites, to your user social network account.
MGP has no control on the data retrieved by social networking websites and you must consult their relevant social network privacy policy, or data protection policy, to find out how they use your data. For the avoidance of doubt this Policy only relates to the Website and other channels, networks, mobile applications, platforms and/or social media accounts operated by MGP or on MGP’s behalf.
If you do not want to combine data extracted from your own personal networking site, and our Website or other sites, please ensure that you log out of any social network sites before activating the Buttons.
Cookies
The Website uses cookies to allow MGP to gather information about how we can improve the Website. More information on how we use these cookies can be found in our Cookies Policy here.
Your Rights
You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes. We will inform you if we intend to use your data for such purposes or if we intend to disclose your information to any third party for such purposes. You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by contacting us at address below.
Access to information
The Act gives you the right to access information held about you. Your right of access can be exercised in accordance with the Act. Any access request may be subject to a fee of £10 to meet our costs in providing you with details of the information we hold about you. Any request should be made in writing and the best way for you to do so is to contact us at the address stated below. As MGP must be able to identify the person making the request, and because a fee may be due, MGP requests that you confirm any request made by you via different means by contacting us at the address stated below. Due to technological constraints and/or information security considerations, it may be inappropriate to use social media to supply information in response to any request by you for access to information, and so please provide an alternative delivery address for our response.
