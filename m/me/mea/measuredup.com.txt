Disclosure of Information:
1. Personally Identifiable Information: You provide certain personally identifiable information (such as your name, address, birth date or e-mail address - referred to in this Privacy Policy as PI) to MeasuredUp when choosing to participate in various activities on the Web Site such as uploading images, posting reviews, entering contests or sweepstakes, taking advantage of promotions, responding to surveys, or subscribing to newsletters or other mailing lists. Generally, you may browse our Web Site without providing us with PI. However, there may be times when we ask you to provide us with certain PI, such as when you choose to register with our Web Site or post a review. We may also ask you to provide us with demographic information or information regarding your interests, hobbies or similar information to enhance your viewing experience. MeasuredUp reserves the right, at any time, to modify, alter or add features to our Web Site that require you to register or otherwise provide additional PI or to require registration to access our Web Site. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you may not be able to participate in or view some of the Web Site's features. MeasuredUp does not sell, rent or share PI collected with other people other than that specifically described herein.
2. Underage users: The Web Site does not knowingly collect PI from children under thirteen (13) years of age. This is not a Web Site directed to children under the age of 13. If you are under 13 years of age, do not send any information about yourself to MeasuredUp. If MeasuredUp discovers that a child under the age of 13 has provided the Web Site with PI, we will delete that child's PI from the system.
3. Anonymous Information: When you visit the Web Site, our web servers automatically collect Web Site usage information. Web site usage information is anonymous information that describes how our visitors use and navigate our Web Site, and it includes the number and frequency of visitors to each web page and the time-span of their stays. MeasuredUp collects the anonymous information automatically as it is sent to us by your web browser as well as referrer data that identifies the web page visited prior and subsequent to visiting our Web Site, and IP address. We may also determine what technology is available through your browser in order to serve you the most appropriate version of a web page.
4. Log File Information: When visitors open pages from our Web Site, our servers log the visitor's IP address. MeasuredUp may collect IP addresses for a range of internal purposes, such as system administration, to report aggregate information to our business partners or to review the number of visits to different pages on our Web Site.
5. Cookies Information: When you visit the Web Site, MeasuredUp may send one or more cookies - a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. MeasuredUp does not store any PI in cookies, but it may link the cookie to any information it collects. You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers, which is standard in the Internet industry. MeasuredUp does not control these cookies, and these cookies are not subject to our Privacy Policy. Visitors to our Web Site should check the Privacy Policy of the advertiser to determine how it uses cookies. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of our Web Site may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.

The advertiser may also use information regarding your use of the Web Site, such as the number of times you viewed an ad (but not any PI), to calculate which ads it should send to you.
3. If you are concerned with the use of your non-personal information by these third party advertisers, you should consult their respective privacy policies for more information on their practices and for instructions on how to opt-out of certain practices.
