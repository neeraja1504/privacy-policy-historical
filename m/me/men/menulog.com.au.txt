4.3. Amending or cancelling your Order: Once you submit your Order and your payment has been authorised, you will not be entitled to change or cancel your Order online (please refer to paragraph 4.4 for details of the process relating to rejected Orders). If you wish to change or cancel your Order, you may contact the Restaurant directly or our Customer Care team as described in paragraph 6.3 and they will attempt to contact the Restaurant in order to communicate your requests. However, there is no guarantee that we will be able to reach the Restaurant or that the Restaurant will agree to your requests as they may have already started to process your Order.
4.4. Payment authorisation: Where any payment you make is not authorised, your Order will not be processed by or communicated to the relevant Restaurant.
4.5. Processing your Order and Restaurant rejections: On receipt of your Order, we will begin processing it by sending it to the relevant Restaurant and will notify you by email that your Order has been received and is being processed. Any confirmation page that you may see on the Website and any Order confirmation e-mail that you may receive each merely indicate that your Order has been received and is being processed by us, and does not necessarily mean that your Order has been accepted by the Restaurant. Restaurants have the discretion to reject Orders at any time because they are too busy, due to weather conditions or for any other reason. We encourage all our Restaurants to accept all Orders and to communicate any rejection promptly, and we will notify you (generally by email) as soon as reasonably practicable if a Restaurant rejects your Order.Â  When a Restaurant confirms receipt of the order and expected collection or delivery time, we will send you an SMS confirmation (provided that you have given us your mobile telephone number).
4.6. Delivery of your Order: Estimated times for deliveries and collections are provided by the Restaurants and are only estimates. Neither we nor the Restaurants guarantee that Orders will be delivered or will be available for collection within the estimated times. All food preparation and deliveries are the sole responsibility of the Restaurant accepting the Order. To the extent permitted by law, including the Australian Consumer Law, Menulog accepts no liability associated with food preparation or delivery by the Restaurant accepting the order.

These will be added to the total amount due where applicable.
5.2. Incorrect pricing: This Website contains a large number of menus and it is possible that some of the menus may include incorrect prices. The products will be sold for the displayed price even if the correct price for an Order is higher than the price stated on the Website.
5.3. Payment methods: Payment for Orders must be made by an accepted credit or debit card through the Website or in cash to the Restaurant at the point of delivery to you.
5.4. Card payments: If you pay by credit or debit card, you may be required to show the card to the Restaurant at the time of delivery as proof of identification and so that they can check that the card conforms with the receipt data for the Order. Please note that from time to time there may be delays with the processing of card payments and transactions; this may result in delays in sums being deducted from your bank account or charged to your credit or debit card.
5.5. Credit and discount vouchers: A credit or discount may apply to your Order if you use a promotional voucher or code recognised by the Website and endorsed by Menulog, and you pay for any balance by credit or debit card. Please refer to our Voucher Terms & Conditions for the full terms and conditions applicable to the use of credit and discount vouchers.
5.6. Rejected Orders: Once you have submitted an Order that you are paying for by credit or debit card and your payment has been authorised, you will be charged the full amount of your Order. If your Order is subsequently rejected by the Restaurant (as described in paragraph 4.4 above) or cancelled for any other reason, your bank or card issuer will refund the relevant amount. However, this may take between 3 to 5 working days (or longer, depending on your bank or card issuer). You acknowledge and agree that neither we nor the relevant Restaurant will be responsible or liable to you in relation to this delay by your bank or card issuer in the release of funds back into your account.
