TeacherReviews.com: Privacy Policy
Privacy Policy
TeacherReviews.com is run by students, not some big corporation doing everything possible to make a buck.   We have no intention of selling or abusing your personal information, especially for monetary gain.  Everybody on the TeacherReviews.com team has an email address, and we all receive spam.   We will not add to this problem by sending spam to your email address, nor let other companies have access to your email address so they could do just that.
TeacherReviews is a community by students and for students, and it's a Web site that you should feel comfortable at.  We have listed bellow everything that we can think of relating to your personal information.  If you have any questions, please contact us.
personal information
At TeacherReviews.com, we intend to give you as much control as possible over your personal information. In general, you can visit the  sites without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. There are times, however, when we may need information from you, such as your email address. It is our intent to let you know before we collect personal information from you on the Internet.
If you choose to give us personal information -- for example to add a review or enter a contest -- it is our intent to let you know how we will use such information. If you tell us that you do not wish to have this information used as a basis for further contact with you, we will respect your wishes. We do keep track of the domains from which people visit us. We analyze this data for trends and statistics, and then we discard it.
TeacherReviews is the sole owner of the information gathered on our Web site.  Described below are the methods which TeacherReviews uses the information collected.  It is our policy NOT to sell or distribute any personally identifiable information.
**
email and spam
**
When creating a user account, TeacherReviews will ask you for your email address.  We use this to verify who you are.  This is done by sending you a unique email verification key.  If you do not put in your valid email address, you will not get this email and your reviews will not be made public.  Without this feature, the credibility of the reviews would be too questionable to be reliable.
This is the primary reason why we request your email address.  We may also use it to give you warnings, important news, or, of course, if you are one of the contest winners.
We will never send unsolicited email to you, nor will we sell your email address to anybody.
