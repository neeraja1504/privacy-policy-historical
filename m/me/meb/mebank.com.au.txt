However, we will only collect your personal information in this way if it is unreasonable or impractical to collect this information directly from you or if we are otherwise permitted to do so. To the extent we consider it relevant to assessing your application for consumer or commercial credit, we may obtain a credit report from a credit reporting body that contains personal information.
