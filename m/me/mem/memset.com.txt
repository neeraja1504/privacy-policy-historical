No data transfer will be undertaken that is outside of the strict scope of the Purposes states in this policy, or that will materially degrade the security of the Subject’s data or the Data Subject’s rights and in any event the security provisions will be compliant with the applicable Data Protection Laws. Such Data Processors and Sub Processors will be contractually bound to process only in accordance with our instructions and to maintain technical and organisational controls in compliance with our security policy and the requirements of the GDPR.
Commitment to confidentiality and security of processing
Memset will use appropriate technical and organisational security measures within our sphere of responsibility to ensure an appropriate level of confidentiality, integrity and, where Memset is the Data Controller, availability of Subject data and to ensure its availability in the event of a business continuity incident. Memset will undertake security and data protection assessments of any third parties we elect to use prior to transfer of any Customer Data and regularly thereafter.
Whilst Memset maintains configured encrypted endpoints for Control Panel and API HTTPS communication and appropriate internal security controls, the Subject retains sole responsibility for their data when outside of Memset systems.
