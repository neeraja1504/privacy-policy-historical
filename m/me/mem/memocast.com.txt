Memocast does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in. However, please note that if an advertiser asks Memocast to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-24) or audience segment (for example, men ages 18-24 who have viewed or purchased certain channels or videos) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they were trying to reach.
You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks. Memocast’s Privacy Notice does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites.
