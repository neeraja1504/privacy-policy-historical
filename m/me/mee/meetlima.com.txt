Lima service (for Lima users only)
For the purpose of keeping your Lima devices and apps functional, for security purposes and to help diagnose any technical issues that may arise on your Lima user account, our servers may receive and store information about the devices connected to your Lima user account. If you're a Lima user, or servers will keep a list of:
- The Lima devices attached to your Lima user account

For each device connected to your account (including your Lima devices), our servers may keep:
- The last IP and connection date of the device
- Its serial number or MAC address
- A general status indicating wether the Lima device or the Lima apps are properly setup or not (was the device/app paired successfully or not? Did it encounter an update error?)
- Any diagnostic reports that you accepted to share with the Lima customer service.
This information is only used to ensure the service continuity, to diagnose any problems that may arise on your Lima account (on your request).
