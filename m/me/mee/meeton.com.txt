Coookies, IP Addresses, and Other Software and Hardware Attributes
As you interact with the Site, we collect certain Site use information. This information is collected for all users. When you enter the Site, we collect your IP address, browser type, and other software and hardware attributes. In addition, we store certain information from your browser using cookies. A cookie is a small data file that is stored by your web browser on your computer. The cookies we use include, without limitation, session ID cookies and persistent cookies. This data may be used for security purposes, to track usage and to manage and improve the Site. Cookies also allow us to enhance, personalize and track your online experience, so that the information you receive is more relevant to you. This technology will allow you to move faster through our Site once the information is in our database since you do not have to re-enter the same information each time you enter the Site. Session ID cookies confirm that you are logged in. These cookies terminate once you close your browser. Persistent cookies store your login ID (but not your password) to make it easier for you to login when you come back to the Site. If you prefer, you can set your browser to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent; however, it is possible that some parts of the Service will not function properly if you do.
Legal Considerations
On rare occasions, we may disclose specific information upon governmental request, in response to a subpoena or court order, or when required by law to do so. Additionally, we may share account or other information when we believe it is necessary to comply with law, to protect our interests or property, to report and/or prevent fraud or other illegal activity perpetrated through the Site, or to prevent imminent bodily harm. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, agents or government agencies. We may also share information with companies assisting in fraud protection or investigation. We do not provide information to these agencies or companies for marketing or commercial purposes.
Third Party Advertising
Advertisements that appear on the Site are sometimes delivered directly to users by third party advertisers. The third party advertiser will automatically receive your IP address when this happens. These third party advertisers may also download cookies to your computer, or use other technologies such as JavaScript and "web beacons" (also known as "1x1 gifs") to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. Doing this allows the advertising network to recognize your computer each time they send you an advertisement in order to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. In this way, they may compile information about where individuals using your computer or browser saw their advertisements and determine which advertisements are clicked. MeetON.com does not have access to or control of the cookies that may be placed by the third party advertisers. Third party advertisers have no access to your contact information stored on the Site unless you choose to share it with them. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by MeetON.com on the Site and does not cover the use of cookies or other tracking technologies by any of its advertisers.
Additionally, these third party advertisers may serve ads and/or collect certain anonymous information when you visit the Site. These companies may use Non-Identifying Information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this Site and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information. To learn more about this behavioral advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit www.networkadvertising.org.

At any time, you may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information in your registration profile by contacting us.

Security
We employ reasonable physical, technological, and administrative security measures and attempt to ensure they are applicable under the circumstances. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored Personal Data (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you via email or conspicuous posting on this Site in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.

We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 14. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact us at privacy@meeton.com. If we become aware that a child under the age of 14 has provided us with Personal Information, we will delete such information from our files.
