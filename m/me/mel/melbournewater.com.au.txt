If you do not wish to accept cookies you can set your browser to refuse them. However, cookies allow you to fully utilise all our website services and we encourage you to accept them.
Google reCAPTCHA
We use a Google-provided tool called "reCAPTCHA" which, on some form submissions, is intended to tell humans from robots to prevent abuse of those forms by spam bots. The reCAPTCHA tool may, in its algorithm, make use of cookies as well as other information like IP address, date, time, language, screen size and resolution, and mouse movements while on the page.

Security
Melbourne Water is committed to holding your personal information securely. All stored information is protected from unauthorised access through the use of secure passwords and user log on or other security procedures.
This website also contains a business-trading sub-site that is operated by Melbourne Water and the Westpac Banking group. This sub-site enables Melbourne Water to accept online payments from you, using your credit card.
When Westpac captures data for online payments it is passed through a secure server using encryption technology to ensure that your information is protected when being sent over the Internet. This process does not involve Melbourne Water having access to, or collecting or recording, your credit card information.
