We are especially careful about the security and confidentiality of the information stored in persistent cookies. For example, we do not store account numbers or passwords in persistent cookies. Users can disable their web browsers’ ability to accept cookies and will be able to browse our website but will not be able to successfully use our software service.

We may also share information with third parties involved in the normal operations of our business, for example with contract research organizations (CROs), study sponsors, or others that are involved in study management as commonly done in our industry. We also reserve the right to fully use and disclose any information that is not in personally identifiable form (such as site usage statistics that do not identify you individually by name).
Medrio may also use a third-party intermediary to manage the credit card processing. This intermediary is solely a link in the distribution chain, and is not permitted to store, retain, or use the information provided, except for the sole purpose of credit card processing.
Medrio will not disclose personally identifiable information to any Agent unless it first either ascertains that the Agent adheres to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework or Swiss-U.S. Pricacy Shield Framework or is subject to the EU Directive on Data Protection or another adequacy finding or enters into a written agreement with such Agent requiring that the Agent provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the relevant Privacy Shield Principles.

Medrio may delay notification if Medrio or a law enforcement agency determines that the notification will impede a criminal investigation, unless and until Medrio or the agency determines that notification will not compromise the investigation.
