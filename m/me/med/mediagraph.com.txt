Privacy Policy - Adaptive Media
1. Our Commitment to Privacy.
Your use of any Adaptive Medias, Inc. (including its affiliates and licensors, “Adaptive”) website, and all others operated by Adaptive (each a “Site” and collectively, the “Sites”), provides you with information and access to Adaptive’s products and services (the “Adaptive Services”), and allows you to contact Adaptive for further information and support. This policy (the “Privacy Policy”) is designed to advise you how Adaptive collects, uses, and protects your personal information. By visiting any Site or by using the Adaptive Services, you are deemed to have accepted the terms of this Privacy Policy.
2. What Information is Collected.
Adaptive collects the following personal information:
(a) Personally-Identifiable Information. Adaptive collects any personally-identifiable information which you may voluntarily enter on a Site, or which you may give Adaptive in any other way in order to perform the Adaptive Services, which identifies you as a specific individual or entity, including, but not limited to, your name, email address, mailing address, phone number(s), and/or credit card number(s) (“PII”). Adaptive will only collect PII about you upon express prior notice, or if such information is expressly solicited and is voluntarily provided by you to Adaptive.
PII is collected on the Sites in the following instances: (i) information requests, when you submit an inquiry to Adaptive, and provide your name, address, email address, mailing address, and/or telephone number so that Adaptive is able to respond to the request; (ii) access to Adaptive’s console and platform applications, and Sites for use of certain Adaptive Services, where a username and password must be registered; (iii) feedback requests, when Adaptive may ask you to provide voluntary feedback to help Adaptive improve the Sites or Adaptive Services and you provide optional name and contact information; and/or (iv) other offers.
(b) Non-Personally-Identifiable Information. Adaptive may also collect non-personally identifiable information that does not reveal your specific identity (“Non-PII”). Non-PII includes optionally submitted demographic data about users, such as their age, gender, and city/state of residence. Non-PII also includes server log files that Adaptive maintains and stores regarding Sites’ users; the information contained in these files includes information a user’s browser automatically sends to the Site, such as information about a user’s web request, IP address, browser type/language, and the date and time of any visit. Collection and recordation of such data is a standard practice among website operators. Non-PII also includes “Cookies”. Cookies are pieces of information that are transferred to a user’s computer from a web server that allows Adaptive to keep records of users’ ongoing access and use of the Sites. This is a standard practice among website operators and can facilitate users’ ongoing access and use of the Sites. Most browsers are set up to accept Cookies, but you may change such settings by selecting the appropriate option(s) in your browser’s privacy options or settings menu to have your browser notify you upon receipt of a new Cookie, or to refuse to accept Cookies.
(c) Disclaimer. You may choose not to provide certain personal information or to disallow the use of Cookies, but be advised that by doing so, you may not be able to take advantage of certain Adaptive Services, including the use of a Site, or certain areas of the Site where such information is required for user access.
3. How and When Information is Used.
The information Adaptive collects is used for administering Adaptive’s business activities. Adaptive uses your PII to respond to inquiries and requests, keep accurate records concerning any Sites or the Adaptive Services you may request and use. Occasionally Adaptive may use voluntarily-provided PII to: (a) notify you about changes to the Sites or the Adaptive Services; (b) notify you of changes to Adaptive’s terms and conditions of use to a Site; (c) notify you of changes to terms and conditions of use of the Adaptive Services; or (d) notify you of the availability of new Sites or Adaptive Services, or other special offers.
Non-PII is used by Adaptive in its aggregated form to help Adaptive measure the Sites’ and the Adaptive Services’ performance and effectiveness, and to improve the Sites and the Adaptive Services. Some Sites and the Adaptive Services include the provision and serving of third-party advertising by Adaptive through its third-party advertising partners; in such cases, Adaptive and/or its third-party advertising partners may collect and use Non-PII for behavioral advertising purposes by tracking the viewing and usage of advertisements and delivering more relevant advertising pursuant to use of such Sites and Services.
