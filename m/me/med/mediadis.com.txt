| Privacy Statement
Mediadis presents this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. We assure you that your data will be treated in the respect of the law of December 8, 1992 on Protection of the Private Life. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website.
This site contains links to other websites. Mediadis is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content provided by those sites.
Our site uses an order form for customers to request information, products, and services. We collect visitor's contact information (like their email and delivery address) and financial information (credit card numbers). Contact information collected through the on-line registering form is only used to ship the ordered items to our customers and financial information is only used to bill for those purchases.
Please click on the link "YOUR ACCOUNT" and choose the option "Edit your billing details" to change your personal billing data or even erase your account. You can also send us your request to the adress on the bottom of the page.
Protection
Our website has security systems to avoid misuse or alteration of the personal information you send to us via internet. Moreover, we never store any credit card numbers from our clients on our server and that's why this is the only critical information you have to enter again for each new order !
Security
We, at Mediadis, believe that our customers deserve the strongest security measures available. That's why all our orders are sent via an SSL Secure Connection (3.0). If you want to check our Site's Security Certificate, click on the locked padlock located at the bottom of your browser, when you are on our Order Form. The information shown in the window, which will then pop-up, insure you that all your critical data (including credit card information) will be encrypted on the way to our offices, protecting it from any hacker attack.
