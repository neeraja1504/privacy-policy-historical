A cookie will usually contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has come, the "lifetime" of the cookie, and a value (usually a randomly generated unique number). We use two types of cookies on this website:
Session cookies - temporary cookies that remain in the cookie file of your browser until you leave the site. Session cookies are used to carry information across pages of the Sites so you don’t have to re-enter information in order to access areas of your account such as stored files.
Persistent cookies – cookies that remain in the cookie file of your browser for much longer (though how long will depend on the lifetime of the specific cookie). Persis-tent cookies are used to help us recognize you as a unique visitor when you return to our website.

We also use persistent cookies to compile anonymous, aggregated statistics that allow us to understand how the Sites are used and to help us improve the structure of the Sites.
b. Third Party Cookies. We may allow third parties to use cookies on the Sites but we do not control the use or contents of third party cookies. Web browsers often allow you to erase existing cookies from your hard drive, block the use of cookies and/or be notified when cookies are encountered. If you elect to block cookies, please note that you may not be able to take full advantage of the features and functions of the Sites.
c. Web Beacons. Web beacons are images inserted in a webpage or email, which may be used to count the number of visitors to the Sites, monitor the behavior of the Site user, store the IP address of the user, store the duration of the interaction, and store the type of web browser that was used, among other information. We may use web beacons to im-prove user experiences on the Sites and learn more about our customers and visitors to the Sites. Web Beacons collect only limited information which includes a cookie number; time and date of a page view; and a description of the page on which the Web Beacon re-sides. Web becons do not contain any Personal Information.
d. Disabling and Enabling Cookies. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies by modifying the settings in your browser. However, you may not be able to use all the inter-active features of the Sites if cookies are disabled.

e. Deleting cookies. You can easily delete any cookies that have been installed in the cookie folder of your browser. Type "cookies" in the search box of the "Help" function of your browser for information on where to find your cookie folder.
f. Do Not Track Browser Requests. Web browsers often also allow you to send a “Do Not Track” request with your browsing traffic, which would enable anonymous browsing. Our service provider does not honor Do Not Track requests from web browsers.
