We use the information you provide to inform the schools of your interest and the best way of getting in contact with you. You may be contacted via phone, text, postal mail, or email by a representative of the school. You may request information from more than one school, which means you may be contacted by each school. We may sell your information to other partner companies if your request for information is rejected by a school. In this case a partner may contact you with other educational offers. If you opt into the newsletter, you may receive other info from our site or our partners. This is not a required question to complete the form.
