Privacy Policy | Medieval Times Dinner & Tournament
At Medieval Times USA, Inc., we respect your privacy. This Privacy Policy covers how we collect, store, use, disclose, and transfer information we may collect from you when you visit our website or communicate with us through this website. Please familiarize yourself with our Privacy Policy, and review it periodically. Medieval Times may update its Privacy Policy from time to time.
Collection of Personal Information
We may ask you to provide personal information through this website which may identify you. Medieval Times may share this personal identifying information with its affiliates. Medieval Times and its affiliates may also combine the personal information you supply on this website with other information to provide and improve our services, content, and advertising. You are not required to provide the personal information we request; however, if you chose not to provide the information, we may be unable to provide you with the services you request, and we may be unable to respond to your communications.
By way of example, when you purchase tickets on our website, you may be asked to provide personal information, including your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, and payment or credit card information. When purchasing tickets, you also have the opportunity to sign up for periodic emails concerning events in your area or entertainment offers.
Likewise, you may be asked to provide personal information in response to our customer surveys, sweepstakes, or contests, when you request to join our Birthday Fellowship, or when you request to participate in similar promotions.
Use of Personal Information
The personal information you provide allows us to provide ticket and other services to you. It also allows us to send you updates on events and entertainment offers from Medieval Times and our affiliates. If you do not want to be on our mailing list, you may opt out anytime by contacting us at one of the addresses listed in our Privacy Policy under “Controlling Your Information.”
We also use personal information to help us operate and improve our website, improve our services, products, and advertising, and for loss prevention and anti-fraud purposes. For example, we may use your personal information, including date of birth, to confirm you are not a minor or to provide age-appropriate services to you. We may also use personal information for internal purposes, including auditing, data analysis, and for communications with you. If you provide personal information for a customer survey, sweepstakes, contest, or to join our Birthday Fellowship or respond to similar promotions, we may use your personal information to administer those programs and other internal uses. We may also use information you provide us when carrying out a purchase transaction to track your purchases or fulfillment of your orders.
Occasionally, we may use your personal information to send important communications, including notices about your ticket purchases, changes to our privacy policies, or changes to our terms and conditions. Because this information is vital to your use of our website and your communications with us, you may not opt out of receiving those important communications.
