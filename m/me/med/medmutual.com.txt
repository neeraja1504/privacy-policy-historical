Collection of Personal Information
You should be aware that portions of this Site contain functions for collecting your personal information including your name and email address as well as your history of accessing this Site.

We do not collect personal information (such as names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses or credit card numbers) about you, except when you specifically provide the information on a voluntary basis, such as when you:
Become a registered user of one or more of our services;
Establish an account with us;

Medical Mutual requires that the actual user input such information and that such information be the most recent available.

Whenever you register for one or more of our services, we may send an email to you with an authentication link to ensure the accuracy of the email address that you have supplied or to notify you that an application or quotation was requested. Your response to the authentication link may be necessary to complete your registration, which may be required to use our services.

If you use our Mobile Application, we may use GPS technology (or other similar technology) to determine your current location in order to determine the city you are located within and display a location map with relevant information.

Use of Personally Identifiable Information
Medical Mutual reserves the right to compile, save, use within the scope of our activities, and analyze any and all of your data (registration data, use history, etc.). Medical Mutual intends to use such data for internal purposes only, including without limitation for the purposes of responding to your requests for information and for contacting you. Medical Mutual may provide aggregated statistics about users (including you) to third parties, but such information will be aggregated so that it does not identify a particular individual or company, including yourself.
Medical Mutual may contact you regarding the status of your account, your registration information, support issues regarding our service, and changes to our service or the terms under which it is offered.
Medical Mutual may use your personally identifiable information for several purposes, including to:
provide you with information or services you request;

resolve disputes;
comply with laws and regulations;
prevent prohibited activities and enforce our Terms of Use;
facilitate your use of, and our operation of, our services;
analyze trends and statistics and for marketing, research, and development
deliver targeted service updates; and
verify information with third parties.
Additionally, we may disclose your personally identifiable information when required by law, rule, or regulation. Specifically, we may disclose this information to unrelated parties in special cases when we have reason to believe that our disclosure is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against a person or persons who may be causing injury to, or interference with, the rights or property of Medical Mutual (including our Site), computer users accessing our Site, or any third party. In addition, we may disclose information about individuals who access our Site to law enforcement agencies, judicial or government authorities or to other individuals or entities in response to subpoenas, court orders or other legal processes.
Further, in the event that Medical Mutual goes through a business transition, such as a merger, an acquisition by another company, or a sale of all or a portion of its assets, your and other users’ personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. If as a result of the business transition, your personal information will be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, you will be given the option to continue sharing the information consistent with this Privacy Policy. Nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to interfere with the ability of Medical Mutual to transfer all or part of its business and/or assets (including the Site) for any purposes, without limitation.
Finally, we may use your information as otherwise necessary or useful for us to conduct our business, so long as such use is permitted by law.
If you are an inactive registered user of My Health Plan, we may retain your information for up to twelve (12) months after you are no longer active.

Anonymous information is not personally identifiable information. Anonymous information is information that is collected automatically that relates to, but is not limited to, how certain features of our Site are used, the general region from which our visitors are contacting us and how many people visit our Site at any given time. We use anonymous information and may share with, or license or sell this information to, third parties for the purpose of allowing marketing through our Site.

Security
Medical Mutual uses safeguards, such as data encryption, firewalls, and system security measures to protect the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information.

We cannot guarantee that our Site is 100% safe from illegal tampering or “hacking.” Any data transmitted over the Internet may be at risk; however, once it is received at Medical Mutual and entered into a Medical Mutual database, any data you have submitted has the same protection that Medical Mutual extends to its own confidential information.
Agents and contractors of Medical Mutual who have access to personally identifiable information are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy by, for example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for Medical Mutual.
