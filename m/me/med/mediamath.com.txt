As a Data Management Platform, our technology enables our clients to control and activate data and provides them tools to onboard, segment and understand their data.
When MediaMath processes your personal data as a controller in the context of operating the Platform, the controller of your personal data is MediaMath, Inc.

Data pertaining to children
MediaMath’s products and services are not designed for children, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from or about any children. If we are made aware that we have received personal data from or about a child, we will use reasonable efforts to remove that data from our records.
Links, other websites and other third parties
This Policy relates solely to the personal data we collect and process about you in relation to our Platform, our Website, and other interactions you may have with MediaMath described in this Policy. MediaMath’s Website contains links to other sites, and the ads delivered by the Platform may run on a variety of other sites. Clicking on those links, accessing other sites, or enabling those connections may allow third parties to collect or share data about you. MediaMath does not control these third-party sites and is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. You should refer to the privacy statements of such third-party websites to find out how they collect and use your personal data and whether and for what purpose they use cookies. Also, as explained below in Section 5, third parties may process personal data from you when you visit the Website. Such processing is governed by privacy statements of such third parties.
2. The data collected via the Platform
While MediaMath collects certain categories of personal data in the course of delivering an ad to you via the Platform, we do not intentionally collect data that reveals your real-world identity, such as your name, address, phone number, or any government identifiers such as your Social Security Number. Instead, MediaMath collects certain data about your computer or device through the use of cookies and other similar technologies, as explained below.
We may assign a unique identifier called a MediaMath ID to your browser, mobile device, or connected television and over-the-top television devices (“ OTT TV Device ”) when we serve an ad to it or you use it to access a client’s digital properties, including their websites, emails, apps, and websites, emails, and apps where their ads appear (“ Digital Properties ”). The MediaMath ID enables the Platform to determine within a reasonable level of confidence that a computer or device is the same as one with which the Platform has previously interacted. For example, the MediaMath ID allows us to determine that a browser or device to which we served an ad on Monday is likely to be the same browser or device for which we observed a purchase on Tuesday. In some cases, based on third-party data, we are able to infer within a reasonable probability that a particular computer or device should be associated with the same MediaMath ID. For example, a client may provide us with hashed personal data that (if unhashed) would reveal your real-world identity, and we may use that data to associate your devices with each other. Also, our partners may provide us with associations that they have made based on data they collect from you. Where we are able to make such inferences, we may use this information to deliver targeted ads across multiple computers or devices. This is sometimes referred to as cross-device advertising.
The MediaMath ID can be a cookie ID (a unique ID assigned randomly by MediaMath to an unrecognized browser), a mobile advertising ID (a unique ID assigned by the mobile operating system, e.g. Apple ID for Advertising or Android Advertising ID), an OTT TV Device Identifier for Advertising (a unique ID assigned by an OTT TV provider, e.g., Roku ID for Advertising), or a statistical ID (created by MediaMath). We use information about your computer or device to generate the statistical ID, including your operating system, user-agent string, Internet Protocol (“ IP ”) address, installed fonts, and similar information. This information makes your computer or device distinct enough for our systems to determine within a reasonable probability that they are encountering the same computer or device over time, including in environments where MediaMath cookies are not supported.
Your MediaMath ID is associated with other categories of personal data that we collect about you. These categories include the following:
Bid Request Data and Impression Data: MediaMath collects personal data about you when we have the opportunity to show you an ad on Digital Properties and when we deliver an ad. We refer to this data as Bid Request Data and Impression Data, and we receive this data from media supply sources, such as publishers (i.e. organizations who operate Digital Properties) and exchanges or supply-side platforms who display ads on publishers' Digital Properties. This data includes: your imprecise location (e.g., country, region, postal code), browser type (e.g., Chrome or Internet Explorer); operating system (e.g., Mac OS or Windows); browser language (e.g., English or Spanish); IP address; Internet Service Provider (e.g., Comcast or Verizon); and either a MediaMath ID or an ID that one of our partners may assign to your browser or device, which we may associate with the MediaMath ID that we assigned to your browser or device. It also may include Precise Location Data, such as GPS-level latitude-longitude coordinates or location-based radio frequency signal triangulation. When we process Precise Location Data, the mobile app publisher or other media supply source is responsible for enabling you to provide or withdraw consent with respect to the collection and use of your Precise Location Data. Please check the settings of the mobile app and your device if you would like to change your preferences in relation to Precise Location Data.
Pixel Data and Other Client Data: MediaMath clients may use the Platform to collect data regarding your interactions with them when you visit their Digital Properties. We also may collect the same data when you visit the Website. This includes information such as the time you visited the site, the page URL, your IP address, your browser type (e.g., Chrome or Internet Explorer), the operating system (e.g., Mac OS or Windows), the type of device you use (e.g. laptop or desktop), and data regarding your activities on the Digital Properties. For example, if you are shopping for a product online, place a product in your online shopping cart, or make an online purchase, the client associated with the website or app may use the Platform to collect that data and later show you an ad on a different site or app related to that product. MediaMath clients also may use the Platform to collect hashed personal data that (if unhashed) would reveal your real-world identity, such as hashed email addresses. We refer to everything described above as Pixel Data. Clients also may import data that they have obtained outside the Platform, such as segments that our clients create or obtain independently from other third-party sources. A segment is a grouping of users who share one or more attributes (e.g., “car enthusiast”). Clients also may import data that they may possess or independently obtain offline, such as data regarding a purchase you made in the client’s store. The client’s offline data is first processed by a third party, which removes any data that reveals your real-world identity, appends a MediaMath ID, and transmits the file to MediaMath for processing. We refer to this data as Other Client Data.
Third-Party Segment Data and Other Third-Party Data: When they choose to provide it to us, we also receive personal data from third parties. We work with data providers who create and provide us with segments for our clients to use for advertising purposes. We refer to this as Third-Party Segment Data. We also send personal data to and receive personal data from third-party partners that allows them and/or us to associate the MediaMath ID with those partners’ identifiers (through a process called “cookie syncing”) as well as data that associates your different devices with each other. We refer to this data in the Policy as Other Third-Party Data.
Special or Sensitive Categories of Personal Data: We do not knowingly collect any special categories of personal data about individuals in the EEA, including: personal data revealing your racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership; personal data concerning your health, sex life, or sexual orientation; and genetic or biometric data. MediaMath also does not knowingly collect any data about other sensitive categories such as personal data about children, financial account numbers, insurance plan numbers, and criminal convictions or offenses.
3. How data is collected via the Platform
The Platform uses various technologies to collect your personal data from Digital Properties. We also may receive your personal data directly from our clients and partners.
Cookies and other ad-targeting technologies
Like most digital marketing platforms, MediaMath uses cookies and other technologies to recognize computers and devices and collect the categories of data described above in Section 2 so that we and our clients are able to understand your interests, deliver more relevant advertising to you, measure the impact of that advertising, and better understand your digital media usage patterns.
The types of technologies used via the Platform that enable us, our clients, and our partners to identify a computer or device, and enable the Platform to function and serve more relevant ads include:
Cookies – Cookies are small text files that contain a string of characters. MediaMath uses cookies to uniquely identify an Internet browser. Certain browsers or browser settings sometimes block cookies, and cookies may not work effectively on some mobile devices.
Pixel Tags – Pixel tags are transparent images, iFrames, or JavaScript that we, our clients, and our partners use to understand how users interact with their Digital Properties.
Collection of data from third parties
As described above, we receive personal data from our clients and partners. Specifically, our clients and partners may send us segments that include you and personal data they have obtained about you, our partners may provide us with data that allows us to associate the MediaMath ID with unique identifiers that they may have and data that associates your different devices with each other, and media supply sources, such as publishers and the digital advertising companies with whom publishers work, may send us Bid Request Data and Impression Data. We receive this data in a number of ways, including through server-to-server transfers, a process called “cookie syncing” and other partner calls to MediaMath originating from the browser.
4. How the Platform uses data
We use the personal data that we collect to deliver more relevant ads to you. We also use it to improve our Platform and the products and services that we provide to our clients and partners, and to create new products and services. We have set out below a description of specific ways we use your personal data in the Platform.

Creation of segments
As described above, a segment is a grouping of users who share one or more attributes. Our clients may use health-related segments about non-sensitive conditions such as an inferred interest in health and wellness or cough medicine and allergy medications. Click here for a list of the standard health-related segments provided for use by clients in MediaMath’s Platform.
While MediaMath does not knowingly create segments that are based upon what we consider to be sensitive information (for example, we do not create segments of EEA users based on personal data considered to be sensitive in the EEA, such as personal data revealing your racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, personal data concerning your health, sex life or sexual orientation, or genetic or biometric data), our clients may use the Platform to process some sensitive data, which may come from our clients’ Digital Properties or our partners. We take steps designed to ensure that this is done in compliance with applicable laws and self-regulatory guidelines, including through our contracts and policies with our clients and partners.
Automated decision-making and profiling
The Platform uses proprietary algorithms to make decisions about whether or not to bid on opportunities to serve you ads and, if so, how much to bid. The ads you see are the result of client campaigns that specify how much to spend and on what basis to spend combined with the use of our algorithms. The ways in which we use algorithms to determine bid prices may be considered automated decision-making in certain jurisdictions. Additionally, these processes, in combination with client campaigns described below, may constitute profiling in certain jurisdictions.
As explained above, we assign a MediaMath ID to your browser or device. Using proprietary technology, we associate data that we collect about you with this MediaMath ID and create segments using inferred details about certain of your preferences, behaviors, and demographic information. Many of our clients’ campaigns rely on such segments. For example, if you are browsing a shoes website we may infer that you are interested in buying sneakers, and if your IP address is associated with a geographic range where the population is mostly below the age of 50, we may put your MediaMath ID in a segment of individuals ages 25-34. If a client wants to advertise sneakers to potential shoe buyers between 25-34 years, for example, the client may choose to target that segment. If MediaMath receives an opportunity to show you an ad on a publisher’s website or in a publisher’s app, that client may be one of the many who are eligible to bid to serve an ad to you.
The automated processes that we use do not affect your legal rights (such as your right to vote, take legal action, or freely associate with others) or your ability to receive social benefits or obtain citizenship, nor do they have legal effects on you. Also, we do not knowingly process or make automated decisions about EEA users based on any data that falls into special categories in the EEA. As described below, you have the right to object to this automated processing at any time and you may have additional rights described in Section 11.
Legal basis for processing
Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal data described above will depend on the personal data concerned and the specific context in which we process it. However, we will normally collect personal data from you only where the processing is in our (or a third party's, such as our clients’) legitimate interests and not overridden by your rights, such as your right to opt out. If we collect and use your personal data in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), this interest will normally be to operate the Platform and serve you ads on behalf of our clients. We may have other legitimate interests and, if appropriate, we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.
If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal data, please contact us using the contact details provided under the “How to contact us” heading above.
Opt-out and choice mechanisms
If you want to limit the data MediaMath collects and processes about you and want us not to target ads that are based on your interests to your browsers or devices, you may opt out from MediaMath tracking and interest-based advertising at any time through one of the ways described below. If you opt out, you will still see ads, but those ads are not likely to have anything to do with products or services you care about. With interest-based advertising, you receive ads and offers that are more likely to be useful to you.
Your opt-out is only applicable to the Platform and does not opt you out from platforms provided by third-party companies. However, you can opt out from both MediaMath and many third-party companies at once; to do so, please see “Other ways to opt out” below. When you opt out, MediaMath will collect and process data from your browser, app, or device only as needed to honor your opt-out and for limited research and development purposes to improve our browser- and device-recognition technology, which also helps to improve our ability to honor your opt-out. When you opt out, MediaMath also stops targeting interest-based advertising to the opted-out browser, app or device.
If you use multiple browsers or devices and wish to limit the data MediaMath collects and processes and do not wish to receive MediaMath interest-based advertising on any of them, you must opt out from each browser and device individually.
Opt out in a browser
You may opt out if you are using a browser by clicking the “Click here to opt out” link below. Please note that if cookies are not enabled in your browser, including if third-party cookies are disabled, or if you use certain ad-blocking tools, our opt-out mechanism may not work properly. Please also note that deleting your cookies does not opt you out. Please be aware that if you clear your cookies, or if you use a different browser or device, you will need to renew your opt-out choice.
Opt out this browser (if using a browser)
Your current opt-out status with MediaMath in this web browser is:
Opt out in the mobile application environment
You may opt out in mobile app environments using the “AppChoices” mobile application, where applicable, which you can download to your mobile device from your App Store or via the Digital Advertising Alliance AppChoices page here.

Other ways to limit ad tracking in the mobile and OTT TV Device application environment
You also may limit ad tracking in mobile app environments on your mobile device as well as on your OTT TV Device. For the most effective and up-to-date methods for doing so, you should consult instructions provided by those device manufacturers.

Where MediaMath receives a signal to limit ad tracking, we will collect and process data from your device only as needed to honor your choice and for limited research and development purposes to improve our device-recognition technology, which also helps to improve our ability to honor your choice. Where MediaMath receives a signal to limit ad tracking, MediaMath also will not serve interest-based advertising in the apps on your mobile device or OTT TV Device.
If you have questions about how to opt out or limit ad tracking, please contact us at privacy@mediamath.com.

In some cases, we also may have a legal obligation to collect personal data from you. If we ask you to provide personal data to comply with a legal requirement, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal data is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal data). Where we are required by applicable law to obtain your consent, for instance (in some cases) in order to send you marketing communications, we will do so, and in such cases the legal basis for our processing of personal data will be your consent. If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal data, please contact us using the contact details provided under the “How to contact us” heading above.
