The online protection and privacy of children is especially important to us. No information should be submitted online by guests under 13 years of age without the prior consent of their parent or guardian. Any personal information voluntarily provided by guests age 13 years and under with their parents' consent is used for the sole purpose of enhancing the interactivity of our site and Kids Zone services.
We NEVER make the personal information of anyone we know is under 13 years of age available to anyone outside of HolidayChannel unless required to do so by law.
When a child age 13 years and under registers for the HolidayChannel Elf Club we ask that he/she provide a parent's e-mail address so that we can alert the parent to their child's registration and subsequent activities. While children who register for the Elf Club do receive periodic newsletters such as the Elf Club News, any information collected from guests under 13 years of age is never used in any form for promotional or marketing purposes.
Children writing Santa are not required to have or supply his/her e-mail address. If a child does provide his/her email address s/he will receive a reply from Santa. It is our policy, however, not to send subsequent e-mail offers or promotions to children using the e-mail addresses provided for this purpose.
To further ensure the online safety of children a number of tools and resources exist to assist parents. Listed below are links that parents can use to better manage their child's online experience.
