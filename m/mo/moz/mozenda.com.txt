This Privacy Policy (the “Policy” or “Privacy Policy”) covers Mozenda, Inc. (“Mozenda”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) and describes the types of information we gather from people visiting www.mozenda.com (the “Site”) and from individual users interacting with the applications we provide to third parties and how we use such information. We understand the importance of privacy and accordingly, treat all information received in a responsible manner. By accessing the Site, you agree to be bound by this Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Policy, please do not use the Site or our Services. Each time you use the Site or Services, the current version of the Privacy Policy will apply. Accordingly, when you use the Site or Services, you should check the date of this Policy (which appears at the top) and review any changes since the last version.
Types Of Information We Collect
Mozenda may collect two types of information from users of our Site: “personal information” which is information that can be used to locate you, contact you, or determine your specific identity (such as name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number, etc.) and “aggregate information” which is information about your activities on the Site or in connection with the Services that cannot be used to identify, locate, or contact you (such as frequency of visits to the Site, data entered when using the Site, Site pages most frequently accessed, browser type, etc.).
Collecting Your Personal Information
Mozenda collects personal information that is voluntarily provided when a user on our Site creates an account or logs in to their account. Specifically, when you sign up for an account, we ask you for your name, email address, and business information, among other information. This information is used to assist us in helping you select the appropriate service package. Mozenda also collects and stores information about our user’s use of the Site and our Services, including page scraping activities, so that information gathered by a user through our Site or Services can be served up each time a user logs in to the Site.
Collecting Your Aggregate Information
Aggregate information is collected as you visit our Site or interact with our Services even if you do not enter any information. Generally, aggregate information is used in a collective manner, and no single person can be identified by that compiled information. Mozenda uses aggregate information to provide its Services, as well as to determine the use of our Site and to monitor, audit and analyze information pertaining to our business metrics.
Sharing, Selling and Trading of Your Personal Information with Third Parties
Mozenda on occasion, may share personal information with third party service providers as we deem necessary for the third party to fulfill their duties, such as fulfilling orders, processing credit card payments, or other functions necessary to our business. These third party service providers are not authorized to retain, share, store or use your personal information for any purposes other than to provide the Services for which they have been hired to provide. When you submit your personal information, you also agree that we may use your personal information to contact you by email, telephone, cell phone, direct mail, or text message about certain offers made available by us or third parties that we believe you might be interested in based on information you have provided to us. We do not sell, trade or otherwise share your personal information with unrelated third parties for their own marketing purposes, however, we may market certain offers to you on behalf of third parties we determine you might be interested in.
We use your personal and aggregate information in an effort to improve your experience on the Site and with the Services, and to communicate with you about information that you request. We may also use this information to help us target specific Services or offers to you, to help us develop and improve the Site and Services, and to tailor our Site and Services to your interests.
Sharing, Selling and Trading Aggregate Information Collected Online with Third Parties
We may use aggregate information to improve the Site and Services, to monitor traffic and general usage patterns, and for other general business purposes. We may disclose aggregate information to third parties for a variety of business reasons, including to potential investors so that they may better understand our user base, etc. Aggregate information will not include any personal information and we will not disclose any personal information except as expressly stated elsewhere in this Policy.
Other Instances When We Share Your Information
In addition to the foregoing, Mozenda may elect to share or transfer your personal information to unrelated third parties: (i) to comply with a legal requirement, judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on Mozenda, (ii) to investigate a possible crime, such as fraud or identity theft; (iii) in connection with the sale, purchase, merger, reorganization, liquidation or dissolution of Mozenda; (iv) when we believe it is necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of Mozenda or other persons, or (v) as otherwise required or permitted by law.
