Privacy and Legal Statements for the Mohawk College Website
Mohawk College collects and retains personal information of students, alumni and other parties, including but not limited to faculty, staff and private citizens as part of services the college provides, under the legal authority of The Ontario Colleges of Applied Arts and Technology Act, 2002, S.O. 2002, Schedule F ("OCAAT Act"). This information is used for the academic, administrative, employment-related, financial, statistical and other appropriate purposes of the College. In all circumstances, when dealing with personal information of any individual Mohawk is obligated to adhere to the provisions of the Ontario Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA)
The information collected by Mohawk College may be used, among other things, to admit, register and graduate students, record academic achievement, issue identity cards and, where applicable, facilitate local transit passes, to provide access to information technology systems and to operate academic, financial, athletic, recreational, residence, alumni and other College programs. Information on admissions, registration and academic achievement may also be disclosed:
(a) as part of day to day operations of the college,
(b) used for statistical and research purposes by the College,
(c) where it is necessary and proper in the discharge of the collegeâ€™s functions, or
(d) as required under law.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Mohawk College is required to disclose personal information such as Ontario Education Numbers, student characteristics and educational outcomes to the Minister of Training, Colleges and Universities under s. 15 of the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities Act, R.S.O. 1990, Chapter M. 19, as amended, under the authority of the Ontario Colleges of Applied Arts and Technology Act, 2002. The ministry collects this data for purposes such as planning, allocating and administering public funding to colleges, universities and other post-secondary educational and training institutions and to conduct research and analysis, including longitudinal studies, and statistical activities conducted by or on behalf of the ministry for purposes that relate to post-secondary education and training. Further information on the collection and use of student-level enrolment-related data can be obtained from the Ministry of Training Colleges and Universities website: http://www.tcu.gov.on.ca/.
In addition, the federal Statistics Act provides the legal authority for Statistics Canada to obtain access to personal information held by educational institutions. The information may be used for statistical purposes only, and the confidentiality provisions of the Statistics Act prevent the information from being released in any way that would identify a student. Students who do not wish to have their information used can ask Statistics Canada to remove their identifying information from the national database. On request by a student, Statistics Canada will delete an individual's contact information (name, address, or other personal identifiers) from the PSIS database. To make such a request, please contact:
