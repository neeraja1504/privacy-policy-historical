We use Web Beacons – sometimes called single pixel gifs – which allow the Sites to collect web log information. A web beacon is a graphic on a web page or in an email message designed to track pages viewed or messages opened. Web log information is gathered when You visit one of more of our Sites by the computer which hosts our website (webserver). The webserver automatically recognises some non-personal information, such as the date/time You visited our site, the pages You visited, the website You came from, the type of browser You are using (e.g. windows 2000), and the domain name and address of Your Internet Service Provider.

IP Addresses
Our Sites use Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. IP addresses are assigned to Your computer by Your Internet Service Provider (ISP) so You can access the internet. Typically the IP address assigned to You will change each time You connect to the internet providing You with a dynamic address. If You are accessing our Sites via broadband connection it is possible that the IP address we collect or even a cookie we might use, may contain information that could be deemed identifiable. This is because with some broadband connections the IP address does not change so is termed static which could be associated with Your personal computer. We use Your IP address to report aggregate information on use and to help improve our Sites.
Areas of our Sites that collect Your information use industry standard secure socket layer encryption (SSL); however, to take advantage of this Your browser must support encryption protection (found in internet explorer release 3.0 and above).
