Privacy Policy | MoonDog Sports
MoonDogSports.com takes the privacy of our subscribers and users very seriously. This policy describes how we handle the information you provide us when you visit or subscribe to the site.
During the course of operating this web site, MoonDogSports.com does drop cookies, small text files, onto your hard drive. This is to allow us to recognize you as a subscriber or user and allows us to compile statistical data pertaining to the site’s usage.
Any personal information gathered will remain with MoonDogSports.com and will not be sold, leased, lent, shared, or leaked to any third parties for marketing purposes without your express permission.
However, we may disclose information you provide if required to do so by law or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with legal process served on us; (2) protect and defend our rights or property; or (3) act in an emergency to protect someone’s safety.
We have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. These include a firewall to prevent unauthorized access to our systems and maintenance of registration information in a separate database. Although we will exercise reasonable care in providing secure transmission of information between your computer and our servers, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information transmitted to us over the Internet and we accept no liability for any unintentional disclosure.
We maintain archives of our web logs, database, and other systems and information. Please note that it is possible some of this information may remain archived after we delete the information from its active database (see above regarding web logs). We maintain archives for disaster recovery, legal and other non-marketing purposes.
If you are visiting our site from outside the United States, please be advised that because we operate internationally, and certain of our computer systems are currently based in the United States, your personal data will be processed by us in the U.S. where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world, such as the European Union. By using the Web Site, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.
We do not retrieve any information from a computer unrelated to our site or services. Our third party advertisers may place a cookie as part of serving ads on our site.
All communication on the Internet takes place between pairs of IP Addresses. Our Web servers will log the IP address from which any connection is made. We may use these IP addresses to help diagnose technical problems or prevent abuse of our systems or other site users.
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.
