Capitalized terms that are not defined in this policy are defined in our Terms of Use. Our expectation is that Mojostreet Users will use this service for harmless social purposes. We would like to extend a cautionary note however, that by its nature, your location information may be subject to misuse and over-monitoring by others including your friends, family, or acquaintances.

How Is My Information Shared?
Sharing with friends
Your “friends” see the location and time of each of your check-ins, tips and photos (that you leave there), presidentships. While your friends will be able to see the time of your check-ins, other users will only be shown the date of the check-in. Individuals reading this information may use it or disclose it to other individuals or entities without our control and without your knowledge. Hence we urge you to exercise caution while adding a user as a “friend”.
Sharing with everyone
Information such as your name and picture, social network links, presidentships, list of friends, tips, photos are shared by default with the Mojostreet community. However, you can choose to restrict the visibility of your check-in related information to your friends only.
Sharing with partners and authorities
Mojostreet works closely with its partners in order to provide discounts and other offers to you through Mojostreet ’s service. Mojostreet may choose to share your personal information with its partners for the potential benefit of customers.
We may release personal information when we believe in good faith that it is necessary in order to comply with the law of the land, to enforce our terms of use or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Mojostreet , our employees, our users, or others.

You have the right to decline to submit personally identifiable information through the service. If you choose to do so, Mojostreet may not be able to provide certain services to you. You may update or correct your account information [and email preferences] at any time by logging in to your account. Currently your check-ins have two privacy settings. By default, check-ins are shared with everyone. You may choose to share a check-in with only your friends at the time of check-in and bypass the default setting.
How Is Information Removed From My Account?
Even after you remove information from your account or profile, copies of that information may remain viewable elsewhere, to the extent it has been shared with others, it was otherwise distributed pursuant to your privacy settings, or it was copied or stored by other users.
