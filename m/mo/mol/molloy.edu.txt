Introduction
Thank you for visiting the Molloy College Web site. This Web site is designed to make it easier and more efficient for individuals and businesses to interact with Molloy College. The College recognizes that it is critical for all audiences to be confident their privacy is protected when they visit Molloy's Web site.
Molloy College employs various measures to protect the security of its computing resources and of users’ accounts.  Users should be aware, however, that Molloy College cannot guarantee such security.  Users should therefore establish appropriate access restrictions for their accounts, guarding passwords and changing them regularly.
Users should also be aware that use of Molloy College’s computing resources is not completely private.  While Molloy College does not routinely monitor individual usage of its computing resources, the normal operation and maintenance of its computing resources require the backup and caching of data and communications, the logging of activity, the monitoring of usage patterns, and other such activities that are necessary for the rendition of service.  Molloy College may specifically monitor the activity and accounts of individual users of its computing resources, including individual login sessions and communications, without notice, when (a) the user has voluntarily made them accessible to the public, as by posting to Usenet or a web page; (b) it reasonably appears necessary to do so to protect the integrity, security or functionality of Molloy College or other computing resources or to protect Molloy College from liability; (c) there is reasonable cause to believe that the user has violated, or is violating, this policy; (d) an account appears to be engaged in unusual or unusually excessive activity, as indicated by the monitoring of general activity and usage patterns; or (e) it is otherwise required or permitted by law.  Any such individual monitoring, other than that specified in (a), required by law, or necessary to respond to perceived emergency situations, must be authorized in advance by Molloy College’s Web Developer.
Molloy College, in its discretion, may disclose the results of any such general or individual monitoring, including the contents and records of individual communications, to appropriate College personnel or law enforcement agencies and may use those results in appropriate College disciplinary proceedings.
Consistent with the provisions of New York's Internet Security and Privacy Act, Freedom of Information Law and Personal Privacy Protection Law, and applicable federal laws, this policy describes Molloy's privacy practices regarding information collected from users of this Web site. This policy describes what information is collected and how that information is used.

If you choose not to participate in these activities, your ability to receive specific services or products through this Web site may be limited, but it will not prevent you from requesting some of our services by other means, nor will it affect your ability to take advantage of other features of the Web site, including browsing or downloading publicly available information.
The New York State Internet Security and Privacy Act
The collection of information through this Web site and the disclosure of that information are subject to the provisions of the state's Internet Security and Privacy Act. Molloy will collect or disclose personal information through this Web site only if you have consented to the collection or disclosure of personal information. By using the Molloy Web Site, you give Molloy permission to collect, use and disclose the information you voluntarily provide.
However, Molloy may collect or disclose personal information without user consent if the collection or disclosure is: (1) necessary to perform the statutory duties of Molloy, or necessary for Molloy to operate a program authorized by law, or authorized by state or federal statute or regulation; (2) made pursuant to a court order or by law; (3) for the purpose of validating the identity of the user; or (4) of information to be used solely for statistical purposes that is in a form that cannot be used to identify any particular person.
Molloy may disclose personal information to federal or state law enforcement authorities, or use this personal information to enforce Molloy's rights against unauthorized access or attempted unauthorized access to Molloy's information technology assets.
Information Collected When You E-mail This Web Site
During your visit to this Web site you may send an e-mail to Molloy. Your e-mail address and the contents of your message will be collected. The information collected is not limited to text characters and may include audio, video, and graphic information formats included in the message.

Information Collected When You Make A Credit Card Bill Payment
If you visit this Web site to make a credit card payment on your outstanding balance, Molloy will provide a data entry screen that transmits your credit card information to the Web site of VeriSign, a credit card service provider, to process the transaction. Molloy will not receive any of your non-public, personal information. The credit card service provider "VeriSign" will forward to Molloy only that information necessary for Molloy to properly credit the payment to your account. For more information about VeriSign's treatment of your non-public personal information, see the Privacy and other policies displayed on VeriSign's Web site.
Information Utilized When You Use TAP on the Web
Molloy's TAP on the Web may be accessed via the Federal FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) on the Web or by going to the URL provided by the Molloy College Financial Aid Department on the e-mail or postcard mailed to you. Before you begin the TAP on the Web process, your identity will be authenticated based upon the non-public personal information you provide such as name, Social Security Number, date of birth, etc. The authentication process identifies who you are, provides you with a Molloy USER ID and PIN, and serves to help safeguard your non-public personal information.
If you enter Molloy's TAP on the Web via the Federal FAFSA, the information including non-public personal information, volunteered by you during the FAFSA process is pre-filled on your TAP on the Web application. This information includes your name, Social Security Number, income, marital status, et al. and that of your spouse and your parent(s). Non- public personal information you provide during the TAP on the Web process is used to determine your eligibility and award amounts under the TAP program, and to verify data. Access to this information is limited to Molloy staff that require access to perform their official duties and to staff with security access, as initiated by a designated school official.
Most of this personal information is retained indefinitely by Molloy as part of your academic record.   Your name, date of birth, and Social Security Number, however, are retained in perpetuity.
Failure to provide FAFSA with all information necessary to process your TAP on the Web application will result in an inability to process your TAP application. You may apply for TAP via a paper TAP application [available at the Molloy College Financial Aid office].
Information Collected When You Register for Workshops or Events on This Web Site
If, during your visit to this Web site, you register for a workshop or an event, the information, including personal information, volunteered by you is used by Molloy to enroll you in the workshop or event, and to provide you with your requested information. Access to this information is limited to Molloy staff who require access to perform their official duties. This information will not be collected for commercial purposes and Molloy is not authorized to sell or otherwise disclose your e-mail address for commercial purposes.
