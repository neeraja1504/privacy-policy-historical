To better serve you, we collect and store information about visitors to this website. We may ask, at certain times (purchase or order of a product, contest/sweepstakes/promotion, registering for a catalog) for you to provide information such as name, shipping/billing address, phone number, email address, credit card information, birth date, gender, age, occupation, etc. We may also maintain/retain a record of your purchases from the website.
Use of Information
We do not intend to use customer information collected through this website in any way not described here without first providing you the opportunity to opt-out of that use. We use customer information collected in conjunction with the purchase of products on this website to complete transactions and fulfill requests for services. We may also use customer information to provide a more effective and efficient customer experience. Additionally, we may use customer information to send you our newsletter and/or e-mail notifications / direct e-mail marketing. We (or third parties engaged by us) may also send you notices about products and services, promotions, contests (which may be related to the services of this website and/or other products or services provided by us), or re-order information to continue to serve you. We require strict contractual obligations from any such third party to ensure safeguards for the privacy and security of the information which are at least as restrictive as this Privacy Policy in handling your information.
Consent
By utilizing this website, you are consenting to the use of customer data as herein described, including but not limited to the processing of any personal and sensitive data included in the data you provide.
Opt-Out
We communicate with users to our services on a regular basis via email. For example, we may use your email address to confirm your request, to send you notice of payments, to send you information about changes to our products and services, and to send notices and other disclosures as required by law. When you make a purchase from us we use your information to process your order, to send an e-mail to confirm your order, and to contact you via phone, mail, or e-mail if we have any questions regarding your order. Generally, users cannot opt-out of these communications, but they will be primarily informational in nature rather than promotional. If you wish to opt-out and prefer not to receive information about additional products and services, promotions, and contests through e-mail, mail, or phone, you may do so by sending us an email at shop.privacy@moleskine.com. Please note: Such requests will be honored within ten (10) business days according to section 5(a)(4)(A)(i) of the Can-Spam Act.
