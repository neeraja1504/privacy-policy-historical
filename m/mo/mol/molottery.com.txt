Privacy Policy :: The Official Web Site of the Missouri Lottery
Your privacy is important to us. State laws and good business practices prevent us from redistributing any information that you may send to us via e-mail, by entering a Web-based (on-line) promotion form or subscribing to receive any of our print or e-publications unless the Lottery receives a valid Sunshine Law request or is subject to a valid subpoena or order of a court of competent jurisdiction.
Browsing
While you browse the Missouri Lottery's Web site, our operating system will automatically record the following information:
The Internet domain and Internet address of the computer you are using. For example, if you are connecting from an America Online account, the fact that someone who visited this Web site uses AOL as an Internet service provider will be known, but the individual e-mail address of the user will not be known;
The date and time you access our site;
The address (also referred to as the URL) of the Web site from which any page on this site was linked. For example, if you clicked on a hyperlink on the Web site for Yahoo.com to reach the Lottery's Web site, that fact is recorded. However, as discussed above, your identity remains unknown;
The type of browser being used, such as Netscape Version X.X or Internet Explorer Version X.X;
The type of operating system you use such as Macintosh, Unix or Windows; and
The pages you visit.
The information collected from our visitors helps us to personalize and continually improve your experience at Molottery.com. It also helps us to monitor traffic, respond to your requests and make improvements to the site. Our operating system does not record information about individuals.
Information we collect
In order to complete your on-line transactions and entries, we may collect information from you, including your name, postal address, phone number, birth date, e-mail address or other pieces of information deemed necessary.
Our on-line forms should always indicate the information that is required and the information that is optional--you do not have to complete any "optional" fields on a form. For us to be able to accept your on-line transactions, however, you must supply the required information.
Cookies
Definition of a "cookie": A message given to a Web browser by a Web server. The browser stores this information on your computer. The message is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from that server.
The Lottery employs cookies in order to assist you in interacting with us and to facilitate your entry or transaction. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of some of Molottery.com's most helpful features, and we recommend that you leave them turned on so that we are able to provide you with a personalized experience.
Safeguarding of collected information
The Missouri Lottery works to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. The purpose of this software is to scramble the information and render your personal or confidential information unreadable to anyone who would try to intercept it. The information collected by the Lottery in order to complete your on-line transactions or entry is not shared with third parties unless it is a valid Sunshine Law request or is subject to a valid subpoena or order of a court of competent jurisdiction. In that case, you will be notified. You always have the option of deeming the security measures to be unacceptable to you and terminating the on-line transaction or entry. It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.
E-mail addresses
In the course of normal business, the Lottery may request and obtain your e-mail address. These addresses are not redistributed to third parties unless it is a valid Sunshine Law request or is subject to a valid subpoena or order of a court of competent jurisdiction, and they are used only to respond to your inquiry or request. E-mail addresses may be gathered and aggregated in order to determine certain demographical information, such as what services or Internet Service Providers (ISPs) our customers are using. Such information will be used in the aggregate only with no isolation or identification of any particular individuals.
Links to other sites
The Lottery's Web site provides links to other Web sites. The privacy policies described here do not apply to any external sites. You must determine from such external Web site what its privacy policy is.
Other incidental information
In the course of normal business, the Lottery may obtain and analyze certain other pieces of customer information. Examples of these types of information might include your network (IP) address, your browser type, the pages and files retrieved from servers, and so forth. This information is used only in the aggregate for statistical analysis and problem determination. Particular individuals are not identified through this analysis.
The Lottery's Web site is hosted on servers administered and controlled by the State of Missouri's Office of Administration.
Missouri Sunshine Law
As a state governmental agency, the Missouri Lottery is subject to Chapter 610 of the Revised Statutes of Missouri, commonly known as the Sunshine Law. Many of our records are not subject to disclosure under the Sunshine Law (e.g., all tax records, and in some instances, drivers and motor vehicle records). However, if an appropriate request is made to this department for information that is subject to disclosure under the Sunshine Law, the department may be required to disclose the information requested, even if it may include your personally identifiable information.
