Privacy Policy
We last updated our Privacy Policy on May 4, 2018.  These updates include:
Enabling us to share your personal information with third parties for their own marketing and other business purposes, such as third party catalog cooperatives (co-ops) that manage catalog distribution for various retailers; and
Providing you an opportunity to opt out of this sharing.
This Privacy Policy explains how ModCloth collects, uses, and shares your personal information. (“Personal information” is information that identifies you or that can reasonably be linked to information that identifies you.) This policy applies when you visit our website, mobile app, official social media sites, or other online properties, (collectively "Sites"), and at our ModCloth locations in person. ModCloth recognizes that you care about how your information is used, and your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains the choices you can make about what information we share. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully.
Privacy Policy Updates
ModCloth may, at any time and without notice, modify and update this Privacy Policy by revising it on our Sites. If we make any material changes we will notify you by means of a notice on our Sites prior to the change becoming effective. Your continued use of our Sites constitutes your acceptance of any such revisions. You should therefore periodically visit this page to review the current Privacy Policy.
Information We Collect About You
We collect personal information from our customers to deliver the products and services you request and to help improve your shopping experience. The types of personal information we may collect from you can vary according to the method through which the information was acquired.

We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us, such as:

This information is used for the sole purpose of completing your request. We do not share your friend’s email information for any other purposes unless your friend creates a membership to ModCloth.  ModCloth stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of these programs. Your friend may contact us at support@modcloth.com to request that we remove your friend’s information from our database.

We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.
We use cookies for many different functions on ModCloth sites, including user authentication, our shopping cart, and to customize the user experience. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still browse our site, but your ability to use most features or areas of our site may be limited.

We use Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as HTML5 to store content information and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity use LSOs such as HTML 5 to collect and store information.
Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs.
