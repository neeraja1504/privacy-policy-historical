What information do we collect? How do we use it?
When you log in, we need to know your name and e-mail address. This allows us to identify you as the person who used the Modiphius Entertainment website and to include the details in our database for order tracking. All information we hold about you is stored with the e-mail address you used when you registered. As a store customer we may hold your shipping and billing address along with your order history. When you enter a contest or other promotional feature, or sign up for a newsletter, we may ask for your name, address and e-mail address so we can administer the contest and notify winners.  We may ask for other information such as age, location or your preferences in relation to games and other merchandising.  This information is used to personalise our services to you and to create aggregate reports. The reports will not contain any personally identifying information. We also monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage to help us improve the design and layout of the service. We may provide your details to legal bodies such as HMRC on their request to maintain our legal compliance. We may also use the information we collect to occasionally notify you about important functionality changes to the website, and new services that we may offer. If you would rather not receive this information you may opt out by using the unsubscribe link in the e-mail.
How does Modiphius Entertainment protect customer information?
Whenever you provide your details we use a secure server. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us, our cloud services or payment providers. Furthermore, as required by the UK Data Protection Legislation and new EU Data Protection law, we follow strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of information that you have given us, to prevent unauthorised access. Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we are able to disclose sensitive information to you.
What about "cookies"?
Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer’s hard drive. Our cookies enable us to provide features such as making it easier to recall your profile details from our secure databases. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that. Even without a cookie, you can still use most of the features in our service, including amending your Profile.
In particular we use cookies to help us show you the prices of our products in the most relevant currency we can. By using our website, you agree to allow third parties to process your IP address, in order to determine your location for the purpose of the currency conversion. You also agree to have that currency stored in a session cookie in your browser (a temporary cookie which gets automatically removed when you close your browser). We do this in order for the selected currency to remain selected and consistent when browsing our website so that the prices can convert to your (the visitor) local currency.
Will Modiphius disclose the information it collects to outside parties?
Modiphius Entertainment may provide aggregate statistics about the users of the Modiphius Entertainment webstore, sales, traffic patterns and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information. We may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mails, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analysing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments and providing customer services. Such companies and individuals will have access only to personal information needed to perform these functions, but may not use it for any other purposes and are required to process the data in accordance with the UK and EU's Data Protection legislation.
