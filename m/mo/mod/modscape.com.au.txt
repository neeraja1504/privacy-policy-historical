All personal information is securely stored at all times by us or an authorised external service provider and only authorised people will have access to the above documents and information. Personal information we collect will not be disclosed overseas.

We are committed to maintaining your privacy and we will only use your personal information for a permitted purpose for which we have collected the information.
You have the option of not identifying yourself or using a pseudonym when dealing with us, unless we believe it is impracticable to do so in the circumstances. If you wish to deal with us in this manner, you must tell us in writing so that we can consider if your request is practicable.
4. How we may share your information
If necessary to provide our services, we may need to disclose your personal information to external service providers (such as information technology service providers, legal service providers, mailing houses etc.). These external service providers are strictly prohibited from using your personal information for any purpose other than the purpose for which you have given us your personal information. Otherwise, we will only share your personal information in accordance with your express consent and instructions, as provided through the exclusions set out in the Australian Privacy Principles. We do not supply our database information to other marketing organisations not acting on our behalf.

There is no application fee for making a request to access your personal information.
