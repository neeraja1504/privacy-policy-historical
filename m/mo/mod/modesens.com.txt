Information that you provide in this way may be used for billing and accounting purposes, for recording products and services that you have licensed, bought, or downloaded, and to fill your orders. ModeSens may use this contact information to communicate about orders, products, services, or fees or charges.
ModeSens may use an outside shipping company to ship orders and uses a credit card processing company to process payments for goods and services. These companies have access to user information in order to perform their functions.
ModeSens may partner with other third parties to provide specific goods or services.

The Site may allow you to contribute to one or more blogs or communicate by means of online functions.
Nothing requires you to disclose your identity to others. If you choose to disclose your identity to third parties using any Site function or service, you do so at your own risk. ModeSens is not responsible for the privacy or security of any information, personal or otherwise, that you may choose to communicate or exchange using the functionality of the Site.
Each item of information or any materials you contribute for such purposes are your “Public Content.” Public Content must be content and information that you have a right to disclose and transfer and must not violate any other person’s privacy or intellectual property rights.
ModeSens has feedback functionality on the Site that allows you to submit comments, suggestions, or bugs found. ModeSens may collect your name or username and email address in order to follow up with you or thank you for a suggestion.
ModeSens may share aggregated demographic and usage information with its partners and advertisers. This aggregated information is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person, such as names and email addresses.

This privacy policy applies only to information collected on this Site.
ModeSens will not sell, share, or rent information obtained on this Site other than as discussed in this privacy policy.
Personal information you provided on ModeSens will be private and will not be visible to others. Closet information including product likes, wants, and pictures will not be shared by default. You may make this information public so that ModeSens can use your closet information for promotion inside or outside ModeSens by changing your closet setting in your profile. If you do not wish to share closet information to public or any other party, you can set your closet as private in profile setting.
ModeSens may be sold, might sell, or buy businesses or assets of businesses, or ModeSens might merge with another business. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the event that ModeSens, a line of business of ModeSens, or substantially all the assets of ModeSens are transferred, customer information may well be one of the transferred assets. ModeSens will make reasonable effort to provide notice on the Site and to notify you via email to the most recent email address that you have provided to ModeSens of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.
ModeSens may release information concerning your use of ModeSens (including, but not limited to, posted Public Content, registration information, and network records) when it believes in good faith that such release is appropriate to comply with the law (for example, pursuant to a statutory demand, subpoena, warrant or court order), to protect against fraudulent, abusive or unlawful use of the ModeSens, to protect ModeSens's rights or property, enforce any contract between you and ModeSens, or if ModeSens reasonably believes that a situation involving danger of death or injury to any person requires disclosure.
We do not track you over time and across third-party websites or other online services for any purpose. Some web browsers permit you to broadcast a signal to websites and online services indicating a preference that they “do not track” your online activities. At this time, we do not honor such signals and we do not modify what information we collect or how we use that information based upon whether such signal is broadcast or received.
Residents of the State of California, under the California Civil Code, have the right to request from companies conducting business in California a list of all third parties to which the Company has disclosed personal information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes and a disclosure of the shared information. Alternatively, the law provides that if the company has a privacy policy that provides you with an “opt-out” choice for use of your personal information by third parties for marketing purposes, the Company may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options.
This Site qualifies for the alternative option. Its privacy policy provides you with information on how you may opt-out from the use of your personal information by third parties for direct marketing purposes. Therefore, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received your personal information during the preceding year for marketing purposes.
If you are a California resident and request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices, send a request to the following email address: info@modesens.com.

Withdrawal of Consent. To the extent that our processing of your Personal Data is based on your consent, you may withdraw your consent at any time by closing your account. Withdrawing your consent will not, however, affect the lawfulness of the processing based on your consent before its withdrawal, and will not affect the lawfulness of our continued processing that is based on any other lawful basis for processing your Personal Data.
Right to be Forgotten. You have the right to request that we delete all of your Personal Data. We cannot delete your Personal Data except by also deleting your user account, and we will only delete your account when we no longer have a lawful basis for processing your Personal Data or after a final determination that your Personal Data was unlawfully processed.

If you contact us to exercise any of the foregoing rights, we may ask you for additional information to verify your identity. We reserve the right to limit or deny your request if you have failed to provide sufficient information to verify your identity or to satisfy our legal and business requirements.
We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal data from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure.
The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal data transmitted to our Sites. Any transmission of personal data is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Site.
ModeSens will retain your personal data for the entire time that you keep your account open. After you close your account, we may retain your personal data:
for as long as necessary to comply with any legal requirement;
on our backup and disaster recovery systems in accordance with our backup and disaster recovery policies and procedures;
for as long as necessary to protect our legal interests or otherwise pursue our legal rights and remedies; and
for data that has been aggregated or otherwise rendered anonymous in such a manner that you are no longer identifiable, indefinitely.
If ModeSens decides to change its privacy policy, ModeSens will post those changes on ModeSens’s Site so ModeSens’s users can remain aware of what information ModeSens collects, how ModeSens uses it, and under what circumstances, if any, ModeSens discloses it.
