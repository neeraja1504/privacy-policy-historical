Like many Web sites on the Internet, we automatically track certain information about you as you visit and use our Site(s) to help us (i) better understand, improve and modify the Site(s), (ii) better understand how the Site(s) are used and experienced, and (iii) better understand how we can enhance your or others overall experience on one or more of the Site(s), including providing advertising and other information that is relevant to you.

This automatically gathered data includes information provided through the use of "cookies" (described in more detail below).
Information from Cookies:
When you visit our Site(s), we may send a small file to your computer (a “cookie”) which is stored there so that we can recognize your computer as a unique machine the next time you visit the Site(s), and which also enables us to, among other things, to tailor the Site(s) to your’s and other Customers’ needs.

Additionally, some of our third-party service providers working on our behalf may also utilize their own cookies.

Clear GIFs perform administrative functions (but without detracting from your online experience), including being used to perform statistical and administrative tasks such as measuring Site and page traffic and verifying advertising avenues and positioning images on the web. However, please note that clear GIFs do not collect Personal Information.
HOW YOUR INFORMATION IS USED AND SHARED
The use and sharing of information about you depends on the context in which it is collected. Please see the categories below that relate to the features and functionality of the Site(s) that you wish to utilize.
Personal Information: We may share the Personal Information we collect from you only with your consent or under the following circumstances: User-Requested Services and Information: For information, features, products and services offered and/or provided by the Site(s), the information you submit is used by us to provide the information, feature, product or service you've requested, including being used for internal purposes such as tracking your order, analyzing your preferences, and noting trends and statistics. We may also share this information with others, but Personal Information will be shared by us only to fulfill your request or to facilitate your use of the information, features, products or services, or as otherwise outlined in this Privacy Policy. When sharing Personal Information in such a manner, we may also share your Internet Protocol (IP) address. In addition, we may use and share any registration information that you submit as described in the “Registration Information” section below.
We may use other companies and individuals (1) to perform supporting functions for the various tools, functionality, information, products and services offered on or through our Sites on our behalf, (2) to perform or support various tasks or initiatives instrumental to the business of, or related to operating or improving, the Sites or (3) to assist us in testing, maintaining or improving the features, content or effectiveness of the Sites or in performing research or development.

You typically can tell when information, features, products or services are marketed or offered jointly or in coordination with a third party because a page or area of the Sites often will display the third party's logo and/or name (whether or not along with our own), may describe or reference the relationship between Moddeals.com and the third party, or may be set up so that you can contact or be linked to the third party or its Web site to initiate, complete or learn more about the transaction. Please be aware that each third party we do business with has its own policies regarding its use, sharing and protection of information about you and that such policies may differ from those outlined in this Privacy Policy. You are responsible for and should familiarize yourself with any such policies of these third parties.
User-Initiated Communication: From time to time, portions of the Site(s) may enable you to send email and other types of messages to us or to third parties and to participate in blogs and other discussion groups.

Whenever you choose to initiate these kinds of communication with us, or anyone else, you may be contacted in return.

Please use your own discretion when deciding whether and what to post and whom to contact. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to edit or delete postings from our Site(s), blogs, and discussion groups. This reservation of rights shall not under any circumstances obligate us to conduct such edits or deletions, nor shall it cause us to be liable for any such edits or deletions.

If applicable, this Personal Information may also be shared among the Sites to make use of the Sites more convenient by, for example, limiting the number of times you have to register with us.

HOW IS PERSONAL INFORMATION PROTECTED?
Whenever Personal Information is stored on our computers (which may be for an indefinite period, or a more limited time based on obsolescence or other factors), that information is protected from unauthorized access or use by way of passwords or other industry-acknowledged means. In addition, servers of ours that store this information are located behind a firewall. Since certain Personal Information is especially sensitive, we take special care to keep it secure. We will only electronically transmit or ask for this information over secure Internet connections using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption and/or VPN (Virtual Private Network) encryption, each of which is an accepted standard for online security, and security keys. In addition, we require password authentication from any third parties you have authorized to receive this information. Finally, to the extent that we may ask for and will store for a period of time Personal Information consisting of your credit card number or financial information, this information will be stored on secure designated servers where access is limited to individuals in departments charged with using such information only in connection with processing your orders and/or payment for products and services purchased; provided, however, that those orders and/or payments processed by our business partners, marketing allies and/or service providers that provide or participate in providing the services or products requested or that participate in the payment processes related to such may store such information on their servers which are governed by such third party’s privacy policy and security procedures.
Of course, we appreciate your help in safeguarding the integrity of your own and others' privacy. We hope you'll use common sense whenever you disclose Personal Information over the Internet. Just as importantly, we encourage you to let us know immediately if you suspect that Personal Information you share with us is being used in any way contrary to this Privacy Policy. Finally, unfortunately no data transmission over the Internet nor any storage of information on servers or other media can be guaranteed or made to be 100% secure; and while we strive to protect Personal Information, as outlined in this Privacy Policy, we cannot promise, guarantee or warrant the complete security of information. To contact us, please send an email to customercare@moddeals.com.
