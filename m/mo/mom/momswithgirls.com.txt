Overview
This Privacy Statement does not govern privacy practices associated with offline activities, websites other than the Site, or products and services not available or enabled via the Site, except as expressly set forth in Section 4 (Links to Other Sites).

Because we continue to develop the Site and take advantage of technologies to improve the services we provide, our policies will change over time. We encourage you to refer to this Privacy Statement frequently to stay aware of our most current privacy policy practices. Any changes that we make to the Privacy Statement will be made in accordance with Section 9 (Privacy Statement Updates).

1. Information We Collect
Except as disclosed in this Privacy Statement, we do not sell or disclose information that identifies our users of the Site personally or makes it possible for other parties to contact them directly (“Personal Information”). We also collect non-personal information (“Anonymous Information”), such as pages visited, on the Site. We may also collect or develop aggregated information, which may include Anonymous Information and Personal Information, provided that such information does not personally identify you or any of our other users (“Aggregated Information”).
a. A Note Concerning Children
We do not intentionally gather Personal Information about users who are under the age of 13.
b. Voluntarily Provided Information
As a visitor to the Site, you can engage in many activities without providing any Personal Information. However, when you register on the www.MomsWithGirls.com site or apply to join the Moms With Girls Publishing Network, we will collect and retain information about you, some of which is Personal Information. For example, registration on the www.MomsWithGirls.com site requires you to provide a valid email address, username, and password. This email address will only be used and disclosed in accordance with this Privacy Statement. The rest of the information you provide in your user profile will be visible to others, including anonymous visitors to the Site. If you provide us feedback or contact us via email, we will collect your name and email address, as well as any other content included in the email, in order to send you a reply. When you participate in one of our surveys or contests, we may collect additional profile information. When you post content (text, images, photographs, messages, comments or any other kind of content that is not your email address) on our Site, the information contained in your posting will be stored on our servers and other users will be able to see it. We may also collect Personal Information, such as demographic information, from you at other points on our Site that state that Personal Information is being collected. In addition, you may choose to provide us with additional information, including but not limited to, marital status, household income, education and employment status.
(i) Email Newsletters. If you subscribe to any Moms With Girls newsletter, you will be required to provide a valid email address as well as any other information that is relevant to the newsletter.
(ii) Surveys and Polls. Moms With Girls offers online surveys and questionnaires that ask users for opinions on various issues and/or other information. Occasionally, we may request demographic information (like zip code, age or gender) when you answer a survey. Such surveys are completely voluntary.
(iii) Sweepstakes and Contests. We regularly operate sweepstakes, contests and giveaways throughout the Site. We generally ask you for your email address and/or home number (to notify you if you win, or not). We may also ask for first and last names, and sometimes post office addresses to verify the entrant’s identity. In some situations, we may need additional information as part of the entry process, such as a prize selection choice. These sweepstakes and contests are completely voluntary. We recommend you read the rules for each sweepstakes and contest you enter.
(iv) Moms With Girls Publishing Network. If you apply to become a member of the Moms With Girls Publishing Network, we will also ask you for certain demographic, education, legal and other information.
c. Cookies
In order to improve our services and the Site and to provide more convenient, relevant experiences to our users, we and our advertisers and agents may use “cookies,” including “cross domain cookies,” single-pixel GIFs, and similar devices to track your activities. A “cookie” is a small amount of data that is transferred to your browser by a web server and can only be read by the server that gave it to you. It functions as your identification card and enables Moms With Girls to record your passwords and preferences. It cannot be executed as code or deliver viruses. A “cross domain cookie” Is a cookie that allows Moms With Girls, its advertisers and agents to track your activities across the domains that you visit. A “single-pixel GIF” is a small transparent gif image that is embedded in an HTML page or email used to track when the page or email has been viewed. A similar device may be used by which a service may send data to a server when a set of user-initiated events occur. This device is similar to a cookie in that it tracks your visit and the data can only be read by the server that receives the data. It is different than a cookie in that it is not browser-based, may not function as an identification card, and does not store any data on your computer. While Moms With Girls uses cookies, single-pixel GIFs and similar devices to track your use of the Site and other sites (such as the number of downloads, how many users we receive daily, the Site pages visited), and web servers automatically log the Internet Protocol address of your computer (“IP Address”), Moms With Girls does not use this information to identify you personally. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies and most services that include similar devices are typically initially activated to collect data. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. (For some web pages that require an authorization, cookies are not optional. Users choosing not to accept cookies or similar devices will probably not be able to access those pages or the related services). Moms With Girls may also collect Anonymous Information, including IP Addresses, about your online activities and share this information with one or more third parties for use in tailoring ads to users on the Site and on third party sites and in analyzing and reporting on the advertising that you see. As a part of our commitment to respect privacy concerns, we will, and we will require such third parties to, provide users with the ability to opt out of such use. To opt-out of behavioral advertising, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative web site at www.networkadvertising.org.
d. Click Tracking
As is true of most websites, Moms With Girls gathers certain information automatically and stores it in log files. This information includes IP Addresses, browser type, internet service provider (“ISP”), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users’ movements around the Site and gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. Except as noted in this Privacy Statement, we do not link this automatically-collected data to Personal Information.
e. IP Addresses
Your IP Address is a number that is assigned by your ISP(ISP) to your computer to identify its location. Each user’s IP Address is logged with each visit and each action performed on the Site. This information is never provided to the third parties, except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Statement, and is logged only for a temporary period of time.
f. Advertising
If there is advertising on the Site, such advertising may employ the use of cookies or other methods to track hits and click-throughs. If you click on these advertisements, these companies may place a persistent cookie on your computer which may allow them to display further advertisements to you. We are not responsible for advertiser cookies or how the information gathered through their use might be used. For more information about these companies’ separate privacy policies, you should contact the company directly. Should you have any complaints about the privacy practices of any of these companies, you should contact Privacy Office.
g. Participation on a Public Website
