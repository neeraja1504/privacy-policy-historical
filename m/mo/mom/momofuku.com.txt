California Privacy Rights
Under California law, California residents who have provided personally identifiable information to a company may have the right to request a list of all third parties to whom that company had disclosed such information for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year, along with a list of the categories of Personal Information that had been so disclosed. However, Momofuku’s policy, as disclosed on this Website, does not currently permit Momofuku to share the Personal Information collected at this Website about you with non-affiliated third parties for such third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Moreover, even if Momofuku’s policy permitted the disclosure of Personal Information to third parties for such third parties’ direct marketing purposes, because Momofuku provides you with an opportunity to opt out of such disclosure, Momofuku does not have to provide you with such lists. If you are a California resident who would like information on how to exercise your rights concerning third party disclosures, you may send an email to or contact us via postal mail at:
