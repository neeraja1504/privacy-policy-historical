Privacy Policy・Momentum
Privacy Policy
We at Momentum are committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy applies to our browser extension (Momentum), our website (https://momentumdash.com), any subdomains of momentumdash.com, and our help website (https://momentumdash.help).
The information we gather or process is used solely for core functionality of Momentum and to improve the quality and security of our service. Your information isn’t and has never been sold to third parties.
What information is being stored, or accessed?
Momentum account information
Your name, email, account settings, and extension data (such as to-dos and links) are transferred and stored securely, solely for your usage within our extension and not shared with any other third parties, except as specified in this policy.
Payment information
To upgrade to Momentum Plus, your credit card number, credit card expiration date, security code, name, country and postal code are required. All payment processing is done through a PCI compliant third party (Stripe, Inc.). When paying by a credit card, the card details do not pass through our servers, they are sent directly to Stripe and are stored securely, as per their Privacy and Security policies.
To perform requested changes to or inquiries about your Momentum Plus account (cancelling, refunding, or changing payment details), authorized members of Momentum’s support team could potentially view payment-related information contained in Stripe’s databases (this is limited to billing name, billing address, postal code, the last four digits of credit card(s), and credit card expiry date(s)) while accessing subscription information via Stripe’s payment dashboard. This information will only be accessed upon your request.
Data accessible through WebExtensions API
WebExtension APIs used within Chrome Extensions and Firefox Add-ons have fine-grained permission levels that are enforced by the Web Browser, restricting information that our extension has access to within your Browser. The Momentum extension can only access specific information that you have explicitly granted permission for. We can not and do not track your browsing history.
Additional optional permissions may be requested when you enable specific features. When you enable a feature that requests an optional permission, your Web Browser will make it clear what permission(s) are being requested. The feature will be accessible once you choose to allow the requested permission(s).
Information/Permission | Feature | Where it is used | Optional
---|---|---|---
Location | Weather | Location could be sent to our weather provider API to determine your closest weather station. At no time is your physical location retrieved from your web browser stored in any way that could be correlated to your Momentum account. | No
Bookmarks and most visited websites | Bookmarks Bar | Used only within the Extension to display a Bookmarks Bar. This is not sent or stored elsewhere. | Yes
You can prevent your location and/or IP address from being sent to directly to our third-party weather provider by turning off the Weather app (Settings → General → Toggle Weather). Alternatively, with the Momentum Plus advanced Weather app, your location is sent only to our servers to retrieve current weather information.
Feature usage data
To improve the content, features and overall experience of the extension, we gather and log data on how our users access and use Momentum Dashboard. For example, we may log actions like clicking on a photo source, favoriting a quote, or completing a to-do (not the content of the to-do, just the action of completing it).
Some of this usage data is sent to Google Analytics. In these cases, we do not send any identifying information that could be correlated with your account. We also make use of their IP anonymization feature to prevent your IP from being associated with your usage data.
What vendors/sub-processors do you use?
We use several vendors/sub-processors to conduct various aspects of our business.

Unsplash | Some photos/backgrounds are retrieved from Unsplash. A request is made from your IP address to download photos.
