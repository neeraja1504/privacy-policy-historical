General Statement of Privacy
ACT | The App Association respects the privacy of its members and of those who visit this site. Subject to the provisions of applicable laws, any information you submit to the ACT will not be used in any manner to which you have not consented.
Personally Identifiable Information
We do not collect Personally Identifiable Information about you on momswithapps.com without your knowledge or action. Personally Identifiable Information is collected through the membership registration form, e-mail newsletter registration, legislator contact and/or other forms. This information includes, but is not limited to your e-mail address and zip code. You should be aware that if you disclose any information on an open forum that is hosted by the ACT, others may collect that information to send you unsolicited information from outside the ACT, or for other purposes.
Use of Personally Identifiable Information
It is our general policy not to make Personally Identifiable Information available to anyone other than our employees, staff, and agents. We will never sell your e-mail address or other Personally Identifiable Information.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information
Non-Personally Identifiable Information includes, but is not limited to, information we automatically collect on your use and/or actions on our Web site (e.g., user traffic patterns, page views on the Web site, click-through rates, search terms that users enter into our search utility). In addition, when a visitor arrives at our site, we collect the IP address, operating system, and browser software used. An IP address (which is not the same as an e-mail address) can tell us the user’s internet service provider and, based on that, can suggest the geographic location of the connection. ACT recognizes that certain user information of a key demographic nature (e.g., race, age, gender, national origin, income), while Non-Personally Identifiable Information, is still of a sensitive nature to users.
As a general matter, the ACT does not collect demographic information about you through regular use of momswithapps.com. However, in recognition of the sensitive nature of such information, in the event the ACT comes into possession of such information, whether through your voluntary submission of such information in response to a special feature on the Web site or by receiving such information from any of our business partners, such information shall, when coupled with any of your Personally Identifiable Information, itself be deemed to be Personally Identifiable Information and treated by the ACT as such.
Use of Non-personally identifiable information
As a general matter, Non-Personally Identifiable Information helps us determine how the momswithapps.com is being used, helps us identify popular areas of the Web site, and helps determine the effectiveness of our promotional activities regarding the Web site. In some cases it may be shared with a third party contracted by the ACT in the course of doing so.
