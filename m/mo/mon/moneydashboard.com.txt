Information Which We May Collect
You do not have to supply any information simply to visit the site.
To register to use our service you will have to supply us with personal information. “Personal Information” means information that identifies you. The personal information we collect to register you is your e-mail address. In order to add your financial accounts, you will also need to provide your UK postcode and date of birth, and choose a secure question and answer. If you use our functionality to refer a friend, we will collect their email address from you. We store this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact us at support@moneydashboard.com to request that we remove this information from our database. Once you have aggregated accounts with us (see “Other people who have to be able to access your information” below for an explanation) , we will have access to that account information.

How we use your information
We will use the personal information which we collect for the purposes of registering you as a User of our services, correspondence, or participating in online surveys to help us enhance our services and products for you, and to send a one-time email to your friends about our site upon your request.
We also ask for personal information at the point at which you add a financial account to enable us to ask security related questions if you later ask us to reset your password.
In addition, through a computer system-run process, we will use your personal information and information from your account aggregation for the purposes of analysing it and making suggestions which may enable you to make savings or consider alternative or additional products to the ones which you are using. These suggestions can be delivered either in the service or by way of email or text messages to you. This may involve us sending limited details about you (which will not identify you) to our partners so that we can tailor suggested products for you more accurately.
Any information we collect is used to improve the content of the site, enhance Users' experiences when visiting our site, and customise the content and/or layout of our pages.
We also use personal information in performing statistical analysis of Users’ behaviour as a whole; and to help in the creation of anonymised statistical data which we may use at our discretion (including licensing to third parties).
