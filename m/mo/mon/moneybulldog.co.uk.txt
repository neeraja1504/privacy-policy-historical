Even if we delete your personal information it may persist on back-up or archival media for legal, tax or regulatory purposes.
7. How are we keeping your personal information secure?
Keeping information about you secure is very important to us so we store and process your personal information in accordance with the high standards required under data protection legislation. All personal information we collect is encrypted and stored in the UK. From time to time and for operational reasons the personal information we collect from you may be transferred to and stored in countries outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”). Your information may also be processed by some of our service providers which operate outside the EEA. Different countries have different data protection and security laws and some of these do not offer the same level of protection as you enjoy under UK data protection legislation. However, when we appoint our service providers to help us provide products and services to you (which may include some based in the USA), we take care to ensure that they have appropriate security measures in place and utilise data centers in the UK wherever possible.
You may complete a registration process when you sign up to use parts of our Site. This may include the creation of a username, password and/or other identification information. Any such details should be kept confidential by you and should not be disclosed to or shared with anyone. Where you do disclose any of these details, you are solely responsible for all activities undertaken on our Site where they are used. To protect your account, we ask you to choose a strong password to access your data on our Site. A strong password should include a mixture of letters and numbers. This password must be unique and must not be used anywhere else or for any other purpose. Your password can only be reset with access to the email address registered in our system.
We do our best to keep the information you disclose to us secure. However, we can’t guarantee its security. By using our Site you accept the inherent risks of providing information online and will not hold us responsible for any breach of security.
