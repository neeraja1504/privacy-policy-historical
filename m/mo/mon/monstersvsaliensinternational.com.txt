Privacy Policy
LAST UPDATED: May 7, 2014
DreamWorks Animation SKG, Inc. (" DreamWorks ") and its subsidiaries are concerned about privacy issues and want you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose information. This Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with the DreamWorks mobile application (" App ") or website through which you are accessing this Privacy Policy, as well as in connection with HTML-formatted email messages that we send to you and that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the " Services "). By using the Services or by providing your consent to your child's use of the Services, you agree to this Privacy Policy. If you provide your consent to your child's use of the Services, your child is an "eligible user." Users who are not children are also "eligible users."
Collection of Information
We and our service providers may collect the following information from users of the Services:
Parent's Email Address. A child user may submit the email address of his or her parent or guardian. We use the email address to seek the consent of the parent or guardian to the child's use of the Services. We may also use the email address to invite the parent or guardian to create a family account or otherwise interact with us.
Device and Activity Information. We collect persistent identifiers, including cookies and device identifiers, that provide us with information � such as website, game or App usage � that we use solely to support our internal operations. For example, we may use IP addresses for such purposes as to calculate play or use levels, diagnose problems and administer a game, App or the Services, and we may use pixel tags (also known as web beacons or clear GIFs) in our emails to determine the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.
We and our service providers may also collect the following information from eligible users of the Services:
Profile Information. An eligible user may submit the following information to create a profile: name, email address, address, phone number, gender, preferred language and display name. We also collect a user name and password to permit an eligible user to access and interact with the Services. In addition, we may collect an adult's payment card and related information in order to permit him or her to make purchases.
Photos, Videos and Audio files.
Location Information. If a user plays through an App or mobile site, we may collect the physical location of the user's mobile device by, for example, using satellite, cell phone tower or WiFi signals, in order to provide location-based services and content, such as to permit interactive game play with real world environments.
Unique Identifier for Push Notifications. We may collect a unique identifier assigned to the device used to play an App in order to deliver push notifications to an eligible user.
We may combine the information we collect from eligible users with information that we receive from other DreamWorks and third party online and offline sources.
Use and Disclosure
We use the information we collect from and about a user to provide the Services to him or her, including to measure and improve the Services and its features; to improve the user's experience by delivering relevant content, including advertising and, if the user has agreed, marketing messages; to allow the user to participate in contests or other promotions; to provide the user with customer support; and to respond to requests and inquiries. When the information collected from or about a user does not identify him or her, or allow contact with him or her or his or her device, we may use that information for any purpose or share it with third parties, to the extent permitted by applicable law.
We use and disclose the information we collect from and about users for these additional purposes:
For our internal business purposes. We use users' information for our internal business purposes, such as data analysis; audits; fraud prevention; improving or modifying our services; identifying usage trends; determining the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns; and operating our business.
To our service providers. We may disclose users' information to our service providers who assist us in providing and managing our services, such as by providing data analysis, payment processing, information technology, customer service, email delivery, auditing and other services.
To contact the user. We may periodically send notifications or reminders related to the Services to an eligible user or parent. We may also send promotional materials to an eligible user by email and/or direct mail, if he or she has agreed to receive them.
To protect our rights and those others. We may use or disclose a user's information, consistent with applicable law, when we believe such disclosure is necessary or appropriate: (a) under applicable law; (b) to comply with legal process; (c) to respond to requests from public and government authorities; (d) to enforce our terms and conditions; (e) to protect our operations or those of any of our affiliates; (f) to protect our rights, privacy, safety or property and/or that of our affiliates, a user of the Services or others; and (g) to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.
In connection with a disposition of our assets. We may disclose a user's information, consistent with applicable law, in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings).
Third Party Services
This Privacy Policy does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy, information or other practices of any third parties, including any third party operating any site or service to which the Services link. The inclusion of a link in the Services does not imply endorsement of the linked site or service by us or by our affiliates.
Security
We seek to use reasonable organizational, technical and administrative measures to protect personal information within our organization. Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. If you have reason to believe that your or your child's interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us in accordance with the " Contacting Us " section below.
