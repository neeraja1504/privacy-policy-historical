When you order Services on our Site, you will be directed to our credit card processor, which will collect all information necessary to complete the transaction, including your name, credit card information and billing information. This information will be shared with third parties who help process your purchases. When you submit credit card numbers, the information is encrypted using industry standard technology.

Log Files. As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.
