This Privacy Policy applies to information collected from or about you on the Websites, through email and other electronic messages between you and the Websites, and when you interact with our advertising on third-party websites, if that advertising includes links to this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information that may be collected by us offline or through any other means, including on any other websites operated by us or any third parties (including our affiliates). This Policy also does not apply to information collected by any third party, including through any application or content (including advertising) that may link to or be accessible from the Website. Certain transactions and services offered while visiting the Websites may be processed or provided by service providers and other strategic partners, even though it appears that you may not have left the Website (e.g., reservations, payment processing, hosting). Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how we will treat it.

Types of Information We Collect and How We Collect It
We collect various types of information from and about you on the Websites, including:
“Personally Identifiable information” or “personal information,” which is information by which you may be personally identified or contacted, such as your first and last name, email address, postal address, billing address, telephone numbers (including mobile telephone numbers), credit/debit card number, or any other identifier by which you may be contacted offline or online. Personal information also may include information that is not personally identifiable standing alone (for example, your travel dates) but is when stored with personally identifiable information (for example, your travel dates together with your first and last name). Many pages on our Websites can be visited without providing any personal information. On other Website pages, you may be prompted or invited to provide certain personally identifiable information, such as to join our mailing list or to receive brochures or other promotional materials about MONTAGE-branded developments or other offers that may be of interest to you. Certain features of some Websites, such as reservations, may require credit card and billing information as well.
“Non-personal information,” which is data that is about you but which does not identify you as an individual and is not linked to your personal information. This may include information such as (i) your travel dates, birth date, nationality, gender, preferred airline, communication preferences, traveler and guest preferences, goods and services purchased, special requests made, and other preferences that require specific accommodation, and (ii) information about your Internet connection, the equipment you use to access our Websites, and usage details about your activities while using our Websites. Non-personal information also may include personal information that has been aggregated or de-identified such that it is rendered anonymous. For example, survey information that you volunteer may be de-personalized and/or aggregated such that it no longer personally identifies you, and would then be considered non-personal information. Non-personal information often is collected through the use of cookies and anonymous identifiers, pixel tags, beacons, scripts, and other similar technologies (“Other Technologies”). Click here to learn more about how these technologies are used on the Websites. Non-personal information (including anonymized information and non-personal information that is automatically collected as you navigate through and use the Websites) is not subject to this Privacy Policy, and we can use and share such information with third parties without restriction for any lawful purpose.
We collect information from and about you on or through the Websites directly from you when you provide it to us (for example, via forms that you fill out on the Websites, in emails and other communications and information that you submit via the Websites, and when you make a reservation), and automatically as you access and navigate through the Websites through the use of cookies and Other Technologies.
Personal Information You Provide To Us
The personal information we collect on or through the Websites may include:
Information you provide by filling out forms on the Websites. This includes, for example, information you provide when you make a reservation, purchase a gift card or make another purchase on the Websites, sign up to receive emails, offers or other information, email us or our properties through the Websites, submit a question or report a problem with our Websites, submit a Request for Proposal, or submit a form to plan a wedding at a Montage property.
Information you provide when you register a Montage gift card on the Websites.
Information you provide to enter and participate in sweepstakes, contests or promotional offers.
Records and copies of your correspondence, including email addresses, if you contact us, our properties or our service providers through the Websites.
Information you provide in response to surveys.
Details of transactions that you carry out through the Websites and the fulfillment of your order.
Automatically Collected Information
As you navigate through and interact with the Websites, we and our service providers may use automatic data collection technologies, such as cookies and Other Technologies, to collect certain information, including:
Information about your visits to our Websites, such as traffic data, logs, page requests, search terms, the referring page, the time, date and duration of your visits to our Websites, clickstream data, other communication data, the links that you click, your search queries, and the resources and content that you access and use on the Websites.
Information about your Internet connection and computer or other devices used to access the Websites, including your IP address, operating system or platform, browser type, mobile identifiers (such as Apple IFDA and Android Advertising ID) and the name of your Internet Service Provider.
Information about traffic patterns, number of visits to certain pages, visits from other websites or to third-party websites linked to the Website, and visitors’ use of particular services and interest in services, information or features of the Website.
The information collected automatically does not include personal information, but/ we may maintain it or associate it with personal information that you provide to us or that we collect in other ways or receive from affiliates or other third parties.
Cookies and Other Technologies
Like many other websites, our Websites may use cookies and Other Technologies to help us and third parties: obtain information about your visits to the Websites; deliver online and mobile advertisements and content for Montage and for third parties that are tailored to your apparent interests; process your reservations, purchases or requests; analyze your visiting patterns; personalize your experience on the Websites; facilitate social media functions; and engage in website and advertising analytics. “Cookies” are small text files that are stored on your computer or device when you visit a website, if your web browser or device settings permit. Some cookies are stored only temporarily during a browsing session and are deleted when you close your browser (session cookies). Other cookies are not deleted when you close your browser, but are saved on your computer or device for a fixed period of time or until you delete them (persistent cookies). Each time you visit the Websites the server that set the cookie will recognize the persistent cookie stored on your computer or device. Various types of cookies may be used on our Websites, including:
Cookies that are necessary for the Websites to work and enable you to navigate through and take advantage of our Websites and their features.
HTTP request header information in order make our Websites function correctly and to personalize content presented to you, better understand how visitors use our Websites, and how we can better meet your needs.
Cookies that determine your browser’s ability to receive HTML email messages to determine the appropriate format for you to receive and read email.
Advertising cookies that allow us and other advertisers to serve you advertisements. Some advertising cookies help us to provide you with content on the Websites that is tailored to your interests and needs. Advertising cookies also enable our service providers and other advertisers serve ads to you when you browse other websites and mobile applications that are based on your apparent interests, including those that are inferred based on your activities across websites and mobile applications and over time. Other advertising cookies may help prevent you from seeing the same ad twice.
Analytics cookies collect information about your use of the Websites and your interaction with our content and advertisements to help us better understand and improve the way that the Websites work and to track and improve our advertising campaigns. These cookies provide us with aggregated information on metrics such as the most frequently visited pages on our Websites, help us understand how our visitors reach the Websites, show us how frequently various pages of our Websites are visited, help us understand whether our advertising is effective, and allows us to see overall patterns of the usage of our website.
Social Media cookies that show social media platforms whether users are logged in to those platforms. These cookies are set by social media platforms.
Many web browsers may be initially set to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can set your web browser to refuse cookies. You may also delete cookies manually from your hard drive through your internet browser or other programs. For more information on how to manage browser cookies, see http://www.allaboutcookies.org. You also can learn more about opting out of our vendors’ and other advertisers’ use of cookies used to tailor ads and other content to you by visiting http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp and http://www.aboutads.info/choices. Click to review the Analytics and Online Tracking sections below to learn more about how to opt-out of other advertising cookies and analytics cookies. Please keep in mind that although you may disable cookies in your browser and still access and use the Websites, disabling cookies may prevent you from taking advantage of certain features on the Websites. Please also note that disabling or clearing cookies may affect cookie-based opt-outs by either preventing you from using such opt-outs or clearing cookie-based opt-outs that you previously set, in which case you would have to revisit the applicable pages and renew your opt-out after clearing cookies. Managing cookies also will not disable non-cookie technologies present on the Websites and Apps. Other Technologies also may be used on the Websites, allowing us and our third-party service providers to: track customer response to our advertisements, Website content and emails; determine our users’ ability to receive HTML-based emails and to know how many users open an email; allow our service providers to compile aggregated statistics about our email and advertising campaigns; enable us to better target advertising and provide offers and promotions that we believe may be of interest to you; and enhance customer support and the usability of our Website.
Online Tracking
“DO NOT TRACK” SIGNALS
Some web browsers may give you the ability to enable a “do not track” setting that sends a special signal to the websites you encounter while web browsing that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. These features are not yet uniform, and we do not respond to web browser “do not track” signals at this time. If we do so in the future, we will update this Privacy Policy to describe how we respond to such signals. As discussed below, we work with third-party vendors that use tracking technologies on our Websites in order to provide tailored advertisements on our behalf and on behalf of other advertisers across the Internet. These companies may collect information about your activity on our Websites and other websites over time, and use this information to determine which ads you see on third-party websites and mobile applications. For more information about these interest-based advertising practices and to understand your options, please visit the website for the Network Advertising Initiative at http://www.networkadvertising.org or the website of the Digital Advertising Alliance at http://www.aboutads.info.
INTEREST-BASED ADVERTISING
We may engage in interest-based advertising provided by vendors (such as advertising networks and ad servers) in order to deliver advertisements and personalized content that we believe will be of interest to you. These vendors typically use a cookie alone or with Other Technologies to track and collect anonymous information about your interests during your visits to our Websites and other websites and mobile applications or when you view or interact with one of the advertisements they place on various websites or on mobile platforms. These vendors use this information to make predictions about your characteristics, interests or preferences and to display advertisements across the Internet and on mobile platforms that are tailored to your apparent interests. Advertisements may be provided to you based on your online behavior (on our Websites and on third-party websites and mobile applications), or based on your search activity, your geographic location or other information. For example, if you make a reservation on the Websites, you may see an advertisement from Montage later when you visit another website or on a mobile platform. This is called retargeting. You also may see the advertisements for third parties on the Websites, on third-party websites or mobile platforms based on your visits to, and activities on, the Websites, third-party websites, and mobile platforms. To the extent that third-parties are using cookies or Other Technologies for interest-based advertising, Montage does not control the use of the technologies or the resulting information. We use Google’s Remarketing with Google AdWords to retarget users and show you our ads as you browse other websites around the Internet. The Remarketing service delivers our ads through the Google Display Network, which includes both Google.com pages and the sites of trusted publishers. Click here for more information on the types of advertising cookies that Google uses, and here for more information about how Google uses advertising cookies. Click here to read the Google privacy policy. You can opt-out of Google’s use of cookies and/or customize Google display network ads by visiting the Ads Settings at https://www.google.com/ads/preferences/. Alternatively, you can opt-out of Remarketing with Google by visiting http://www.networkadvertising.org. We also use the DoubleClick cookie in connection with Google’s Remarketing service. To learn more about DoubleClick cookies, click here. If you want to permanently opt-out of the DoubleClick cookie, you can install the DoubleClick opt-out extension by clicking here. To serve ads in our mobile applications, Google may use anonymous identifiers. These perform similar functions to cookies. To learn more about how to opt-out of interest-based advertising for your mobile device, click here. Some advertising networks are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt-out of ad targeting from member companies. To learn more about interest-based advertising generally as well as your options for opting-out, please visit http://www.networkadvertising.org or http://aboutads.info. Please keep in mind that even if you opt out of receiving ads tailored to your apparent interests, you will continue to see ads from online advertising networks. However, those networks will not be able to apply any of your apparent ad preferences and the ads that you see therefore may be less relevant to your interests.
Analytics
We engage service providers to provide us analytics data relating to use of the Websites and our advertising. These service providers may use cookies and Other Technologies alone or in conjunction with anonymous identifiers to collect information about you when you use the Websites or interact with our ads on other websites. For example, we use Google Analytics to measure and report how users interact with our Websites and advertisements for the purposes of understanding and optimizing web usage, measuring conversion tracking, measuring, enhancing and optimizing the effectiveness of our content and advertising campaigns, targeting advertising, and for other business and market research purposes. For more information about Google Analytics and how it collects and processes data, please see “How Google Uses Data When You Use Our Partners’ Sites or Apps.” For more information about how Google Analytics uses cookies to measure user interactions on websites, click here. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Websites is restricted by Google’s Terms of Service and the Privacy Policy. You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to the Websites by disabling cookies on your browser, as described above. If you do not want your Website visit data reported by the Google Analytics JavaScript, you also can install the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on. This add-on instructs the Google Analytics JavaScript to prohibit sending visit information to Google Analytics, but does not prevent information from being sent to the Website itself or in other ways to other website analytics services. Click here if you would like to learn more about the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, and click here to install the opt-out browser add-on. We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with your personal information.
