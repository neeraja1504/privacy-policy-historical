1. INTRODUCTION.
The Monterey Bay Aquarium Foundation (the "Aquarium," "we," or "us") is committed to respecting the privacy rights of our Guests—that is, our in-person and virtual visitors, members and donors. Our policy covers information we collect through the mail, over the phone, in person at the Aquarium or off site at Aquarium events and online through our websites (including through application programming interfaces), e-newsletters, e-books and mobile applications, (collectively, "Services"). We created this Privacy Policy (the "Policy") to give you confidence as you visit, join, donate, or use our Services and to demonstrate our commitment to fair information practices and the protection of privacy. We have designed our privacy policy to be easy to navigate and understand and to provide transparency into our practices and principles.
With respect to our membership and fundraising practices, we adhere to A Donor Bill of Rights, which requires that we handle all information about our Members and Donors with respect and with confidentiality to the extent provided by law. Members and Donors always have the opportunity for their names to be deleted from any lists that we may intend to share pursuant to this Policy.
2. INFORMATION COLLECTION PRACTICES.
We collect personal and anonymous information from our Guests and may use this information to create aggregate information. We may share information as further described in Section 3. The types of information we collect are described as follows ("Collected Information"):
Location Information.  When Guests access the Services virtually, we have the ability to recognize Guests' domain names, IP addresses (the number assigned to computers and mobile devices on the internet) and general physical location. No personal information about you is revealed in this process. Your IP address is used to help identify your computer and your shopping cart and to gather broad demographic information about you.
Use, Viewing and Technical Information.  The Services may also gather anonymous "traffic data" that does not personally identify you, such as which pages you visit, how you are accessing the Services (including the type of device and screen size), how long you use the Services, your preferred language, and the site you visited immediately before arriving at one of our websites. This anonymous information is used for marketing purposes, is shared with business partners and advertisers and is analyzed to help us improve the Services for our visitors.
Cookies.  From time to time, we may use the standard "cookies" feature of major browser applications. This allows us to store a small piece of data on your computer about your use of the Services such as your password being remembered or Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. We use remarketing with Google Analytics to advertise online. Third-party vendors show our ads on sites across the internet. We, and third-party vendors (including, but not limited to, Google), use first-party cookies (e.g. Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (e.g. DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on your past visits to our website to provide you with more relevant ads to your interest. Data about you from Google's Interest-based advertising or 3rd party audience data (such as age, gender and interests) may also be compiled together to allow us to view information about our audience in order to provide them with information pertinent to them. Although the cookies do not store any Personal Information you can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads using the Ads Setting. We do not set or collect any personally identifiable information through cookies, nor do we employ any data capture mechanisms other than cookies. Cookies help us learn which areas of our Services are useful and which areas need improvement. We may use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests, keep track of your shopping cart or save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you access the Services. We also track our advertisements' online performance with cookies and tracking codes. Data is collected to determine which pages Guests visit and whether purchases are made after clicking on or being exposed to our advertisements. Tracking codes allow MBA to record the path a Guest takes in navigating between and among various components of the Services. Tracking codes do not automatically store themselves as files on Guests' computers or mobile devices. Cookies do automatically store themselves on Guests' computers and mobile devices, but you can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings on your browser. However, if you choose to disable this function, your experience may be diminished and some features may not work as they were intended.
Third-Party Cookies.  Promotions or advertisements displayed through the Services may also use cookies. We do not have access to or control over information collected by outside advertisers. You may disable cookies by changing the settings on your browser.
Personal Information.  In order for you to access certain services and information, make donations and purchases, we require you to provide us with certain information that personally identifies you ("Personal Information"). Personal Information may be provided via our virtual Services as well as in person or through the mail and includes the following categories of information:

At the Aquarium, we are especially concerned with protecting the privacy of children who using our Services.

We require the consent of the parent or legal guardian of any Guest under the age of 13 before we collect or use any Personal Information.
If we collect Personal Information from children, it is only to be able to furnish information regarding participation in programs such as the Student Oceanography Club.
We do not ask children for other information, and we never share the information we collect with anyone outside of the Aquarium.
At any time, a child's parent may review the child's Personal Information, ask us to delete it and refuse to allow any further collection or use of information from the child.
You may consent to our collection of Personal Information from your child by sending us an e-mail identifying yourself and your child and authorizing us to collect personal information from your child. You can reach us via e-mail at equarist@mbayaq.org.

The Services have security measures designed to prevent the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we obtain from you. However, you should be careful about the personal information which you provide to us through the Services because we make no assurances about our ability to prevent any loss or expense to you or to any third-party arising out of any breach in our security measures. If you have established an Aquarium online account and become aware that your Guest name or password has been compromised, you must notify us immediately so that we may promptly take the appropriate measures to protect your Personal Information.
