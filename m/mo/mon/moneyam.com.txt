How we store and protect your personal data
Your data will primarily be held in the UK but there may be occasions when the data that we collect from you is transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (EEA). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. These staff may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We’ll take all steps that are reasonably necessary to ensure your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.
All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology. You are responsible for keeping confidential any password we've given you, or you have chosen, which enables you to access certain parts of the website. It’s important you don’t share a password with anyone. If you (or your representative) contact us for details of your account, we’ll ask some questions so that we can establish your (or your representative’s) identity. We won’t disclose any details unless we’re satisfied that you (or your representative) are who you claim to be.
Unfortunately, transmitting information via the internet can’t be completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we can’t guarantee the security of your data transmitted to the website; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we’ll use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access. We strongly suggest you purchase and keep up-to-date software to protect the security of your computer or device.
How long we will store your personal data for
Your data will be stored for the duration of your relationship with us. After the relationship ends, we will store your data only for as long as it’s appropriate and necessary to do so.
Your rights
You have the following rights when it comes to your data that we hold:
The right to access
You have a right to request that we provide you with a copy of the personal information on you that we hold. You also have the right to be informed of (a) the source of your personal information; (b) the purposes, legal basis and methods of processing; (c) the data controller’s identity; and (d) the entities or categories of entities your personal information may be transferred to.
The right to rectification
You have a right to request that we rectify inaccurate personal information. We may seek to verify the accuracy of the personal information before rectifying it.
The right to erasure
In limited circumstances, you can request that we erase your personal information if:
it’s no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected; or
you have withdrawn your consent (where the data processing was based on consent); or
following a successful right to object (see right to object); or
it has been processed unlawfully; or
to comply with a legal obligation to which you are subject.
We aren’t required to comply with your request to erase personal information if the processing of your personal information is necessary:
for compliance with a legal obligation; or
for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
The right to restriction of processing
You can ask us to restrict your personal information, but only where:
its accuracy is contested, to allow us to verify its accuracy; or
the processing is unlawful, but you don’t want it erased; or
it’s no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected, but we still need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or
you have exercised the right to object, and verification of overriding grounds is pending.
We can continue to use your personal information following a request for restriction, where:
we have your consent; or
to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or
to protect the rights of another natural or legal person.
The right to object to processing
You can object to any processing of your personal information which has our legitimate interests as its legal basis – providing you believe your fundamental rights and freedoms outweigh our legitimate interests.
If you raise an objection, we’ll need to demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate interests which override your rights and freedoms in order to continue processing your data.
The right to portability
You have the right to ask us to provide you with an electronic file containing all personal information we hold about you. You can give this information to other organisations if you wish to.
Right to object to how we use your personal information for direct marketing purposes
You also have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes.
You can choose the communications we send you by using the communication preferences area of our website or by using the manage preferences links in our emails. However, keep in mind you can’t opt-out of receiving regulatory or legal updates (e.g. information about a change in the product terms and conditions) by email. We regularly review our records to ensure that we only retain your personal details for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out above.
Right to obtain a copy of personal information safeguards used for transfers outside your jurisdiction
You can ask to obtain a copy of, or reference to, the safeguards under which your personal information is transferred outside of the European Union.
We may redact data transfer agreements to protect commercial terms.
Right to lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority
If you have concerns about how we’re processing your personal information, you have a right to lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority.
We ask that you please attempt to resolve any issues with us first – although you have a right to contact your supervisory authority at any time.
Access to information
Before sending you a copy of the personal information you requested, we may ask you for additional information to confirm your identity and for security purposes. We reserve the right to charge a fee where permitted by law – for instance if your request is manifestly unfounded or excessive.
You can exercise your rights by contacting us. Subject to legal and other permissible considerations, we’ll make every reasonable effort to honour your request promptly, or inform you if we require further information in order to fulfil your request.
We may not always be able to fully address your request, for example if it goes against the duty of confidentiality we owe to others, or if we’re legally entitled to deal with the request in a different way.

Any changes we may make to our privacy policy in the future will be posted on this page and, where appropriate, notified to you by email. Please note that updates to this policy are not emailed as a matter of course, so please check back frequently to see any updates or changes to our privacy policy.
