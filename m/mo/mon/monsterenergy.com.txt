How We Can Collect Other Information
We and our third party service providers can collect Other Information in a variety of ways, including:
Through your browser or device : Certain information is collected by most browsers or automatically through your device, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, operating system name and version, device manufacturer and model, device performance benchmarks and capabilities, installed plugins, mouse clicks or cursor position, page scroll position, time spent on the services, pages visited, referral pages and keywords used if coming from a search engine, language, Internet browser type and version, the name and version of the Services (such as the App) you are using, and other anonymous traffic data. We use this information to ensure that the Services function properly and to personalize your experience while using the Services.

This unique ID enables us to track your activity on our Services and to display content that we believe will interest you based on such activity.
Through your use of the App : If you download and use the App, we and our service providers track and collect App usage data, such as the date and time the App on your device accesses our servers and what information and files have been downloaded to the App.
Using cookies : Cookies are pieces of information stored directly on the computer that you are using. Cookies allow us to collect information such as browser type, time spent on the Services, pages visited, language preferences, and other anonymous traffic data. We and our service providers use the information for security purposes, to facilitate navigation, display information more effectively, and to personalize your experience while using the Services, as well as for online tracking purposes. We can recognize your computer to assist your use of the Services.

Using pixel tags and other similar technologies : Pixel tags (also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) may be used in connection with some Services to, among other things, track the actions of users of the Services (including email recipients), measure the success of our marketing campaigns and compile statistics about usage of the Services and response rates.
IP Address : Your “ IP Address ” is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). An IP Address may be identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user accesses the Services, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited.
