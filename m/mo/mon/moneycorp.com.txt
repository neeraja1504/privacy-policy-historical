The “lawful basis” we rely on to process your personal data
Data Protection Law sets out six lawful basis that organisations, businesses and governments can rely on to collect and process personal data. Moneycorp predominately relies on the following:
Consent
This means processing your personal data where you have explicitly given us permission to do so.
**Performance of a Contract  **
This means processing your personal data in order to fulfil our contractual obligations with you.
**Legal Obligations  **
This means processing your personal data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal or regulatory obligation to which we are subject.
**Legitimate Interests  **
This means processing your personal data where we or a third party have a legitimate interest to do so. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. Where our interests are overridden by a negative impact on your rights, we will not process your personal data.
How do we use your personal data?
We may process your personal data for the following purposes, depending on how you interact with us.
1. To complete the delivery of our foreign exchange, bank and international payment services (“Services”)
Without your personal data, we would not be able to open your moneycorp account, facilitate your foreign exchange transactions and complete the delivery of our services.
As part of our online account opening process, we will send you a one-off follow up registration email should you not complete the second page of the online account registration page. We will do this on the basis of our legitimate interests.
2. To respond to your queries and complaints
Without your personal data, we would not be able to effectively respond and handle queries or complaints. We may keep a record of our correspondence to demonstrate how we communicated with you throughout. We will do this on the basis of our legitimate interests and our legal obligations.
3. To comply with our legal and regulatory obligations
In order to meet our legal and regulatory requirements, we are required to carry out regulatory checks in order to prevent and detect fraud, money laundering, identity theft and other crimes. We are also required to send you communications known as ‘service messages’ in order to inform you about changes to the services we provide you. For example, changes to our terms and conditions and privacy policy, reserve and collect order confirmations and proof of payment confirmations . These service messages will not include any promotional content and cannot be unsubscribed from.
4. To analyse, test and improve our systems and databases
We may use your personal data to ensure that our systems are tested thoroughly. This ensures that the system can cope with comparable volumes of information, that a wide range of realistic scenarios are covered, and that the test will reflect all the possible combinations that occur in the real environment. Test systems are isolated from external networks to ensure that live systems are not compromised. In addition, to ensure data is not compromised, we carry out various risk assessments, and have implemented safeguards to ensure data security. We will do this on the basis of our legitimate interests.
5. To develop new and improved products and services, including conducting market research and product analysis
For this purpose, we will use cookies to personalise your next visits to our websites and to measure volumes and patterns of website usage. Full information can be found in our Cookie Policy here.

7. To keep you informed about relevant products, special offers and market news
For existing customers who currently agree to receive marketing, we will continue to send you relevant products, special offers and market news unless you tell us otherwise. We will rely on our legitimate interests and the soft opt-in exception made available by the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 to do this.
For new customers, we will only keep you informed about relevant products, special offers and market news where you have explicitly consented
You are free to opt out of receiving marketing communications from us at any time by one of the options set out in the “Managing your marketing preferences” section of this Statement.
