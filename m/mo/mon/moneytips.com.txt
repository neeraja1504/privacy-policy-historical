2. Personal Information
We may collect personally identifiable information from Users in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, when Users visit our site and in connection with other activities, services, features or resources we make available via our Services. We may require Users who use the Services to give us contact information, which may include but is not limited to the User's name, residential, business and/or mailing address, phone numbers, email address, and payment account information (collectively "Personal Information").

You can opt out of providing this additional information by not entering it or not using the Services, although not providing it may hinder your ability to use the Services or certain features and tools of the Services. The following are examples of situations where we collect Personal Information from Users:
Survey Information. Survey information is your voluntary submission of data to us to represent which will assist us in improving the experience for users of the Services.
Quote Information. Quote information is for the purposes of providing consumers with quotes for services from service providers including but not limited to various mortgage loans, insurance products, credit card offers and other service offerings.

Requests for Assistance or Service. When an individual requests assistance through MoneyTips' customer service department, and when an individual voluntarily subscribes to the Services or MoneyTips (or its affiliates') newsletters and publications.
3. Non-personally Identifiable Information
We may collect non-personally identifiable information ("Non-Personal Information") about Users whenever they interact with our websites, web pages, applications or platforms. Non-Personal Information may include the browser name, the type of computer and technical information about Users means of connection to the Services, such as the operating system and the Internet service providers utilized and other similar information. We may collect and share non-personal identification information to generate anonymized data and statistics about the behavior of Users of our websites, web pages, applications or platforms to analyze the usage of those websites, web pages, applications or platforms. We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Services. These tools collect information sent by your browser or mobile device as part of a web page/mobile application request, including the web pages you visit, your browser/device features, and other information that assists us in improving the Services. We collect and use this analytics information in aggregate form such that it cannot reasonably be manipulated to identify any particular User.
4. Automated Collection of Information
MoneyTips may use "cookies" to enhance User experience. User's web browser places cookies on their hard drive for record-keeping purposes and sometimes to track information about them. User may choose to set their web browser to refuse cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. If you choose not to accept cookies, please note that some parts and tools of the Services may not function properly.
MoneyTips may use web beacons via the Services. A web beacon is programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page (by using a programming function), but can also be used to transfer an individual's unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows MoneyTips to track certain websites an individual visits online. Web beacons are used to determine products or services an individual may be interested in, and to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes. MoneyTips also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in our database.
MoneyTips uses a common technology known as a "Clear GIF" or "1-by-1 Pixel" on our websites and in e-mail communications with users. A Clear GIF or "graphic interface format" is a small graphic (in fact, truly a 1x1 pixel) that we (or our partners) place on a page of our websites. We may also occasionally place GIFs in e-mail messages that we send to users. GIFs, which do not contain any Personal Information of users, provide us with important information about how users use the Services and respond to e-mail messages. With this information, we are better able to track the performance of certain promotions and understand the effectiveness of particular creative Email presentations. We may also allow our advertisers and promotional partners the ability to use GIFs on our websites solely to track users who link from their respective websites to our websites, but this ability to track such activity does not allow these entities access to user's Personal Information.
MoneyTips tracks information related to the electronic mailings and web pages viewed by users and subscribers, as well as the hyperlinks clicked by subscribers, while viewing our emails or visiting our websites. Log files are used to track and monitor subscriber usage. We collect your IP (Internet Protocol) address to help diagnose problems with our server, to gather information on your proximity to improve your experience using the Services and to administer the Services. An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. Your IP address is also used to help identify you during a particular session and to gather broad demographic data. MoneyTips may receive information about individuals from Third Parties or from other sources of information outside of our websites including information located in public databases. The use of technology on the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly evolving, as is MoneyTips' use of new and evolving technology. As a result, MoneyTips strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use of technology.
California Disclosure re: Do Not Track Signals from Web Browsers and Mobile Devices: Our websites are not presently configured to support Do Not Track ("DNT") signals from web browsers or mobile devices.
5. How We Use Collected Information

To personalize User experience. We may use information in the aggregate to understand how our Users as a group use the services and resources provided via the Services.
To improve our Services. We may use feedback you provide to provide, maintain, and improve our services as we deem appropriate in our sole discretion and to provide the Service, and to provide any other services that you and MoneyTips agree to.
To run a promotion, contest, survey or other features of the Services. To send Users information they agreed to receive about topics we think will be of interest to them.
We may also use the information to contact you to further discuss interest in us, the goods and services that we provide or promote, and to send information regarding our company or partners, such as promotions and events. You may be invited to receive an email newsletter or other correspondence by providing an email address. Your email address and any Personal Information will not be distributed or shared with third parties unless it is to transact such business as you have contracted us to do, to comply with any legal processes and/or law enforcement requests, or in order to conduct any business as we, in our sole subjective discretion, deem reasonable. We may also email (or send via other methods) information regarding updates to the Services or MoneyTips, and may send a newsletter, or other correspondence.
We may use the email address to respond to User inquiries, questions, and/or other requests. If User decides to opt-in to our mailing list, they will receive emails that may include company news, updates, related service information, etc. If at any time the User would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, we include detailed unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email. Even if you are removed from any such list, if you use the Service, you will continue to receive email correspondence from MoneyTips related to the Service. Any opt-out by you is not deemed valid until processed by MoneyTips. It is your obligation to verify that you have been opted-out.

For personal data that is subject to General Data Protective Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”), we rely on several legal bases to use and process your personal data, which include (i) when you have given consent, which you may withdraw at any time by accessing your Account settings; (ii) when data processing is necessary to perform a contract with you, such as the Terms and Conditions , and (iii) our legitimate business interests, such as improving and personalizing the Services, marketing new features or products that may be ofinterest to you, and promoting safety and security of the Service and our Customers.
6. How We Protect Your Information
We adopt appropriate data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction of your personal information, username, password, transaction information and data stored on our websites.
Sensitive and private data exchange between our websites and Users happens over a SSL secured communication channel and is encrypted and protected with digital signatures.
However, please note that data that is transported over an open network, such as the Internet or e-mail, may be accessible to anybody. We cannot guarantee the confidentiality of any communication or material transmitted via such open networks. When disclosing any personal information via an open network, you should remain mindful of the fact that it is potentially accessible to others, and consequently, can be collected and used by others without your consent. In particular, while individual data packets are often encrypted, the names of the sender and recipient are not. A third party may therefore be able to trace an existing bank account or relationship or one that is subsequently created. Even if both the sender and recipient are located in the same country, data may also be transmitted via such networks to other countries regularly and without controls, including to countries that do not afford the same level of data protection as your country of domicile.
Your data may be lost during transmission or may be accessed by unauthorized parties. We do not accept any liability for direct or indirect losses as regards the security of your Personal Information or data during its transfer via Internet. Please use other means of communication if you think this is necessary or prudent for security reasons.
7. Sharing Your Personal Information
We may share generic aggregated demographic information not linked to any personal identification information regarding visitors and users with our business partners, trusted affiliates and advertisers for the purposes outlined above. In addition to the use of information described above, MoneyTips reserves the right to disclose information provided by Users (including Personal Information) as follows:
Marketing and Order Fulfillment. MoneyTips will transfer user information (including Personal Information) to Third Parties when necessary to provide a product or service that the User orders or requests from such Third Party while using the Services or Third-Party sites, (including, for example, when completing a Quote Information request or when responding to offers provided by the Services). MoneyTips may also use a Third Party to provide you with information regarding the Services or to provide you with Third-party services and information which you have requested. All Third Parties associated with MoneyTips have entered into an agreement with us and are required to comply with all state and federal privacy regulations. By submitting a Quote Information request or responding to offers provided by the Services, you understand that Third Parties may contact you by telephone (on a recorded line), automated calling, mobile phone, SMS, email, or home mail delivery based on the information you provided to the site in order to process and fulfill your request, even if you have opted into the National Do Not Call List administered by the Federal Trade Commission, any state equivalent Do Not Call list or the Do Not Call List of any internal company. If one of MoneyTips' Third Party partners contacts you and you do not wish to be contacted again by that Third Party with respect to your inquiry, then you should specifically make a request to that Third Party not to contact you again. Please note that the Third Parties may maintain the information you provided whether you elect to use their services.
Disclosure By Law. You acknowledge and agree that we may disclose information you provide if required to do so by law, at the request of a third party, or if we, in our sole discretion, believe that disclosure is reasonable to (1) comply with the law, requests or orders from law enforcement, or any legal process (whether or not such disclosure is required by applicable law); or (2) protect or defend MoneyTips', or a third party's, rights or property.
Disclosure to Third Party Service Providers. We may share your information with third-party service providers to perform functions on our behalf. For example, outsourced customer care agents or technology assistants may need access to your information to perform services for you.
