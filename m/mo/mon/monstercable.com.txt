Monster, Inc. and its corporate affiliates ("Monster" or "we") provide this Website Privacy Statement in order to demonstrate our commitment to respect your privacy. This Website Privacy Statement explains how we collect certain personal information at our website at www.monsterproducts.com and any permutations thereof that directly link to this Website Privacy Statement.

Generally, you can visit Monster on the Web without telling us who you are or revealing any personally identifiable information about yourself.
