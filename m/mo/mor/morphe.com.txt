Unless you have agreed otherwise, these parties are not allowed to use your personal information for any other purpose except to assist in conducting our business. We take reasonable steps to ensure that such third parties are subject to confidentiality requirements and to obligations to process personal information in compliance with the same safeguards that we deploy. In particular, we may disclose your personal information:

5.2 From time to time, we may transfer your personal information to overseas recipients (including our related companies and any relevant third parties) if it is necessary to conduct our business.  We currently have operations in the United States, Canada, Australia and in  Europe and personal information is disclosed to recipients in those jurisdictions.

We may from time to time expand our operations and/or change the cloud-based or other solutions used to store personal information.
5.3 We take reasonable steps to ensure that the receiving party provides commitments relating to privacy and confidentiality which require the receiving party to limit its use of your personal information and to protect your personal information against misuse, loss and unauthorized access.  Where you are based in the UK or elsewhere in the European Economic Area (EEA), and we transfer your personal information outside of the EEA, we will impose the same data protection safeguards that we deploy inside the EEA.

All hardcopies of personal information are stored in secure areas.  Please notify us immediately if you believe there has been any unauthorized access to your information.
6.2 Although we take reasonable steps, we do not control how a third-party partner may use your data. Please note that third party recipients of personal information may have their own privacy policies and we are not responsible for their actions, including their handling of personal information.
6.3 We keep personal information as long as it is reasonably necessary for the purposes described in this Policy or otherwise in compliance with our or our service providers’ data retention policies.  Certain information may be retained until the time limit for any legal challenges has expired or in order to comply with regulatory requirements regarding the retention of such personal information.  If you have provided us with personal information in the course of applying for employment with us, and your application has not been successful, we may keep your personal information in case a suitable role becomes available.  Where applicable, if any personal information that we hold is no longer required for the purpose for which it was collected and no applicable law requires us to retain that information, we will take reasonable steps to de-identify or destroy the information.
