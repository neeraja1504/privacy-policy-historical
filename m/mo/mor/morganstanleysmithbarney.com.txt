MORGAN STANLEY SMITH BARNEY, LLC ONLINE PRIVACY POLICY
MORGAN STANLEY SMITH BARNEY, LLC
ONLINE PRIVACY POLICY
Effective Date January 10, 2014
Overview
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC (“MSSB”, “us”, “our” or “we”) appreciates that you have
provided us with your personal information and protecting that information is an important part
of how we conduct our business. We believe it is important for you to know how we treat
information about you that we may receive from this site (“Site”) or through a software
application on a mobile device that was created by Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC (an
“App”). Please read this Privacy Policy carefully before using this Site or an App (collectively,
our “online services”). This Privacy Policy currently is applicable only to United States
consumers and only when they access and use this Site or an App, and may not be applicable to
transactions performed and information collected in other channels. Our online services are not
directed to or intended for individuals under 18 years of age.
This Online Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, share and protect information when
you access or use our online services and how you can update and control the use of information
provided through our online services. This Online Privacy Policy does not apply to other
information we collect, including information collected on other sites, such as separate sites
operated by our affiliates or business partners or other information you may provide to us
through other means.
If you have a financial product or service with us, we will use and share any information that we
collect from or about you in accordance with our U.S. Customer Privacy Notice, which offers
you certain choices with respect to the use and sharing of your personal information.
Information Collected
Personal information means personally identifiable information such as information you provide
via forms, applications or other online fields including name, postal or email addresses,
telephone, fax or mobile numbers, account numbers, user name and password. There are
portions of our online services where we may collect personal information about you for
identification purposes or to fulfill your online requests. We may obtain information about you
directly from you, through your use of our products and services and from third parties (such as
credit bureaus and demographic firms).
In addition, when you visit our Site, our web servers collect the IP address of the device you used
to access the Internet, which pages on our Site you visited and when they were visited, your
Internet browser type and platform, the link that brought you to our Site and any links clicked

within our Site. This information may be used by us, our service providers, affiliates and
business partners to measure the number of visits, average time spent, page views and other
statistics about visitors to our Site. We also use this data to monitor Site performance and make
the Site easier and more convenient to use.
Our web servers also seek (as many websites do) to place a “cookie” (a small data file) on your
computer’s hard drive which allows the server to determine the computer when it visits again in
order to track statistical information about navigation to and throughout certain areas of our Site.
This cookie is not used to obtain your name or any personal information, and the information
that is tracked is used only for internal purposes, such as to improve site navigation and to
measure the effectiveness of our Site, and is not shared with anyone other than MSSB affiliates
and contractors who assist MSSB in these efforts and who are bound to confidentiality. Many
web browsers allow you to control the use of most cookies through their browser settings. To
learn more about cookies, including information on what cookies have been set on your
computer and how cookies can be managed and deleted, visit www.allaboutcookies.org. Unless
you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will reject cookies, our system will issue
cookies when you access or use our Site. In the event you refuse to accept cookies by adjusting
your browser setting, some or all areas of our Site may not function properly or may not be
accessible. To view our and our affiliates’ full Global Cookies Policy, click here.
When you download and use our Apps, we and companies we work with may track and collect
application usage data, such as the date and time the App on your device accesses our servers
and what information and files have been downloaded to the App based on your unique device
identifier, and may also collect the IP address of the device on which you use the App. In
addition, we may gather information such as which version of the application you are using, your
screen resolution, the type of operating system you have and your device model and
manufacturer. This information helps us provide a mobile experience that matches your device
and also helps us calculate usage levels of the App, diagnose problems, ensure that the App
functions properly and otherwise administer the App.
When you connect to us using a mobile application if you use any location-enabled products, you
may be sending us location information. MSSB does not store or use this information other than
to provide the service you requested. For example, a mobile product may use specific GPS data
to help you find a nearby retail branch, ATM or financial advisor. Location-enabled features are
opt-in and you have control over your participation and can turn these services off at any time.
Some mobile applications will utilize analytic tools to help us better serve our customers through
improved products, services, and revisions to the mobile applications. This collected information
does not identify you to MSSB. It may, however let us know anonymously, which services and
features you are using the most within the application, as well as device type and hardware
features, country and language of download.
