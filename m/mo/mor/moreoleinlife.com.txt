Consent to This Privacy Policy
By visiting our website, you signify your acceptance to the terms of this Privacy Policy with respect to information other than Personal Information.
By providing Windsor Foods with Personal Information, you signify that you agree with the terms of our current Privacy Policy with respect to your Personal Information.
If you do not agree with any terms in this Policy, please do not visit this website and/or provide any Personal Information.
If you choose not to provide Personal Information, you may not be able to do certain things, like access particular areas of our website, enter sweepstakes or contests, or send us e-mail.
Collection of Personal Information
As used in this Privacy Policy, “Personal Information” means personally identifiable information about you that identifies you as an individual, such as your name, street address, telephone number, credit card information, screen name and e-mail address.
When you provide us with Personal Information, you are authorizing us to use that information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy, which includes your right to limit our use of your Personal Information (see Who to Contact).
We may also collect Personal Information from you about a third party — for instance, you may ask us to forward information from our site to a friend or associate of yours, in which case we will need that person's name and e-mail address. Please note that we use such information only for the specified purpose (e.g., to mail the information) and we will not contact the third party again, unless and until the third party contacts us.
How We Use Your Information
When you supply us with Personal Information, we will use it for the express purpose for which it was collected (e.g., to enter you in a sweepstakes). It may also be used to contact you regarding other products and services that may be of interest to you, including those that we may offer jointly with other companies. At any time, however, you may choose to opt out of such contact (see Who to Contact).
We sometimes may retain third parties to analyze data that we collect, including Personal Information, to help us improve our products and our website. In addition, if you order a product or a service from us, we may provide Personal Information to suppliers and other third parties to enable delivery of such product or service. These third parties, including suppliers, are not authorized by us to use your Personal Information in any way other than that specified. Windsor Foods does not sell Personal Information.
We may supplement the information that you provide to us with other information that we receive from third parties. We do this for marketing purposes, in order to provide the most appropriate products and services to meet your needs.
We may also transfer, sell or assign your Personal Information to any entity to which we divest all or a portion of our business (for example, in connection with our sale of a brand), to the extent that you provided such information to the specific portion of our business (or brand) that is being divested, or otherwise in connection with a merger, consolidation, change in control, reorganization or liquidation of all or a portion of our business.
Finally, please note that we will release your Personal Information if required to do so by law, or by search warrant, subpoena or court order.
