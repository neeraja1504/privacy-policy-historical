About e-Newsletters and e-Vouchers
We do not spam. Periodically, we may send you information via email about new product releases or online credits that you may redeem for purchases on our online shop - Aevoe Universe. By periodically we mean fewer than once a month. Only Aevoe/Moshi will send you these direct mailings. If you do not want to be included on our mailing list, simply tell us when you sign up for your account. Or, at any time you wish to be removed from the mailing list, simply write to our customer representative at customer.service@moshicorp.com.
