Our Company shall provide the individual with the choice and means for limiting the use and disclosure of their Personal Data. Notice will be provided in clear and conspicuous language when individuals are first asked to provide Personal Data to our Company, or as soon as practicable thereafter, and in any event before our Company uses or discloses the Personal Data for a purpose other than for which it was originally collected. Mosaics Lab may be required to disclose Personal Data in response to lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

Agents, technology vendors and/or contractors of Mosaics Lab or its affiliates may have access to an individual’s Personal Data on a need to know basis for the purpose of performing services on behalf of Mosaics Lab or providing or enabling elements of the services. All such agents, technology vendors and contractors who have access to such information are contractually required to keep the information confidential and not use it for any other purpose than to carry out the services they are performing or as otherwise required by law.
3. Accountability for Onward Transfer. Prior to disclosing Personal Data to a third party, we shall notify the individual of such disclosure and allow the individual the choice (opt out) of such disclosure. We will:
● Limit the data we share with our partners and vendors to only that data we have permission to share.
● Proactively confirm that our partners and vendors understand purpose limitations.
● Ensure partners and vendors will make at least the same level of privacy protection as required by the Privacy Shield principles to comply with the purpose limitation and appropriate protection of that data.
● Transfer such data only for limited and specified purposes as detailed in the privacy policy.
● Ascertain that the agent is obligated to provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the Principles.

● Mosaics Lab requires any third party agent to notify us in the event that it makes a determination that it can not longer meet its obligation to provide the same level of protection as is required by the Privacy Shield principals.
● Provide a summary or representative copy, of the relevant privacy policy provision of its contract with that agent, to the department upon request.
● Unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. Mosaics Lab recognizes its responsibility and potential liability for onward transfers.

6. Access and Recourse. We acknowledge the individual’s right to access their Personal Data. We shall allow an individual access to their Personal Data and allow the individual the opportunity to correct, amend or delete inaccurate information, except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the privacy of the individual in the case in question or where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated. Individuals may contact our Privacy Officer via email to request access.
