Privacy Policy
Mountain Xpress has developed this privacy policy as part of its commitment to protecting individuals’ privacy.
When you visit our Web pages, we automatically log your Internet domain or address (IP address), geographic location and the Web location you clicked from, so we can tell how many people visit each page and how they find us. If you click on an ad, this is recorded so we can inform advertisers how many people respond to their ads. Some of our pages may place a small text file (a "cookie") on your computer so we can identify it when you visit. Most Web browsers are set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse cookies or to alert you when a cookie is being sent. However, some Web features and services may not function properly with cookies disabled.
We use Google Analytics to monitor and analyze traffic on our site. Most of our pages contain a code that causes Google to place a cookie on your computer to enable this monitoring. For information on how Google uses its cookies, consult the Google privacy policy.
We or our advertisers may use a third-party advertising company to serve some of the ads you see on our site. This company may use information about your visits to our and other Web sites in order to provide ads that may be of interest to you.
