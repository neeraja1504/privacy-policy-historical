C. Information Collected by Third Parties
Third parties may also collect information about you on our Sites through the use of technology. For example, third party analytics services may use cookies and web beacons to help us compile statistics about our Sites and visitors to our Sites. We receive assurances from those third party analytics services that they will not collect or access any information that directly identifies you on our Sites. Other third parties may also collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites when you visit our Site, for example, to display Mountain Hardwear ads to you on third party websites and to deliver third party ads to our Sites and others as described below. We also may use third party service providers to support our Sites.
This Policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, cookies or clear gifs in third party ads, and we encourage you to check the privacy policies of advertisers and/or ad services to learn about their use of cookies and other technology.
D. Information Collected From Other Sources
We may obtain information from other sources as follows:
From other trusted third-party sources to update or supplement the information that you provide or that we collect automatically. This includes, for example, information from public databases or data aggregators (which may include your demographic information, previous purchases, shopping habits, lifestyle preferences, or other information to validate or supplement the information we collect from or about you).
From our partners and service providers (including, for example, business partners, analytics vendors, advertising networks and search information providers).
We may use this information to help us maintain the accuracy of the information we collect, personalize your experience on the Sites, target our communications so that we can inform you of products, services or other offers that may be of interest to you, to measure ad quality and responses, and for internal business analysis or other business purposes.
E. Combination of Information
We may combine the information we collect from and about you, including information you provide to us and information we automatically collect through our Sites, as well as information collected offline, across other computers or devices that you may use, and from third party sources.
2. INFORMATION USE
A. Use of Information by Mountain Hardwear
We use information we collect for purposes described in this Policy or as disclosed to you in other ways including on our Sites, in our stores, or in connection with our services. For example, we may use your information to:
provide and deliver products and services;
send you information related to products and services, including confirmations, invoices, technical notices, updates, security alerts, and support and administrative messages;
communicate with you about new contests, promotions and rewards, upcoming events, and other news about products and services offered by Mountain Hardwear and our selected partners;
operate and improve our Sites, services and products;
process and deliver contest entries and rewards;
manage and administer our community features and member programs and services;
respond to your comments and questions and provide customer service;
provide you with customized content, targeted offers, and advertising on the Site, via email, direct mail or across other websites, mobile applications, social media or online services you may use;
link or combine with other personal information we get from third parties, to help understand your needs and provide you with better service;
use your data in an anonymous, aggregated, or de-identified format for analytical, marketing, and demographic purposes; and
provide you with other services or for other purposes as disclosed at the time you provide your information or otherwise with your consent.
B. How We Use Your Information for Interest-Based Advertising
We and others may use information collected using third-party cookies, clear gifs, web beacons, or other technologies on our Sites and in our emails to deliver Mountain Hardwear-branded advertising displayed to you on the Sites, on other third-party websites, mobile apps, social media, or other online services and across the computers or devices you use. We and others also may use cookie information to know when you return to our website after visiting these third-party websites. We and others use this and other information about you to try to understand your interests and show you relevant advertising about products and services that may interest you.
We also may display interest-based ads through digital advertising partners, like Facebook, Google, or other social media platforms or websites. For example, we may use these digital advertising partners to personalize ads you see on other websites or apps based on your shopping experience with us. We do this only by sharing hashed information (which converts your email or phone number to a unique string of numbers and letters) that the social media platform then matches data against its own data for the limited purpose of serving advertisements (either directly to you or to other lookalike audiences). The matched and unmatched hashes are then deleted, and are not used for any other purpose.
We also may use information we collect to deliver advertising that is targeted to individuals with similar interests. These tools allow us to create groups based on actual or assumed shared interests and/or factual characteristics based on anonymous and/or de-identified information to help us figure out what advertising may be most relevant. We also do this without having to share personal information with these third-party partners.
For more information about this practice and your choices with respect to interest-based ads, see the “Your Information Choices” section below.
3. SHARING OF INFORMATION
Certain sections of our Sites are designed as open and public community areas for connecting and sharing with other people. When you sign up for or participate in these areas you will be asked to provide certain information that may be displayed publicly along with photos, stories, posts, product reviews and other information you choose to provide. We may also post or publish your information when you submit comments, stories, photos, and videos in connection with surveys, contests, sweepstakes, or promotions offered on the Sites.
We share your personal information with third parties as follows:
with your consent, including if we notify you on the Sites that the information you provide will be shared in a particular manner and you provide such information or when you agree to our sharing of your information with other third parties for their own marketing purposes subject to their separate privacy policies;
with third party vendors, consultants and other service providers who are working on our behalf and need access to your information to carry out their work for us, including fulfilling orders or assisting us in advertising our products and services on third party websites;
if you choose to enter into one of our sweepstakes, contests, or other promotions (a “Promotion”) we may disclose your information to third parties or the public in connection with the administration of such Promotion, as required by law, as otherwise permitted by the Promotion’s official rules, or otherwise in accordance with the terms of this Policy;
to (a) comply with laws or respond to lawful requests and legal process, (b) to protect the rights and property of Mountain Hardwear, our agents, and others, including to enforce our agreements, policies and terms of use or (c) in the good faith belief that disclosure is needed to respond to an emergency or protect the personal safety of any person; and
in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.
4. SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
Mountain Hardwear takes reasonable measures to protect your personal information in an effort to prevent loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.
