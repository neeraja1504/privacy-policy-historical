personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us. Please read the following carefully to understand our
views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it.
This Policy applies to personal data collected in connection with products and services offered by or from other interactions with us where a

IP addresses
We may collect information about your computer, including where available your Internet protocol (IP) address, operating system and
browser type, for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. This is statistical data about our users’
browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual.
Use of cookies and web beacons
When you visit our site, information is placed on your computer to allow us to recognise your computer. This information is commonly in
the form of a text file known as a “cookie”. Cookies are small pieces of data stored on your computer’s hard drive, rather than on the website.
We use cookies:
 that are strictly necessary to enable you to move around our site or to provide certain basic features. We use cookies to enhance the
functionality of our site by storing your preferences, for example. We also use cookies to help us to improve the performance of
our site to provide you with a better user experience;
 for website traffic analysis and anonymous demographic profiling so that we may improve our services; and
 to enable us to identify your device, or you when you have logged into our site and to collect certain information about your
computer, including your IP address, your computer’s operating system, your browser type and the address of any referring
websites. Our use of cookies is intended to provide benefits to you, such as eliminating the need for you to enter your password
frequently during a session or the need to re-enter items you place in a shopping cart if you do not finish a transaction in a single
visit.
We may use so-called web beacons (or “pixel tags”) in connection with our site. However, we do not use them to identify individual users
personally. Web beacons are typically graphic images that are placed on a website and they are used to count visitors to a website and/or to
access certain cookies. This information is used to improve our services. Web beacons do not typically collect any other information than the
information your browser provides us with as a standard part of any Internet communication. If you turn off cookies, the web beacon will no
longer be able to track your specific activity. The web beacon may, however, continue to collect information of visits from your IP-address,
but such information will no longer be unique.
If you do not wish to receive cookies, or want to be notified before they are placed, you may set your web browser to do so, if your browser
so permits. Please understand that if cookies are turned off, you may not be able to view certain parts of this site that may enhance your visit.
Some of our business partners whose content is linked to or from this site may also use cookies or web beacons. However, we have no access
to or control over these cookies.
Storage of your personal data;
Data Quality
We take steps to keep the personal data we possess accurate and up-to-date and to delete out of date or otherwise incorrect or unnecessary
personal data.
As certain products and services may allow you to manage your profile, we encourage you to access your personal data from time to time to
ensure that it is correct and up-to-date. Please remember that it is your responsibility to provide us with correct details as well as to update
the personal data you have provided us with in case of any changes.
Security
While there are always risks associated with providing personal data, whether in person, by phone, via the internet or otherwise, and no
technology is completely safe or “tamper” or “hacker” proof, we take appropriate technical and organisational information security measures
to prevent and minimise such risks.
Such measures include, where appropriate, the use of firewalls, secure server facilities, encryption, implementing proper access rights
management systems and processes, careful selection of processors and other technically and commercially reasonable measures to provide
appropriate protection for your personal data against unauthorised use or disclosure.
Where appropriate, we may also take back-up copies and use other such means to prevent accidental damage or destruction to your personal
data.
If a particular part of our site supports online transactions, all information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Any payment
transactions will be encrypted using an industry standard security measure, such as the one available through “Secure Sockets Layer”
(“SSL”), to protect the confidentiality and security of online transactions. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password
which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a
password with anyone.
The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). It may
also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff maybe engaged in, among other
things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your
personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated
securely and in accordance with this Policy.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your
personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have
received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.
Uses made of the information
We use information held about you in the following ways (Please note that one or more purposes may apply simultaneously):
 to ensure that content from our site is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your computer:
 to fulfil your requests, process your order, for credit status approval and/or to verify your personal data in order to supply network
airtime or services, or as may otherwise be necessary to perform or enforce the contract between you and us, to ensure the
functionality and security of our products and services, to identify you and to prevent and investigate fraud and other misuses:
 to personalise our offering and to provide you with information, products or services that we feel may interest you, where you
have consented to be contacted for such purposes and to display customised content and advertising in our site.
 for marketing or research purposes, for example, to conduct market research and we may, in accordance with applicable law,
contact you to inform you of new products, services or promotions we may offer.
 to develop our products and/or services. However, for the most part we only use aggregate and statistical information in the
development of our products and services.
 To allow you to participate in interactive features of our service, when you choose to do so.
We may share your personal data if we have your consent to do so.
We may also use your data, or permit selected third parties to use your data, to provide you with information about goods and services which
may be of interest to you and we or they may contact you about these by email, telephone or post.
If you are an existing customer, we will only contact you by electronic means (e-mail or SMS) with information about goods and services
similar to those which were the subject of a previous sale to you.
If you are a new customer, and where we permit selected third parties to use your data, we (or they) will contact you by electronic means
only if you have consented to this.
By agreeing to our terms and conditions at the point of sale you are giving consent for Mobile Phones Direct to use your details for the
marketing and research purposes listed above.
If you do not want us to use your data in this way, or to pass your details on to third parties for marketing purposes, you will be given the
opportunity to unsubscribe from our marketing list when we contact you for the first time. If you wish to be removed from our mailing list
beforehand however, please contact us via webshop@mobilephonesdirect.co.uk and you will receive confirmation on the removal of your
data from all marketing purposes.
Some of our products and services may be used to promote products and services of other companies. We do not disclose information about
identifiable individuals to our advertisers or any other company, except to a member of our group (as indicated in the section on sharing your
personal data below), for marketing purposes without your prior consent. We may however provide aggregate information about our users
(for example, we may inform them that 500 men aged under 30 have clicked on their advertisement on any given day). We may also use such
aggregate information to help advertisers reach the kind of audience they want to target (for example, women in SW1). We may make use of
the personal data we have collected from you to enable us to comply with our advertisers’ wishes by displaying their advertisement to that
target audience.
Disclosure of your information
We may disclose your personal information to any member of our group, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its
subsidiaries, as defined in section 1159 of the UK Companies Act 2006.
We may disclose your personal information to third parties:
      such as mobile networks or insurance companies who process personal data for us for the purposes described in this Policy. Such parties are not
permitted to use your personal data for other purposes unless you agree for them to do so within their separate terms and conditions, and we
require them to act consistently with this Policy and to use appropriate security measures to protect your personal data;
      in relation to those of our products and services which are provided using resources and servers located in various countries around the world.
Therefore your personal data may be transferred across international borders outside the country where you use our services, including to
countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA) that do not have laws providing specific protection for personal data or that have different
legal rules on data protection, for example, the United States of America. In such cases we take steps to ensure that there is a legal basis for such
a transfer and that adequate protection for your personal data is provided as required by applicable law, for example, by using standard
agreements approved by relevant authorities (where necessary) and by requiring the use of other appropriate technical and organisational
information security measures;
      if we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or
assets;
      if we or substantially all of our assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by it about its customers will be one of the
transferred assets; and
 if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our
terms of use or terms and conditions of supply and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Mobile Phones Direct
(Online) Ltd, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud
protection and credit risk reduction.
Your rights
You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes. We will usually inform you (before collecting your data) if we
intend to use your data for such purposes or if we intend to disclose your information to any third party for such purposes. You can exercise your right
to prevent such processing by checking certain boxes on the forms we use to collect your data. You can also exercise the right at any time by
contacting us through the contact points referred to below.
In some cases, especially if you wish us to cease the processing of your personal data, this may also mean that we may not be able to continue to
provide the services to you. We encourage you to use available profile management tools for the above purposes as such tools often provide you with
direct access to your personal data and allow you to effectively manage it.

Please note that we may need to identify you and to ask for additional information in order to be able to fulfil your above request. Please also note that
applicable law may contain restrictions and other provisions that relate to your above rights.
