If you are eligible for a survey opportunity, the third party market research company will provide an identification number and a survey link to us and we will invite you to participate in the survey. If you have any questions about this data sharing please contact our support using our contact form.
We may host information request forms on behalf of our clients. These forms will clearly identify the identity and contact details of the organization collecting the information, and the information you provide will be managed according to the privacy policy of that third party. In the event that you complete a web form hosted by us, we will only disclose the specific information provided by you to that specific third party.
With the exceptions listed above, we WILL NOT disclose your information to any third party without your permission unless such action is necessary to:

We will not share your name, email address, or phone number with the Third Party MR Companies. In connection with the sharing of your information with a Third Party MR Company, your information may be transferred and stored outside of your country of residence, including, without limitation, in the United States.

If you participate, you may be re-contacted about the online ad or promotion and the market research firm will use the third party technology to determine whether you have seen, clicked on, or otherwise interacted with the online ad or promotion.

3. Data Security
Information collected by MOBROG is stored in accordance with our site security policy and we take reasonable steps to ensure that Member information is secure from unauthorized access, interference and loss, modification or disclosure. If MOBROG no longer requires a specific information, we will take reasonable steps to destroy such information.
4. Access & Correction
Information collected by MOBROG can be accessed and updated by the Member by using the facility provided on the Site (you will be required to log in first). Furthermore you can contact MOBROG Support anytime and ask for any stored information concerning you. You can easily request deletion of your information by opting-out as described below.
5. Linked Sites
The MOBROG Site, the survey invitations we send you, and if applicable, the email promotions we send you may provide links to our partner and advertiser web sites. If you link to any of these Third Party sites this policy will not apply to your use of those sites.
6. Frequency of email communications
All email communications that result from your MOBROG membership will be sent directly from us and will prominently feature the MOBROG logo and our contact details. Except PayPal, none of our partner companies will contact you. After completing a given survey, you may experience a gap of some number of days before another survey invitation is offered. While every attempt is made to send each Member survey invitations frequently, due to various factors, a given Member may not receive as many invitations to participate in surveys as they would like. Note that MOBROG is under no obligation to offer any specific or minimum number of survey invitations whatsoever.
7. Opting out
As a condition of membership, you must provide a valid email address and agree to accept survey invitations from us.
If you do not wish to receive survey invitations from us, you must terminate your membership using the facility provided in the profile. A link to an opt-out facility is also provided at the bottom of every survey invitation we send you (you will be required to log in first). By following this link you may terminate your membership.
In the event that you opt-out it may take up to 72 hours for your opt-out request to take effect. You will not receive any further email promotions from us after that time.
Your account will become inactive for and permanently deleted after seven days except from such data that has to be archived for legal reasons. After that, all personally identifiable information will be destroyed. This also affects any outstanding or undelivered rewards due. If you want to reverse your membership termination within these seven days, please contact our support.
8. Changes to this policy
MOBROG reserves the right to update this policy from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. We will post any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of privacy policy changes).  If you do not agree with this privacy policy in completely or in part, or if you do not agree with changes made to this policy, you must not become a member or terminate your account.
