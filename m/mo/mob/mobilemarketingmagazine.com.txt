Our Website - Cookies
We use cookies on our website, which may collect personal data. We may publish a separate Cookie Policy on our website to provide more information about the cookies we use. You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access cookies. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of our website may become inaccessible or not function properly.
Our Website - Third-party links
Our website may include links to third-party websites, plug-ins and applications. Clicking on those links or enabling those connections may allow third parties to collect or share data about you. We do not control these third-party websites and are not responsible for their privacy statements. When you leave our website, we encourage you to read the privacy notice of every website you visit.
Suppliers
If you are a supplier to us, you will be asked to supply certain personal data to us and we will process that personal data for the purposes of the contract that you and we enter into for the supply of your products/services.
Who we share your personal information with
We will share the registration details that you provide to us either on registration for an event, upon downloading our research Whitepapers, or on participating in our webinars (“Your Details”) with the digital partners who are sponsoring the event you are attending, or the research partner of the Whitepaper you download, or the presenting partner of the webinar you participate in, as applicable.
Attendance at our events, downloading our Whitepapers and participating in our webinars is free of charge because the sponsors of the event, the research partner of the Whitepaper, or the presenting partners of the webinar (the “Digital Partners”) have funded the event/Whitepaper/webinar and made it possible. Details of the Digital Partners are shown on the relevant registration page on our website. In return, we will provide Your Details to our Digital Partners so they can send marketing communications to you. This may involve a transfer of your personal data outside the EU. Nevertheless, the Digital Partners will have to comply with applicable data protection legislation.
We require your express consent to this as a condition of registration, because our events, research papers and webinars would not be possible on a free-to-access basis without this requirement. We consider that the privacy impact upon you is minimal, and is off-set by the benefits of being able to attend/access our events, research papers and webinars free of charge.
If you do not consent to the passing of Your Details to our Digital Partners (by ticking the box on our website registration form), you will not be able to proceed to register for, or attend/access, our events, research papers and webinars.
We may also share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out in the table above.
• Service providers (acting as processors) who provide services to us, including for example IT service providers;
• Professional advisers (acting as processors or joint controllers) including bankers, lawyers, accountants and insurers who provide banking, consultancy, legal, insurance and accounting services.
• HM Revenue & Customs, regulators and other authorities (acting as processors or joint controllers) who may require reporting of processing activities in certain circumstances.
We may make your personal data available to our sister company, Masterclassing Inc, who are based in the USA. The USA does not have the same data protection laws as the United Kingdom and EEA. Any such transfer of your personal information will be subject to the European Commission approved standard data protection clauses as permitted under Article 46(2)(d) of the General Data Protection Regulation that are designed to help safeguard your privacy rights and give you remedies in the unlikely event of a misuse of your personal information.
We will not share your personal information with any other third party.
Whether information has to be provided by you, and if so why
The provision of name, company, job title, email address and telephone number is required from you to enable us to process your registration at one of our service offerings – events, whitepapers, awards, webinars. We will inform you at the point of collecting information from you, whether you are required to provide the information to us. If you do not provide the information we ask for, we may not be able to make our events, products or services available to you.
How long your personal information will be kept
We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
By law we have to keep basic information about our customers for seven years after they cease being customers, for tax purposes.We keep personal data relating to our suppliers for longer, as it is in both our interests and theirs that they remain on our system and potentially available for work from us.
