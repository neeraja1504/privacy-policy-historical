However, mobME does not disclose your personal data to such companies or any other company for marketing purposes without your prior consent.
Personalising our offering

Statistical purposes
We may also use your personal data for statistical purposes.
5. Collecting the data of children
Generally, mobME avoids collecting the personal data of children. However, our databases may nevertheless contain personal data of children due to the fact that it is not always possible to determine precisely the age of the user. Insofar as we ask you to provide your age, we block the service from any person who is under 13 years of age. From time to time, we will also make reasonable efforts to clear our databases of personal data relating to children.
mobME's policy is to request that minors (the age of minors is determined by local law where you reside) do not make purchases or engage in other legal acts on this site without the consent of a parent or legal guardian, unless otherwise permitted by applicable local law.
6. Ensuring data quality
We aim to keep the personal data accurate and up-to-date and to delete out of date or otherwise incorrect personal data.
Insofar as you provide us with your personal data directly, we would like to remind you that it is your responsibility to provide us with correct and relevant information. As certain mobME products and services may allow you to manage your profile, we also encourage you from time to time to access your details to ensure that your personal data is correct and up-to-date.
To the extent permitted by applicable legislation, we may use public sources in order to verify that personal data we possess is correct.
7. Regular disclosures and transfer of personal data
Generally, we do not sell, lease, rent or otherwise disclose your personal data to unauthorized third parties without your prior consent.
mobME Affiliates, processors and other involved parties
We may transfer and/or disclose your personal data between mobME Affiliates in connection with processing personal data for purpose(s) for which it was collected, being a purpose outlined in this Privacy Policy.
Generally, mobME may make use of third parties to process personal data on its behalf. Personal data may also be transferred to mobME's business partners to the extent necessary for the provision of our products and services, such parties being, for example, mobME's professional advisers and mobME's retailers selling or providing our products and services. In all cases where a third party is granted access to personal data in order to provide processing services or as is necessary to provide mobME's products and services, the third party is bound by contractual agreement to process your personal data consistently with this Privacy Policy and to use appropriate security measures to protect the confidentiality and integrity of your personal data.
In case a part of mobME's business is sold to a third party, the customer data registers relating to that business may be transferred to the entity that continues to operate the business.
Financial and other such institutions
In relation to products and services requiring financial payment, your personal data may be provided to financial institutions and other third parties involved in such monetary transactions and in securing mobME's financial interests related to that transaction.
Law enforcement and other governmental bodies
Certain law enforcement agencies and other governmental bodies may have a legal right to obtain personal data from mobME. In such a case, mobME transfers personal data to the extent required by law.
International transfers
mobME is a global organization having Affiliates, business processes, management structures, and technical systems that cross borders. This being the case, our products and/or services may be provided by using resources located in various countries around the world. Accordingly, your personal data may be transferred outside the country where you use the service or otherwise provide us with your personal data. That includes countries that do not have laws which provide specific protection for personal data where you may have fewer legal rights. However, mobME's privacy practices have been implemented so that all processing of your personal data is conducted in accordance with this Privacy Policy in every country where mobME does business.

We endeavour to take appropriate measures, such as the use of firewalls, secure server facilities, encryption, implementing of proper access rights management systems and processes, careful selection of processors and other technically and commercially reasonable measures to provide appropriate protection for your personal data against unauthorised use or disclosure. We also make appropriate back-up copies and use other such means to prevent the accidental damage or destruction to your personal data and to ensure that our services are functioning properly.
