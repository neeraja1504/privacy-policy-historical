Mobile88: Privacy Policy
We at Mobile88 take your privacy very seriously. We believe that electronic privacy is crucial for the ongoing success of the Internet.
We believe this information should only be used to help us provide you with better service. That's why we have put a policy in place to protect your personal information.
Summary of Our policy
In general, when you visit our websites and access information you remain anonymous. Before we ask you for information, we will explain how this information will be used. We will not provide any of your personal information to other companies or individuals without your permission.
Some of our sections require registration to access, although typically all that's requested is an e-mail address and some basic information about you.
There are occasions where we will ask for additional information. We do this to be able to better understand your needs, and provide you with services that we believe may be valuable to you. Some examples of information our websites collect are name, email, home page address, and personal info. We give you the opportunity to elect not to receive materials from us.
Protecting your privacy
We will take appropriate steps to protect your privacy. Whenever you provide sensitive information (for example, a credit card number to make a purchase), we will take reasonable steps to protect it, such as encrypting your card number. We will also take reasonable security measures to protect your personal information in storage. Credit card numbers are used only for payment processing and are not retained for marketing purposes.
We will not provide any of your personal information to other companies or individuals without your permission.
Our websites provide links to other web sites. Since we do not control those websites, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of these web sites.

Mobile88 may use an outside ad company to display ads on our site. Ads may contain cookies, and appear to be coming from the Website, but in reality they are coming from our partners who are serving ads on the Website. Certain websites may place a "cookie" on your machine in order to provide personalised services and/or maintain your identity across multiple pages within a single session.
