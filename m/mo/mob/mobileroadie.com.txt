If at any time you have questions about our practices or any of your rights described below, you may reach our dedicated team by contacting us at support@mobileroadie.com. This inbox is actively monitored and managed so that we can deliver an experience that you can confidently trust.
(A) Mobile Roadie Customers
What personal information do we collect?
If you are a Mobile Roadie Customer, when you register with us through the Site to create and manage Mobile Offerings, we will ask you for personally identifiable information, such as your full name, company name, email address, billing address, phone, payment information.
In addition, we may collect information related to interactions of End Users with your Mobile Offerings as described in part (B) below.
How we use your personal data?
We use such personally identifiable information (in some cases, in conjunction with your non-identifying information, such as your zip code) mainly to provide the Mobile Roadie services, register you as customer for mobile offering creation and management, complete your transactions, administer your inquiries, and contact Mobile Roadie Customers regarding account activities, new version and product offerings, or other communications relevant to the Mobile Roadie services.
We do not sell any personally identifiable information of Mobile Roadie Customers to any third parties. The instances where we may share such information with third parties are described in part (D) below.
How you can access, update or delete your data?
You may review and update the personally identifiable information in your registration profile by logging in and editing such information in your dashboard. If you decide to delete all of your personal information we may cancel your account. You can also send a request to support@mobileroadie.com to initiate the removal of your personal data. The request will be honored only to the extent it is no longer necessary for any Services purchased or required for our legitimate business purposes or legal or contractual record keeping requirements.
Also, you have the right to receive a copy of certain personal information we process about you. This comprises any personal information we process on the basis of your consent.

(B) End Users
What personal information do we collect?
Except in the case of Free Mobile Website Solutions (defined below), if you decide to download, access and/or use a Mobile Offering, we will be collecting and storing on behalf of the applicable Mobile Roadie Customer any personally identifiable information that you provide to such Mobile Roadie Customer. This information may include your full name, email address, postal code, birthday and gender. Some data is optional information that a Mobile Roadie Customer may choose to collect, which optional information and is not required to use the Mobile Offering. Other instances where the data you provide through use of a Mobile Offering is collected by Mobile Roadie on behalf of our Customers is where you choose to allow a Mobile Offering to collect your location data. In these instances such location data will be available to the applicable Mobile Roadie Customer.
In addition, if you have an account with Facebook, Twitter, or Foursquare or other similar websites (each a “Social Network”), your Social Network identity, including your public picture, may be associated with your location data. This means that the Mobile Roadie customer will be able to identify you personally and see specific locations that you have recently visited, including, potentially, your real time location, and may decide to contact you, for instance, by informing you about events or product offerings available in your area. You may at any time turn off this functionality by using the in-app privacy settings.

If you no longer wish to receive such information from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications. In the event that a Mobile Roadie Customer converts its Free Mobile Website Solution to one for which the customer must pay a fee to provide via our Service, the personally identifiable information and other information retained by Mobile Roadie prior to the date of conversion (“Specific Shared Data”), will be shared with the Mobile Roadie Customer for use by such customer to provide you with information and marketing materials about its own products and services. We only share Specific Shared Data with a Mobile Roadie Customer pursuant to an agreement under which such customer is obligated to maintain and use the Specific Shared Data it receives solely in compliance with the Mobile Roadie Privacy Policy. After conversion of the Free Mobile Website Solution to a paid Mobile Site, information collected from you via the website will be done so by Mobile Roadie on behalf of the Mobile Roadie Customer as described herein.
On behalf of Mobile Roadie Customers, we may also collect your IP addresses as well as non-identifying details such as the geographic location of the IP address you are using to access the Internet.
When you use a Mobile Offering , you may allow other End Users to send you personal messages, in which case we may send you alerts when you get a new message. You may at any time turn off this functionality by using the in-app privacy settings.
You may be asked by Mobile Roadie Customers to provide additional information to them, including your personally identifiable information, to be used and shared pursuant to their own privacy policies. We encourage you to read such privacy policies before providing any information to any Mobile Roadie Customers or other third parties.

How we secure, store and retain your data
Mobile Roadie is very concerned with safeguarding your information. We employ administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access. We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored “personal data” (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you via email or conspicuous posting on this Site in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.
We follow generally accepted standards to store and protect the personal data we collect, both during transmission and once received and stored, including utilization of encryption where appropriate.
We retain personal data only for as long as necessary to provide the Services you have requested and thereafter for a variety of legitimate legal or business purposes. These might include retention periods:
mandated by law, contract or similar obligations applicable to our business operations;
for preserving, resolving, defending or enforcing our legal/contractual rights;
needed to maintain adequate and accurate business and financial records.
If you have any questions about the security or retention of your personal data, you can contact us at support@mobileroadie.com.
International Transfer
Your information may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, Mobile Roadie transfers personally identifiable information to the United States and processes it there. Whether you are a Mobile Roadie Customer, an End-User or a Visitor, your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.
Links to Other Sites
Our Site contains links to other websites. If you choose to visit an advertiser by “clicking on” a banner ad or other type of advertisement, or click on another third party link, you will be directed to that third party's website. The fact that we link to a website or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.
Our Policy Toward Children
Neither this Site nor the Service is directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with personally identifiable information without their consent, he or she should contact us at support@mobileroadie.com. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personally identifiable information, we will delete such information from our files.
Beacon Partners
We share data we collect about you including unique identification numbers associated with mobile devices or through its API (including, for example, a Unique ID for Advertisers ("IDFA"), Unique ID for Vendors ("IDFV"), Google Ad ID, or Windows Advertising ID), mobile carrier, device type, model and manufacturer, mobile device operating system brand and model, and, depending on the user's mobile device settings and consent, the geographical location data, including GPS coordinates (e.g. latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding the location of the mobile device (“User Data”) with our third party partners, that enables us to use Bluetooth beacons to provide you with information or offers specific to your location and interests.
By using our Service and installing Apps containing our Signal360 integration, you give the App permission to access your device's microphone while our App is running (including while running in the background). The microphone is used as part of Signal360's PMT by detecting Beacons which emit a high frequency audio signal that cannot be heard by humans. All audio data received by the App is stored for a short time in the device's transient buffer memory which is constantly being deleted and overwritten with newer audio data. The length of the audio data stored in transient buffer memory at any given time before it is overwritten with newer audio data is up to one millisecond. None of the audio data received by the App is retained by or transmitted from your device to Signal360 servers, Beacons, or any other device. The App scans the audio data received by your device's microphone for the high frequency signal emitted by the Beacon and discards the audio data of all other frequencies. As described above, the non-discarded high frequency data is only stored in increments of up to one millisecond and is subsequently overwritten by new high frequency data in one millisecond increments. When the App detects a Beacon, it may match the signal with a set of marketing materials on your device. All marketing materials are pre-downloaded to the App as part of its regular update process. No marketing materials are sent to your device by the Beacons themselves. To put plainly: Our App does not at any time store more than up to one millisecond of your microphone's surrounding audio data; (ii) our Technology then filters and uses only the high frequency wavelengths (not audible to the human ear) of the audio data it stores for our Services; (iii) our App does not transmit any of the audio data it captures outside of your phone (neither to our servers or to any third party servers); and (iv) all audio data captured by our App is deleted and overwritten in up to one millisecond increments.
By accepting our terms of service, you consent to the collection, storage and processing the aforementioned data by our third party partners for the purposes of: (i) providing or improving their services; (ii) enabling third parties to assist us and the retailer and venues (in which the beacons are located) in better serving and understanding our users; and (iii) sharing your data with third parties so they can provide or enable the provision of content, offers or other marketing solutions that may be of interest to you. You also consent to having your data transferred to and processed in the United States or any other jurisdiction in which our third party partners or their parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, service providers or partners maintain facilities. If you do not consent to the collection and transfer of the aforementioned data through the identification of your mobile device, we recommend that you: (a) delete our app or adjust the in-app settings of the app; or (b) delete the applicable mobile advertiser ID by limiting ad tracking on the device. For iOS, navigate to your Settings > Select Privacy > Select Advertising > Enable the “Limit Ad Tracking” setting. For Android, open your Google Settings app > Ads > Enable “Opt out of interest-based advertising".
