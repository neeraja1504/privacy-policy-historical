Akmin Technologies Private Limited ("AKMIN") recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of all information provided by users and customers of our websites, apps and services. We created this policy with a fundamental respect for our user´s right to privacy and to guide our relationships with our users. This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for all products, apps and services owned by AKMIN. A current list of web sites can be found at http://www.akmin.com
There are many different ways you can use our services - to evaluate our service, to use our apps, to read content, to give feedback, to register for our service etc. When you share information with us like your email address, Unique Device identifiers etc, it helps us in the identification of a particular user, so that we can make those services even better - to show you more relevant content, to help the users receive more relevant information etc.
Information We Collect and How We Use
In this section of our privacy policy, we will describe the type of information we collect and how we use it to provide better services to our customers.
Device information
We collect device-specific information (such as your hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information including phone number). Akmin may associate your device identifiers or phone number with your Account for the apps or service that you have signed for with Akmin.
Registration
When evaluating some of our products online, users must first register. During registration, users are required to give their contact information (such as name, e-mail address, mailing address and phone number). We also may collect demographic information (such as job title and purchasing responsibilities, company information and professional certification). For internal purposes, we use this information to communicate with users and provide requested services, and, for our website visitors, to provide a more personalized experience on our sites. We use aggregate demographic information about our audience to improve our service, for marketing purposes and/or industry reporting purposes.
Communications with Us:
We have features where users can submit information to us (such as our feedback forms). Requests for service, support or information may be forwarded as needed to best respond to a specific request. We may retain e-mails and other information sent to us for our internal administrative purposes, and to help us to serve customers better.
Communications from Us: Service Updates, Special Offers
In order to best serve our customers, we may send updates that contain important information about our sites and services. For example, we send new members a welcoming message, and verify password and username for our password-protected sites. We may also communicate with a user to provide requested services and for account-related issues via e-mail, phone or regular mail.
Automatic Data Collection
Our web sites have features that automatically collect information from users, to deliver content specific to user´s interests and to honor their preferences. This information assists us in creating sites that will serve the needs of our users.
For our internal purposes, we gather date, time, browser type, navigation history and IP address of visitors to our site. This information does not contain anything that can identify users personally. We use this information for our internal security audit log, trend analysis and system administration, and to gather broad demographic information about our user base for aggregate use.
We may combine demographic information supplied by a subscriber at registration with site usage data to provide general profiles, in aggregate non-personally identifiable form, about our users and their preferences in the content of the site and advertising. We may share this composite information with our advertisers and business affiliates to help them better understand our services.
With whom your Information is Shared
We do not share personally identifiable information with other companies, apart from those acting as our agents in providing our product(s)/service(s), and which agree to use it only for that purpose and to keep the information secure and confidential. Also, our parent, subsidiary and affiliate companies, entities into which our company may be merged, or entities to which any of our assets, products, sites or operations may be transferred, will be able to use personal information. We will also disclose information we maintain when required to do so by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena or other legal obligation, in response to a law enforcement agency´s request, or in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property.
We may share aggregate information, which is not personally identifiable, with others. This information may include usage and demographic data, but it will not include personal information. When you contact Akmin, we keep a record of your communication to help solve any issues you might be facing. We may use your email address to inform you about our services, such as letting you know about upcoming changes or improvements.
Correction/Updating Personal Information
If a user´s personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code), or if a user no longer desires our product(s)/service(s), we provide a way to correct or update that user´s personal data. The user should contact Customer Support for the applicable Product, App or Service.
Security
We use reasonable precautions to protect our user´s personal information and to store it securely. Sensitive information that is transmitted online is encoded or encrypted and is transmitted to us securely. We encrypt some of our services using SSL. In addition, access to all of our user´s information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, a billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. We review our information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security measures, to guard against unauthorized access to systems. Finally, the servers on which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.
Links
Our web sites contain links to other sites. AKMIN is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each web site to which we may link that may collect personally identifiable information.
Notification and Changes
If we change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so our users are aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under which circumstances, if any, we disclose it. Users should check this policy frequently to keep abreast of any changes.
