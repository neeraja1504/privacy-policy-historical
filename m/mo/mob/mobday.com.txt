(!) Rather we collect data about your computer or device using a number of technologies, the explanation to which you will find below. The information we collect is pseudonymous, generalized, and is not considered to be personal information in the majority of jurisdictions. In some other jurisdictions in which we provide services to our clients, in certain contexts, such information, including Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and other pseudonymous information, like certain unique device identifiers that may identify a particular computer or mobile device (for instance, in European Union) such information is considered to be a personal information.
Please take notice, that we may work with third party data platforms or applications that may be directly integrated into our technology or used separately, supplementing our technology by us or our clients. It helps to deliver targeted advertisements using our advertising technology more efficiently or it allows our clients to use multiple interfaces and manage data more efficiently. Finally, our clients may use third-party data in combination with your user information to deliver targeted advertisement materials and/or inventory across multiple devices that may ultimately be processed by our technology without our knowledge thereof.

Information about your browser: including information about your browser type and language, and browser history.

How We Collect User Information.
We use cookies and other standard web technologies to collect information automatically from your device, including:
Cookies. The cookie technology is based on a small-size data files that usually include a unique identifier, placed on a visitor's device or computer. Cookies are usually stored at user's computer permanently or temporarily (persistent cookies). We use cookies on our clients' websites in order to operate our technology, collect user information, and statistically analyze advertisement preferences.
Tags and Pixels. Tags and Pixels are blocks of code that we and our clients may use to track your browsing on the Internet: from resources to any particular websites or applications to track your browsing behavior. Sometimes web beacons are used for this purposes. They are usually transparent or invisible graphic images, no larger than 1x1 pixel, they are placed on a page or otherwise, Internet resource or sent within an e-mail to monitor the behavior of the user visiting the resource or sending the e-mail. It is often used in combination with cookies. We create and use a unique synchronization system to check the quality of information that we have collected with information that our clients collected independently, and later help our clients or third parties that intend to provide you with targeted advertisements.
Mobile device identifiers. Mobile Device Identifiers or Mobile Device IDs are unique identifiers which can be used to identify a mobile device. We may use standard device identifiers, to track your use of mobile applications and to determine if a piece of advertisement inventory has been delivered to a specific user or retargeted, or to determine the frequency of certain inventory for a certain user. Ultimately, passing device's ID back to advertisers helps us and our clients to improve the quality of advertising and its efficiency.
Software Development Kits. These are blocks of code or algorithm similar to Tags and Pixels that are embedded into a digital resource that allows us to track certain information related to the application use, gathered during the process of utilizing our technology.
Other technologies: Please be aware that we use other technologies, including locally stored objects, to collect user information in order to assist users with the inventory delivery and to provide reporting to our clients or to evaluate the quality of advertisement.
How We Use User Information.
We primarily use the user information we collect to enable our clients to find and purchase advertising space. In particular, our clients use two types of information in order to deliver end users a targeted advertisement material: our client's information and information that we provide in the course of our services delivery. Those two types of information are usually synchronized and mutually filtered and checked to identify what are the main interests of the user, and what targeted advertisement materials should be sent to him or her based on all the information that we stated as collected in this section.
Additionally, we may use the information that we collect directly for our purposes: to create sophisticated advertising segments, to run analytics, including forecasting analytics of inventory, and to check the quality of advertisement or for any other and further research and development purposes acceptable as our legitimate business interests and allowed within the Romania. We constantly improve our algorithms targeting users with particular advertisement materials and/or inventory and measure the efficiency of advertisement materials. We use user information to improve our services and products that we provide to our clients, and to develop new products and services, to analyze the market, and generate performance reports. For above-mentioned purposes we may share information with our clients, partners, and service providers, taken, however, that all of the information sharing is done in aggregate without identifying particular users. Finally, we use user information to protect users, investigate security breaches, and to prevent all illegal activities within our systems.

Please be aware that if you gave your informed consent to our client you should contact that respective client. Moreover, if your consent was granted through the application, please withdraw your consent directly from that application.

Similarly, as soon as you withdraw your consent we will have to provide our clients with your personal information to make sure that your consent has been withdrawn throughout the entire system.
