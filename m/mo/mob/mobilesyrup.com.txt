Privacy Policy
MobileSyrup.com, (“We”, “Us”, “Our” etc.) believes that your personal information deserves protection and We subscribe to the privacy principles set out in the Government of Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act. This privacy policy describes Our practices regarding the collection, use and sharing of your personal information.

How do we collect and use personal information?
We are in the business of providing a forum for the useful exchange of information about products and services between Our users. As part of providing these services, We collect personal information from Our users in a number of ways.
Submissions and Emails
When you submit a deal or rebate through Our on-line form or via email, We will not post your email but will post the name you have provided with the submission. If you do not wish your name to be posted, you can indicate it in your submission or ask Us to remove your name from the posting. We may enter you into contests from time to time and would use your email to notify you if you are a winner.

Contests
From time to time, We may run contests for Our users, in which case We would use your email or private messages to notify you if you are a winner.

If you enter a contest, We will use your email address or other contact information to notify you if you are a winner. You may also have the option of providing additional information that is not related to awarding prizes for the contest. This information serves as a survey of Our users and enables Us to improve Our websites to better meet your preferences and to offer you products and services that may be of interest to you.

You may also choose to have Us display your email with your postings so that other users can contact you.
Polls
We may from time to time poll Our users on various matters of interest. If you vote in one of Our polls, We will record your answer to report to you which polls you have voted for and also to avoid allowing multiple votes by one person. Some polls may make your vote publicly available by displaying your user name alongside your vote to other users of Our websites. We indicate in advance what poll results are “private” and what poll results are “publicly available”.
Testimonials
We may wish, from time to time, to post your comments or submissions as sample testimonials from Our users, in which case We will ask for your permission in advance.
