Hosting
In order to operate the site and avoid misuse of the service the log file of the ISO 27001-certified server stores the IP address, the browser visitors use, the time and date of the visits, and the system that visitors use. Teh hoster Hetzner only stores pseudonymized IP addresses of visitors to the website. At the web server level, this happens by default by storing an IP address 123.123.123.XXX in the log file instead of the visitor’s actual IP address, for example, 123.123.123.123. The “XXX” is a random value between 1 and 254, so it is no longer possible to establish the true identity of the visitor.
