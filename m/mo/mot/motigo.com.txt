Meaning
Personal data are all the information concerning personal and factual relationships of an identified or identifiable person. This includes, for example, information and details such as your name, address or other postal address, your telephone number and your e-mail address.
Intended purposes
We collect personal data only when you have provided us with them and only to the extent and for the purpose for which you sent them to us, e.g. as part of the registration process or to process the contractual relationship with our company. Therefore we use and store your personal data only when you have expressly given us your informed consent and only to the extent, to which you have given you express permission, for example in accordance with the contractual relationship with our company. These details are stored by us on a specially protected server in Germany, and all the information on your identity are collected together by us only when you have expressly provided them to us.
Data protection
We have put in place a comprehensive range of technical and organisational measures to protect your data against possible risks, such as unauthorised access or seizure, unauthorised cognisance, modification or distribution, as well as against loss, destruction or mis-use. In order to protect your personal data from unauthorised access by third parties, when the data are being transferred, we secure data transfers , where necessary by means of SSL encryption. This is a standardised encryption procedure for on-line services, in particular for the Web.
If a contractual relationship exists between “Motigo” media and the Internet user (for example in a request for a newsletter), “Motigo” media shall process and use the data collected from the user to fulfil its obligations towards the user, insofar as this is necessary for this purpose.
“Motigo” media shall collect, process and use data for purposes going beyond the transaction and fulfilment of contractual relationships or relationships resembling contractual relationships, only where it has the express informed consent of the user and only to the extent permitted by this consent. Such purposes for the most part concern marketing and use the collected data inter alia as content for market research, customer acquisition, product information or developing the company's services.
“Motigo” media relies on the double opt-in solution: the user, who has given his informed consent to the use of his data for the stated purposes, confirms this consent in a second step. In this way “Motigo” media ensures that it is this user alone who is entering the data and who is releasing the data for use by “Motigo” media. In this way “Motigo” media respects the user's right to informational self-determination.

If “Motigo” media uses external servers or service providers to store user data, “Motigo” media ensures that these are under at least the same obligations as “Motigo” media itself.
“Motigo” media's employees are obliged to protect data secrecy and to observe data protection provisions. This obligation includes inter alia the fact that the employees may process and use the data only insofar as it is required as part of contractual relationships or relationships, which resemble contractual relationships or to the extent that the customer has given his informed consent to the use of his data for the respective purposes. Personal data, which are no longer needed on the part of “Motigo” media to fulfil the purposes of the contract and/or for which there is no (further) informed consent for further processing and use by “Motigo” media, are deleted in a manner, which excludes any possible mis-use.

The user can in this case assert his rights solely against “Motigo” media's cooperation partner.
If “Motigo” media collects data on behalf of cooperation partners and processes and uses these data, the cooperation partner is responsible for compliance with the provisions of data protection law. In this case “Motigo” media is not responsible to the user for compliance by the cooperation partner with the provisions of data protection law. No rights or duties of any kind whatsoever arise for “Motigo” media, arising from contracts or relationships resembling contracts, which the user has concluded with a cooperation partner. “Motigo” media may have no influence, either direct or indirect, on these contracts. In this case “Motigo” media is bound by directives as regards its cooperation partner.
