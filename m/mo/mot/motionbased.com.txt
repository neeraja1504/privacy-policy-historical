What information about me does MotionBased collect and how is it used?
MotionBased only collects personal information about you if you voluntarily choose to share it with MotionBased. MotionBased does not share, rent or sell information concerning MotionBased’s subscribers or other users of its website to third parties in ways other than disclosed in this privacy statement.
To use the core functionality of www.motionbased.com, you must first complete the registration form either at www.motionbased.com or at https://my.garmin.com/mygarmin/customers/myGarminHome.faces and open a free MotionBased Lite account. If you register at https://my.garmin.com/mygarmin/customers/myGarminHome.faces, then you will automatically be registered at www.motionbased.com. If you register at www.motionbased.com, then MotionBased will also register you at https://my.garmin.com/mygarmin/customers/myGarminHome.faces. During registration you will be required to provide personal information such as your name, and email address.
On the motionbased.com website there are several other opportunities for you to share personal information about yourself with MotionBased. This may include information about you such as your interests and activities, your biking and running routes, your name, and your mailing address and e-mail address. Submission of this information is strictly voluntary. MotionBased may also collect your credit card information if you choose to subscribe to MotionBased Standard. If you choose to share any personal information with MotionBased, MotionBased may store it and use it for internal marketing research and other marketing purposes, including e-mailing you with special promotions and other programs of interest. If the information is sent as part of a website evaluation, MotionBased may also use the information to contact you about your comments. If you opt-in for the MotionBased newsletter during registration, MotionBased will use your email address to send you newsletters with updates and news about MotionBased. You may remove your name from our email list by updating your Profile in the Account section or by emailing support@motionbased.com. MotionBased does not share, rent or sell your information to another company in ways other than disclosed in this privacy statement.
If you elect to use MotionBased’s referral service for informing a friend about www.motionbased.com or for emailing a trek to a friend, MotionBased will ask you for the friend’s email address. MotionBased will automatically send the friend a one-time email. MotionBased does not permanently store this information.
During the registration process, you will have the option to receive marketing offers from authorized third parties. This is made available to you so that you can learn of special offers that might appeal to you. If you later decide to stop receiving these emails, you may opt-out by contacting MotionBased at support@motionbased.com, by contacting the third party directly, or by changing your email preferences within your “Account Profile” on www.motionbased.com.
When you visit www.motionbased.com, a cookie will be stored on your computer. Generally, cookies work by assigning to your computer a unique number that has no meaning outside of MotionBased’s website. MotionBased’s cookies do not contain any personally identifying information; MotionBased uses them to provide features such as personalization, to save your member ID and to keep track of your shopping cart. MotionBased may also use cookies to assist it in delivering content specific to your interests. Additionally, after you’ve entered your member ID and password during a session on MotionBased’s website, MotionBased saves that information so you don’t have to re-enter it repeatedly during that session. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that. Not accepting cookies may make certain features of the MotionBased website unavailable to you. MotionBased may use your IP address to identify you, to administer MotionBased’s website and to assist in diagnosing problems with MotionBased’s server.
Like most standard Web site servers www.motionbased.com uses log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information.
As a result of displaying ad banners from third parties on www.motionbased.com, cookies from these advertisers may be stored on your computer when you visit www.motionbased.com. In addition, MotionBased uses Google Analytics as a method of tracking site statistics and user behavior on its website.
You may decide to send MotionBased personally identifying information in an e-mail message which might contain information or inquiries about MotionBased’s products or services. MotionBased will use this information to identify you as a MotionBased customer and to respond to the electronic mail. MotionBased will only use the information obtained to resolve the issue identified in the e-mail. MotionBased never sells e-mail addresses. You may change your personal information by contacting support@motionbased.com.
MotionBased may transfer personal information that you share within the Garmin group of companies in order to provide the products or services that you request. Except as specified above, MotionBased will only share your personal information with third parties if:
MotionBased has your consent;
MotionBased determines that it is required to do so by law; such as in response to a court order or subpoena.
MotionBased finds that you are in breach of its terms and conditions or any of its policies or usage guidelines for specific products or services;
it is necessary in MotionBased’s opinion to do so to prevent, investigate, detect or prosecute criminal offences or attacks on the technical integrity of MotionBased’s site(s) or its network;
it is necessary in MotionBased’s opinion to do so to protect the rights, property, or safety of MotionBased or its employees, the users of its website(s), or the public; or
it is necessary to fulfill your product or service order. MotionBased uses a credit card processing company to process your credit card information as required for your order and to ensure that your transaction is secure. This processing company does not retain, share, store or use your personally identifiable information for any other purposes.
What does MotionBased do to protect the data I transmit to MotionBased?
MotionBased’s website uses industry standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to allow for the encryption of personal information such as your name and address, as well as critically sensitive information such as your credit card number. MotionBased engages a company that is an industry leader in online security and site verification to ensure the security of MotionBased’s site. MotionBased’s website is also registered with site identification authorities so that your browser can confirm MotionBased’s identity before any personal information is sent. In addition, MotionBased’s secure servers protect this information using advanced firewall technology.
What does MotionBased do after it gets an order from me?
Not only does MotionBased protect your purchase-related information as it is transmitted to MotionBased’s servers, but MotionBased also secures the servers themselves to help prevent unauthorized access to the data after it is in MotionBased’s hands. MotionBased has comprehensive security measures in place to protect its Internet servers, as well as its internal corporate computer resources, from loss, misuse, and alteration. In addition, your credit card and billing information cannot be read as it travels to MotionBased’s ordering system.
What can I do to help make sure the security works correctly?
To help ensure that these measures are effective in preventing unauthorized access to your private information, you should be aware of the security features available to you through your browser. You should use a security-enabled browser to submit your credit card information and other personal information at www.motionbased.com. Please note: If you do not use a SSL-capable browser, you are at risk for having data intercepted. MotionBased will not be responsible for any compromise of data that is intercepted due to your use of an unsecured browser.
Most browsers have the ability to notify you if you change between secure and insecure communications, receive invalid site identification information for the site you are communicating with, or send information over an unsecured connection. MotionBased recommends that you enable these browser functions to help ensure that your communications are secure. You can also monitor the URL of the site you are visiting (secure URLs begin with https:// rather than the normal http://), along with the security symbol of your browser (an open or closed padlock in Netscape or a broken or complete key in Internet Explorer) to help identify when you are communicating with a secure server. You can also view the details of the security certificate of the site to which you are connected. MotionBased encourages you to use this to check the validity of any site you connect to using secure communications.
If my credit card company determines that there are fraudulent charges on my account, what should I do?
If your credit card company determines that there are fraudulent charges on your account that are the result of the use of your credit card at www.motionbased.com and they hold you liable for the unauthorized changes, please contact MotionBased immediately. You can contact MotionBased by e-mail at support@motionbased.com or postal mail:
