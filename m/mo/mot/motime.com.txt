The following text is extracted and transformed from the motime.com privacy policy that was archived on 2014-12-06. Please check the original snapshot on the Wayback Machine for the most accurate reproduction.
Our Privacy Policy is subject to the laws, regulations, and treaties of the United States and we make no representation our Services are operated in accordance with any other laws or regulations. If you live outside of The United States and you use or attempt to use our Service contrary to our Terms of Use that state that only United States residents are eligible, you do so at your own risk.
When you sign up, enroll, become a Subscriber, use our Service, or enter or participate in promotions or input information, you will generally be required to give us your wireless device number or email address, and certain other information, much of which is Personal Information. When you do or attempt to do any of these things, you understand, acknowledge and agree you are giving us your consent to track your use of our Service, your activities, exchanges of information and transactions in connection with our Service and you are giving us the right to use your Personal Information in connection with the Service. If, during the course of using or signing up for any of our Service, your use or enrollment also includes your consent to receive messages, we will always disclose this to you and give you the opportunity to opt out of receiving or continuing to receive these messages. You agree that we always have the right to send you messages in connection with your registration, subscription, any account you have with us and use of the Service.
We can change this Privacy Policy any time and from time to time by notifying you, either by posting an updated version on our Website or by sending you a message telling you we have made a change and when the changes become effective. Your continued use of our Service means that you agree with our updated Privacy Policy. It is your responsibility to check this Privacy Policy often because any changes we make and our notice to you will be considered effective, even if you choose not to check our Website for changes or read message we send you.
Personal Information we obtain from you or that you provide to us may be transferred, stored, maintained, processed and used both within and outside of The United States on servers, communication and data processing facilities that we maintain or are maintained for us (we refer to these individually and collectively as “servers”). For example, we currently have arrangements to use servers under the control of our affiliate company, DADA S.p.A., in Italy. These servers are presently located with Inet S.p.A., Via Darwin 55, Milan, Italy. So long as we continue to use these servers to process, store or transmit your Personal Information, we also ensure compliance with applicable Italian privacy law (D. Lgs 196/2003) in addition to our obligations under the laws of the United States.  Any Personal Information stored, maintained, processed or used in jurisdictions outside of The United States may be subject to disclosure to governing authorities in such jurisdictions pursuant to the laws of such jurisdictions. In certain cases, the laws of such jurisdictions may prohibit our providing notice of such disclosure to you.
By using our Service and providing us with your Personal Information, you consent to the transfer of your Personal Information to and from servers located in jurisdictions outside of The United States and waive any claims that may arise under United States law or any other local or national laws, rules or regulations or international treaties. You agree that we may from time to time, transfer or merge your Personal Information collected off-line to our online databases or store off-line information in an electronic format. You also agree that we may combine Personal Information we collect online with information available from other sources, including information received from our advertisers and promotional partners. This Privacy Policy applies to your Personal Information even if you terminate or discontinue your use of our Service.
Use of Information. By using the Service, you agree that we may use your Personal Information to tailor your experience on our Service, serve advertising we think may be relevant, understand your preferences, and provide you with offers we think may be of interest. It is your responsibility to give us current, complete, truthful and accurate information and to keep the Personal Information you provide us up to date. We reserve the right to revoke and/or terminate your right to use all or any portion of our Service and/or reject and delete any entry you make, if we have reason to believe information you provide to us is or may be false, fraudulent or inconsistent with this Privacy Policy or in violation of the Terms of Use. We are not liable in any way or responsible for damage that may arise if you do not give us accurate, truthful or complete information or you fail to update the information you give us. Unless we obtain your consent, we will not use your Personal Information for any purpose other than as listed above.

Cookies and Technology. We use computerized tracking technology (we will refer to these generally as “cookies”), often from third parties, to collect data regarding your visits and use of our Service. This data is stored in aggregate form and is not used to identify a particular user or individual. We use cookies in a variety of ways: (a) to save your User ID, wireless device number, email address and other information so you don’t have to re-enter it each time you use our Service; (b) to keep count of return visits to our Service and to advertisers’ or partners’ websites; (c) to accumulate and report aggregate statistical information in connection with our Service; and (d) to help us determine which Service you like best. Although we use aggregate tracking data to help us operate, manage, enhance, and improve our Service and display advertising and marketing information, Personal Information is not extracted in this process. You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent and you can choose to turn off all cookie mechanisms through settings in your browser, however, if you turn cookies off you may not have access to many features and functions of our Service that make your experience more efficient and enjoyable and some of our Service may not work properly or at all. When you use our Service, you understand you will be involved in communication that goes through computer networks and communication facilities, portions of which are or may in the future be located in a number of jurisdictions around the world. You also understand that use of our Service, as well as the nature of digital communication and services, may result in transmission of interprovincial and international communications no matter where you, any device, item of computer equipment, communications or network resources may be physically located. No communication over the Internet or wireless communication can be perfectly secure – there is always a risk.

You agree that we may share your Personal Information with any of our parent, subsidiaries and affiliated companies, as well as with our operational service providers that assist in providing our Service.

If you do opt in or consent you will be deemed to have given your consent to us and the third party involved to collect, maintain, process, store and use your Personal Information for the purposes described in the opt in or consent.

We maintain commercially reasonable standards of security and confidentiality, however, for most websites, wireless and mobile communications, it is possible third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. We conduct financial transactions via secured transmissions but may not always secure other parts of our Service in the same way. We also limit access to our Service by our own employees to individuals who are authorized and trained for the proper handling of such information. Any employee found violating our policies and standards of security and confidentiality will be subject to our disciplinary processes. We request our operational service providers follow the same policy.
