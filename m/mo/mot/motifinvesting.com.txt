Motif Terms of Use
Motif Investing respects the confidentiality of our customers’ non-public, personal information. It is our intention to ensure that this information is safeguarded to protect against its misuse. To that end, we are making available to you our Privacy Policy to remind you of our concern for and our efforts related to the protection of your personal non-public information.
Motif Investing As Introducing Broker
Motif Investing, acting as an introducing broker to its clearing broker Pershing LLC, carries the responsibilities for custody of your assets and transacting on your behalf. Information about Pershing’s role is available in our Customer Agreement. In addition, Pershing makes available its own Privacy Statement on the Motif Investing website, which you should review.
Personal Information
Personal information is information that we can use to identify you as an individual. This information can include your name, address, telephone number, Social Security number, date of birth and other information that is connected with your identity. We collect personal information in part to meet compliance with regulatory requirements, such as the specific information we gather about you on our account application and other forms. With a customer’s consent, we may contact other vendors such as credit bureaus to verify the customer’s identity. Motif Investing may also be required to protect our own legal rights in certain situations where we are trying to enforce a customer’s obligations to maintain a brokerage account in good order with us. In those cases, we are required to share limited information about you or your account, but require that the vendor maintain the information as confidential and not to repurpose the information for their own use in any way.
We are required to provide your personal information to agencies such as the IRS, securities regulatory agencies, and other regulatory government entities, and in certain cases, as required by law in response to judicial orders. Regulatory rules require broker-dealers like Motif Investing to retain personal information and records of account activity for defined periods of time that extend beyond the time you no longer maintain an active account with us.
In addition, we can collect other personal information to help enable us to identify needs our customers have and provide products and services designed to meet those needs. Motif Investing can use personal information collected from you for purposes such as:
responding to requests for specific products and services;
efforts to improve the design and content of the website or other features made available by the firm;
contacting you about new offers or enhancements to products and services.
We may share your information with third parties who help us in the delivery of our own products and services to you. We disclose information to companies and individuals we employ to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include hosting our Web servers, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, and providing customer service. These companies and individuals will have access to your personal information as necessary to perform their functions, but they may not share that information with any other third party.
Aggregate information is information that we collect in general about Motif Investing web site users on an anonymous basis. We may share aggregate demographic and usage information with business partners, advertisers and other third parties to enhance our ability to make improvements to our products and services or for other academic purposes.

Links
Motif Investing makes available links to other unrelated third-party sites as a convenience to allow you to easily access information that may be helpful or enhance your ability to manage your brokerage account. Keep in mind, those sites that you link to are sites of unaffiliated companies, which are governed by their separate privacy policy. This privacy policy applies only for the use of the Motif Investing website.

Motif Investing places your account information in a protected and secure portion of our website, and employ firewalls and security technology to protect our network and systems from external attacks. Motif Investing requires customers to enter a unique user name and password to access your account information online. Motif Investing utilizes SSL (Secure Socket Layer) technology to protect the security of the information, such as transactions, transmitted between your computer and our servers. You can always verify the identity of our web site because we use web server certificates that are signed by a trusted third party.

Motif Investing provides training to its staff, maintains procedures to monitor associate activities regarding access to customer information, and conduct examinations of our business practices in order to protect your personal information.
You can take steps as well to protect the security of your account information. Take care in selecting an appropriate password and change it regularly. Do not share your account and password information with anyone. While outside the privacy of an environment that you control, do not walk away from your computer while logged into your account. Use caution if using a public computer to access your account unless you can verify that it’s not capturing key strokes and that you can erase all of your information when you exit your account.

Motif Investing utilizes email as a primary source for communicating with you to notify you of information that is available that directly affects your account, such as the availability of trade confirmations and account statements, notification of corporate actions, transmitting certain account activity, and identifying account restrictions that can require immediate attention. We also use email as a tool to notify customers of enhancements to products and services and new offers. It is your responsibility to ensure that you maintain a current email address with Motif Investing, attend to it regularly, and notify us if there are any changes to be made to your email address.

Investing in securities involves risks, you should be aware of prior to making an investment decision, including the possible loss of principal. An investment in individual stocks, or a collection of stocks focused on a particular theme or idea, such as a motif, may be subject to increased risk of price fluctuation over more diversified holdings due to adverse developments which can affect a particular industry or sector. Investments in ETFs can include those with a narrow or targeted investment strategy and can be subject to similar sector risks than more broadly diversified investments. Motif makes no representation regarding the suitability of a particular investment or investment strategy. You are responsible for all investment decisions you make including understanding the risks involved with your investment strategy.
