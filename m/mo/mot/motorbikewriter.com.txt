What are Cookies?
The use of Cookies and similar technologies has for some time been commonplace and cookies in particular are important in the provision of many online services.
Cookie scope – Session Vs Persistent Cookies
Cookies can expire at the end of a browser session (from when a user opens the browser window to when they exit the browser) or they can be stored for longer.
Session cookies  – Allow websites to link the actions of a user during a browser session. They may be used for a variety of purposes such as remembering what a user has put in their shopping basket as they browse around a site. They could also be used for security when a user is accessing internet banking or to facilitate use of webmail. These session cookies expire after a browser session so would not be stored long term. For this reason, session cookies may sometimes be considered less privacy intrusive than persistent cookies.
Persistent cookies  – Are stored on a user’s device in between browser sessions which allows the preferences or actions of the user across a site (or in some cases across different websites) to be remembered. Persistent cookies may be used for a variety of purposes including remembering a user’s preferences and choices when using a site or to target advertising.
Cookie Sources – First Vs Third Party
Whether a cookie is ‘first’ or ‘third’ party refers to the website or domain placing the cookie.
First party cookies in basic terms are cookies set by a website visited by the user – the website displayed in the URL window.
Third party cookies are cookies that are set by a domain other than the one being visited by the user. If a user visits a website and a separate company sets a cookie through that website this would be a third party cookie.
