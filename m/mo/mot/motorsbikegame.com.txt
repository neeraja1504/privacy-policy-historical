How We Collect Information
The technology we use to collect your information is not different than the kind used on most public websites. This includes cookies that can identify the kind of device you are using as well as the type of browser you have installed on your system. A browser cookie is a small piece of code that is received by your computer by the website you are visiting. This data is stored on the web browser, and the site can access this data in order to retrieve information about your browsing habits. This information goes back to the server, which can use it to modify or customize the website during your visit. It can track the items you place in a shopping cart, for example. This data is useful for customizing the content of the website in order to reflect your preferences.
Your web browser is capable of enhancing your privacy, but certain settings may restrict the type of content you see on your screen. If you attempt to use one of our online games unsuccessfully, you might need to adjust the settings on your browser first. If you wish to block tracking cookies, for example, you can go into the options panel and turn off these cookies in the background. However, this could disable certain features on the gaming website that allow it to function properly. After you adjust these settings, additional information may be transmitted about your activity on our website. This can allow us to customize or improve your user experience.
Other Information We Collect
In addition to using session cookies, persistent cookies or session management cookies, our site may also use information provided from these cookies to reveal your IP address or other personally identifying information. Because of the interactive nature of our site, this information is invaluable for customizing user content and creating a memorable gaming experience. We strive to balance these benefits with privacy controls, so you can use our site safely and securely. This privacy policy explicitly prohibits us from using your information for any other purpose. This means that we will not sell your data to third-party companies, advertising agencies or unauthorized users.
We use the latest security protocols to protect your privacy, and these protocols conform to the highest standards in the industry. For example, we use an encryption technology called Secure Socket Layers, or SSL, which is designed to protect information packets traveling through the Internet. This is an integral part of our privacy protocol, and we encourage all of our online gaming customers to become familiar with SSL and how it works. The SSL security protocol protects your information from being intercepted while traveling between a client computer and a server. We take all aspects of our privacy policy very seriously, and we update the information as new laws are passed that place regulatory requirements on online companies in the gaming industry.

We follow the best practices in this industry, which includes the physical security of our servers as well as our internal controls. Our company is proud to provide users with an enhanced experience of online gaming that is safe and secure at all times. However, it is also necessary to advise users to consider the nature of the Internet, which makes it impossible to guarantee that all of your data will be secure at all times. Even in this environment, we are committed to doing everything possible to enhance the security of your data, so you can enjoy the gaming experience with peace of mind.
