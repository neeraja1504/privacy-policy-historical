You may also provide personal information to us when you contact us by email, telephone or letter. We may collect information about you from documents that are available to the public, such as the electoral register, or from third parties such as credit reference agencies.

Information Security
We store your personal information in limited access servers, and will maintain commercially reasonable safeguards to make sure your information is kept securely. Although we strive to keep member profiles secure, no security measures are absolute or fool-proof, and there is always a possibility that a security breach could occur, resulting in the release of information stored on a member profile.
Sharing of your personal information
Motilo Limited may share your personal information with third parties in the following ways:
We sometimes use agents and service providers to process personal information on our behalf. For example, we use third parties to send postal mail, to process credit card payments and to maintain our IT systems. Where we use agents and service providers to process your personal information, we will ensure that they have adequate security measures in place to keep your personal information safe.
If we are required to do so for legal or regulatory purposes or as part of legal proceedings, then we will need to release your personal information.
If we decide to sell one or more or our businesses, we may need to give information we hold about you to other companies or individuals as part of this process.
We will pass your personal information to carefully selected third parties so that they can contact you about products or services that they think may interest you. We will not pass your information to third parties for marketing purposes if you have told us that you do not want us to do this at the point where you provide your information to us on the website.
In some circumstances we may transfer your personal information to countries outside of the European Economic Area, where data protection safeguards are not as high as they are in the UK. If this occurs we will ensure that adequate procedures are put into place to keep your personal information safe.
Member profiles
We may allow other users or visitors to our website to see your profile and the information you have provided on the site. We may also allow other users or visitors to our website to look through your community friends lists and other information listed in your profile.
You are free to unsubscribe from the our services and request that we remove your member profile from our databases. However, so that we can resolve disputes, assist with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental requests or investigations, and due to technical constraints, we may need to keep your personal information in certain circumstances.
Use of our online forums
Any personal information or content that you voluntarily upload to the website or disclose online (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, within your public profile page, etc.) becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by others. Any content that you submit to the website may be redistributed through the internet and other media channels, and may be viewed by the general public. If you e-mail someone else a video or other special feature from the website, we may use the information you provide about someone else to send that person the requested e-mail.

What are cookies
Cookies are tiny text files stored on your computer when you visit certain web pages. At Motilo we use cookies to allow you to create & save looks, keep track of what you have in your basket, and to remember you when you return to our site.
To use Motiloâ€™s website, you need to have cookies enabled. If you don't wish to enable cookies, you'll still be able to browse the site and use it for research purposes. Most web browsers have cookies enabled, but see Managing cookies for help to turn them on should you need to.
Please note that cookies can't harm your computer. We don't store personally identifiable information such as credit card details in cookies we create, but we do use encrypted information gathered from them to help improve your experience of the site. For example, they help us to identify and resolve errors, or to determine relevant related products to show you when you're browsing.
