MOTUS PRIVACY NOTICE
Effective: August 7, 2018
INTRODUCTION
This Privacy Notice explains how Motus, LLC (“Motus” or “we”) collects, uses, shares, and handles information about Users of the Motus website, mobile app, and other services (collectively, “Motus Services”).  For example, Users include mobile workers who use the Motus app to track mileage for reimbursement from their employers.  By visiting Motus.com or using any Motus Service, Users accept the practices described in this Privacy Notice and consents to the collection, use and disclosure of information described herein.
Motus collects Users’ information on behalf of Users’ employers or other companies that engage the services of Users (collectively, “Motus Clients”).  Users may be direct employees or independent contractors of Motus Clients.  Users also may be direct employees or independent contractors of Motus Clients’ Permitted Affiliates, as defined in the Motus Master Services Agreement.
As Motus evolves, we may update this Privacy Notice to reflect changes in the manner in which we deal with personal information, whether to comply with then applicable regulations and self-regulatory standards or otherwise. The Privacy Notice posted here will always be current. We encourage you to review this statement regularly.  If we make a material change to the Privacy Policy, we will notify you via e-mail at your most recent e-mail address on record and post a notice of the change on our website, motus.com.
This Privacy Notice does not limit collection, use, sharing, or handling by Motus of aggregated, de-identified, or anonymized information, provided that the information cannot be associated with an individual.
If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Notice, e-mail Motus at privacy@motus.com.
INFORMATION WE COLLECT
Motus collects User information from Users and Clients in order to administer and provide Motus Services to Motus Clients and Users and for the other purposes identified in this Privacy Notice. Information that may be collected includes:
Name
Email address
Telephone number
Date of birth
Gender
Employer name
Vehicle and car insurance information
Bank account data
Website log and user agent data such as Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, metadata, and the date and time that you accessed Motus Services
Mobile device type and operating system information
Precise location information (described below)
Information collected via cookies and web beacons (described below),
Miles driven
Simple web page actions
If your employer has so requested and you have completed the consent web form, Motor Vehicle Records (“MVRs”). Note that when obtaining these records, Motus only collects MVRs, not credit checks, criminal reports, or personal interviews.
Any other information that Users or Clients choose to communicate to Motus (such as sending information to Motus via e-mail, app, or a Web form).
To deliver some services, such as mileage reimbursement, Motus may collect precise location information related to a User’s location and route.  Motus will only collect precise location information if a User affirmatively opts in to such collection via both the mobile device operating system settings and the settings on the Motus Service.  For instance, in order for a User to allow the Motus app to collect precise location information on the User’s iPhone, the User must take two steps.  First, the User must allow Motus to access location information via the iPhone’s Privacy settings.  Second, the User must enable location collection via the settings on the Motus app.  Users may choose to enable a Motus Service to automatically collect geolocation information during specific timeframes each day.  Users also could manually start and stop precise geolocation data collection via the “Start” and “Stop” buttons, or similar options, on the Motus service. Please note that the exact settings for precise location information collection vary by mobile operating system.
Motus Services are not directed to children under the age of 13. Motus does not knowingly collect or store personal information about children under the age of 13.
If a User would like to review or request changes to his or her information that is collected through a Motus Service (subject to certain exceptions prescribed by law), the User may email privacy@motus.com.
HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION
We use the User information that we collect to administer and provide our services to Motus Clients and Users.  We may use User information for the following purposes:
Maintaining, providing, repairing, personalizing, understanding, and improving Motus Services, including but not limited to mileage reimbursement, fleet management, mileage tracking, billing, insurance processing, and business intelligence;
Processing transactions with Motus Clients and Users, such as billing and processing account information;
Communicating with Users about Motus Services and affiliated third party services, via methods such as e-mail notifications;
Preventing potentially illegal activities, or activities that potentially violate the Motus Master Service Agreement or Terms of Use;
Responding to the inquiries of Motus Clients and Users;
Complying with IRS (CRA in Canada) and employer mileage reimbursement guidelines; and
For any other purpose to which you consent at the time that your information is collected.
SHARING INFORMATION
If Motus collects User information on behalf of a Motus Client, it may share any of that User information with that Motus Client. For example, if Jane Doe uses the Motus app to track her car’s mileage for her employer, ABC Company, Motus may share any information that the Motus app collects about Jane Doe with ABC Company.
Additionally, under the following circumstances, Motus may provide third parties with the information that it has collected from a User, provided that the sharing is conducted for one of the following purposes:
To obtain services from Motus third-party service providers.  Examples of such third-party services include technical support, analytics, insurance quotes, insurance processing services, fuel prices, and motor vehicle record information.
To comply with legal requirements and respond to lawful court orders and other valid legal process;
To protect the rights, property, or safety of Motus or others, or to assist in the investigation of fraud or any other unlawful activity;
As part of a merger, partial or complete acquisition, bankruptcy, asset sale, financing, consolidation, restructuring, liquidation, or similar corporate transaction.  In the event of a corporate transaction that would result in the transfer of User information, Motus would inform Users via their most recent e-mail address on record with Motus and a prominent notice on the Motus.com website;
To transfer any aggregate or anonymized information, provided that no individual could be identified by the information;
Under any other circumstance to which the User consents after being notified.
