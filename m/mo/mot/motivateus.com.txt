What information of yours does the Motivating Moments collect & How is it Used?
Information collected online is usually defined as being either anonymous or personally identifiable.
Anonymous information refers to data that cannot be tied back to a specific individual. For example, Motivating Moments LLC collects some information each time a visitor comes to our website. Motivating Moments LLC collects the visitor's IP address (e.g., whether the user is logged on from att.com or aol.com), referral data (e.g., the Internet address of the last Web page visited by a user before clicking over to our website site), and browser and platform type (e.g., a Netscape browser on a Windows platform). Motivating Moments LLC collects this user information for purposes of website monitoring, improvement, and targeted advertising. You do not have to register with the Motivating Moments LLC before we can collect this anonymous information.
Personally identifiable information refers to data that tells us specifically who you are, such as your name and email address, which may be collected in addition to the anonymous data described above. Motivating Moments LLC collects personal information in the following ways from different parts of its Web site:
Log Files

Voluntary Customer Surveys
We may periodically conduct both visitor and member surveys.

Your personal information and responses will remain strictly confidential, even if the survey is conducted by a third party. Participation in our surveys is voluntary.
We take the information we receive from individuals and members responding to our Surveys and combine (or aggregate) it to create broader, generic responses to the survey questions (such as gender, age, geographic location, hobbies, education, employment, industry sector, or other demographic information).
