Privacy Policy | Motion Picture Association
INTRODUCTION
Last Updated : September 18, 2019
We at the Motion Picture Association, Inc., along with our subsidiaries and affiliates listed here (collectively, the “MPA”) respect your concerns about privacy. This Privacy Policy describes the types of personal information we collect about individuals (other than MPA personnel), how we use the information, with whom we may share it and the choices available to you regarding our use of the information. We also describe the measures we take to protect the security of the information and how you can contact us about our privacy practices.
This Privacy Policy applies to the general practices of the MPA with respect to its processing of personal information, as well as to the MPA’s websites listed here (collectively, the “Sites”). The Policy does not apply to websites or mobile apps operated by the MPA that have separate privacy policies or notices that do not reference this Policy.
Our privacy practices may vary among the countries in which we operate to reflect local practices and legal requirements. You can view certain country-specific information by clicking here.
INFORMATION WE MAY OBTAIN
We may obtain information about you in various ways, such as through our Sites, registration or copyright infringement forms, copyright owners, or the Internet. The types of information we collect include:
Contact information (such as name, postal and email address and telephone number);
login credentials;
employer ID numbers or other government-issued identification numbers in connection with economic impact analyses we perform;
information about movies and television shows that may interest you (such as titles of trailers you search for or watch);
information we obtain in connection with a career opportunity at MPA, such as contact details, information in your application and resume, and details about your current employment; and
other personal information in content you provide to us, such as through emails you send us.
Content Protection
We obtain and share certain personal information to detect, investigate and deter the unauthorized copying, viewing, use, distribution and sale of protected and copyrighted motion pictures. For these purposes, we may obtain personal information from third-party information services companies, the Internet (including social media sites), public registers, law enforcement authorities and others.
We may obtain certain personal information in connection with our content protection activities that we typically do not collect in connection with our other activities covered by this Privacy Policy. To the extent permitted by applicable law, this information may include nicknames, personal characteristics (such as age, gender, marital status), family composition, bank or PayPal account details, details of suspected infringement of copyright and other protections, social media account information, employment information (including job position), education and training, images, web domains registered by an individual, automobile/motorcycle registration and license plate information, and information regarding litigation that has been submitted to courts, tribunals or administrative judicial bodies. We also, to the extent permitted by applicable law, collect personal data about any suspected or actual criminal activity that we are investigating (such as criminal copyright infringement). We can process such personal data pursuant to the 2018 Belgian Data Protection Act.
Information We Obtain By Automated Means
When you visit our Sites, open our emails or interact with MPA-related tools, widgets or plug-ins, we may collect certain information (including IP addresses) by automated means, such as cookies, web server logs, web beacons and JavaScript.
Cookies are files that websites send to your computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify your browser or to store information or settings on your device. Our Sites may use cookies (such as HTTP and HTML5 cookies), as well as other types of local storage (such as browser-based or plugin-based local storage). Your browser may tell you how to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies and how to restrict or disable certain cookies. Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to use all of the features of our Sites or other websites and online services.
In conjunction with gathering information through cookies, our web servers may log information such as your device type, operating system type, browser type, domain, and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone where your device is located. We also may record information such as the address of the web page that referred you to our Sites and the IP address of the device you use to connect to our Sites. We may log information about your interaction with the Sites, such as which pages you visit. To control which web servers collect information by automated means, we may place tags on our web pages called “web beacons,” which are small files that link web pages to particular web servers and their cookies. We also may send instructions to your device using JavaScript or other computer languages to gather the sorts of information described above and other details about your interactions with the Site.
We may use third-party web analytics services on our Sites, such as those of Google Analytics. These service providers help us analyze how visitors use the Sites. The information obtained for this purpose (including your IP address and other information collected by automated means) will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers. To learn about opting out of Google Analytics, please click here.
The providers of third-party plug-ins and widgets on our Sites, such as embedded videos and social media sharing tools, may use automated means to collect information regarding your use of the Sites and your interactions with the plug-ins and widgets. This information is subject to the privacy policies or notices of the providers of the plug-ins and widgets.
To the extent required by applicable law, we will obtain your consent before collecting personal information using cookies or similar automated means.
HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE OBTAIN
We may use the information described above to:
provide products and services to you;
send you promotional materials, newsletters and other communications;
create and manage your account;
communicate with you about, and administer your participation in, special events, film screenings, programs, promotions, offers, surveys, focus groups and market research;
respond to your inquiries;
perform data analyses (including market and consumer research, economic impact analyses, demographic analyses and anonymization and aggregation of personal information);
manage career opportunities at MPA, including for recruitment purposes, employee onboarding and other HR purposes;
operate, evaluate and improve our business (including developing new products and services; enhancing, improving and analyzing our products and services; managing our communications; and performing accounting, auditing and other internal functions);
protect against, identify and prevent fraud, copyright infringement, unauthorized use and distribution of protected content and other criminal activity; and
comply with and enforce applicable legal requirements, relevant industry standards and our policies, including our Terms of Use.
In addition, we use information collected through cookies, web beacons, web server logs and other automated means for purposes such as (i) customizing our users’ visits to our Sites, (ii) delivering content tailored to our users’ interests and the manner in which our users browse our Sites, and (iii) managing our Sites and other aspects of our business.
We also may use the information in other ways for which we provide specific notice at the time of collection, and obtain consent to the extent required by law.
Interest-Based Advertising
If you are a U.S. resident, we may collect information on our websites about your online activities to provide you with advertising about products and services tailored to your interests. This section of our Privacy Policy provides details and explains how to exercise your choices.
You may see our ads on other websites because we participate in advertising networks. Ad networks allow us to target our messaging to users considering demographic data, users’ inferred interests and browsing context. These networks track users’ online activities over time by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of cookies, web server logs, web beacons and other similar technologies. The networks use this information to show ads that may be tailored to individuals’ interests, to track users’ browsers or devices across multiple websites, and to build a profile of users’ online browsing activities. The information our ad networks may collect includes data about users’ visits to websites that participate in the relevant ad networks, such as the pages or ads viewed and the actions taken on the websites. This data collection takes place both on our websites and on third-party websites that participate in the ad networks. This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.
To learn how to opt out of ad network interest-based advertising in the U.S., please visit www.aboutads.info/choices, http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/,
and http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/. Our Sites are not designed to respond to “do not track” signals from browsers.
INFORMATION WE SHARE
We do not disclose personal information we obtain about you, except as described in this Privacy Policy. We may share your personal information with the entities listed in Appendix B, and/or with their respective affiliates or subsidiaries. We also may share personal information with service providers who perform services on our behalf based on our instructions. We do not authorize these service providers to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements. Examples of these service providers include web hosting providers, analytics services, email list management providers, registrars, registries, ad networks, payment processors, online platforms, content protection organizations, office services providers, accountants and law firms.
We also may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law or legal process, (ii) to law enforcement authorities or other government entities based on a lawful disclosure request, or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent harm or financial loss, or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual fraudulent or illegal activity. We reserve the right to transfer personal information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets.
Information collected through third-party plug-ins and widgets on the Sites (such as information relating to your use of a social media sharing tool) is collected directly by the providers of the plug-ins and widgets. This information is subject to the privacy policies of the providers of the plug-ins and widgets, and the MPA is not responsible for those providers’ information practices.

If you are located in the European Economic Area (the “EEA”), the following EEA-specific provisions apply to our processing of your personal information in addition to or in lieu of the relevant sections of the Privacy Policy:
We rely on the following legal bases under applicable law toprocess your personal information:
If you have consented to such processing;
Where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are party or in order to take steps prior to entering into such a contract;
Where it is necessary to comply with a legal obligation to which we are subject; or
Where it is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interest, such as to prevent, identify and protect against fraud, copyright infringement, unauthorized use and distribution of protected content and other criminal activity. We have balanced our legitimate interests against your data protection rights. You can contact us as described in the “How to contact us” section above if you would like more information on how we balance our legitimate interests.
Some of the data recipients identified in the Privacy Policy are located outside the EEA, including injurisdictions that have not been recognized by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of data protection. In particular, we share your personal information with affiliates and subsidiaries, and potentially with service providers that process personal information on our behalf, located in the following countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Japan, Mexico, Singapore, and South Korea. In addition, your personal information may be transferred to other countries where we carry out content protection activities. The countries to which we transfer personal data will depend on where the particular infringer(s) reside and the country where we need to take action. As these countries may not offer the same level of protection as the countries within the EEA, we ensure that appropriate safeguards aimed at ensuring such a level of data protection are in place as required by applicable law, including by selecting service providers that are certified to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework for which the European Commission has issued an Adequacy Decision pursuant to article 45 of the GDPR, or executing appropriate data transfer agreements with our service providers.

Where we have obtained your consent for the processing of your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. This will not affect the lawfulness of the processing that has happened based on your consent prior to the withdrawal.
To exercise these rights or withdraw consent, please contact us using the contact details set out in the “How To Contact Us” section, above.
