Privacy considerations
We do not use cookies or any method of detecting your e-mail address from your web browser. The IP address you visit from is temporarily logged, but this information is used only for improving and building our content. This information is never distributed to outside companies. EXCEPTION: cookies are used by the Rate-It feature in our Motivational Links Directory and by the Surveys. The sole purpose of these cookies is to keep people from stuffing the ballot box. No cookie information is collected or viewed by MotivationalQuotes.Com or any of their advertisers. Users of the Forums may choose to have their username and password saved in a cookie for their convenience. This is completely optional.
When you sign up for one of our mailing lists, you can be assured that your address will be treated confidentially. We review only the number of subscribers, but never look at the actual subscription list unless we need to assist someone in unsubscribing from a list. We never sell our mailing lists or subscriber names to outside companies for any reason.
Our mailing lists are all OPT-IN. No one is ever signed up for a list against their wishes by MotivationalQuotes.Com. In addition, we have taken as many steps as possible to deter malicious subscriptions. If however, you feel you were subscribed to one of our lists against your wishes, we will work with you to remove your address as quickly as possible. Please send a copy of the mailing you received from the list along with your email address(es) and alias(es) to expedite the process.
We do not collect names or addresses from any of the interactive content on our site, such as guestbook, forums, or virtual postcards. We do not, however, have any control over spiders that may visit to harvest addresses.
If you have a privacy concern that has not been addressed here, please contact us.
