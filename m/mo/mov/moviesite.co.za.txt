The MovieSite â€” Privacy policy
We value your privacy.
We hate spam just as much as you do.
So we do not and will not release your email address or any other personal details to anyone else outside this web site without your permission.
Your email address is used only for sending out the regular mailings about updates to this site, if you subscribed. Email addresses supplied when you submit a movie rating are sometimes used to verify that it was indeed you who submitted an opinion, and then deleted.
Any personal information collected (in competition entries, for example) is used solely for statistical purposes. If we have a good idea of the ages, genders, etc. of our visitors, we can tailor the content better for you.
Note however that if you supply your age when submitting a movie review or rating, we will include your age next to your name if we publish your rating or review. This is so that other visitors can better judge whether your comment or rating has relevance for them or not. If you are sensitive about your age, and for some reason are convinced that you are the only individual in the whole universe with your particular first name and surname combination, then do not include it when submitting a rating or review.
Advertising
The site carries advertisements from various sources. Some of these advertisement delivery systems will want to set cookies on your computer. Some browsers offer you the option of managing which cookies you accept, and you are free to use those options.
Google ads (AdSense) has the ability to track your web site visits, and tailor advertising to suit what it thinks are your interests. You can either decline the Google cookies, or opt out here.
You can also visit Privacy Choice to opt out of a lot of different ad services at once.
