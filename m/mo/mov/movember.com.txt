4. How visible is my information?
In certain circumstances we may give you the option to limit the public view of your information, for example:
Your Mo Space - you have the option to select a limited public view Mo Bro or Mo Sista Mo Space.
Your Mo Team - your Mo Team Captain will be able to access your email address and the email addresses of any member of your Mo Team.
Your Movember event – you have the option to select limited view for any Movember event you create.
Changing the default settings in your Mo Space to Limited Public View and your Movember event to Limited View mean that we will endeavor to ensure that your Mo Space and/or Movember event is not available to general internet search engines and is inaccessible by a general search of our Services.  Your Mo Space will also not be displayed on your public team page (if you are part of a team) or network page (if you are part of a network).
However, you should also be aware that your limited public view Mo Space will be available as follows:
* to users that search for you in the “Donate” section of the Movember Services;
* if you belong to a team, then your team members that are logged in will be able to view your Mo Space; and
* through a direct link to your Mo Space.
You should also be aware that a Movember event set to Limited View will be visible if shared via social media.
Please be aware that if you change your Mo Space from public to a limited public view , and/or your Movember event from public to limited view your Mo Space and/or Movember event may have already been indexed by a search engine and may therefore appear in searches conducted on that search engine until it re-indexes your Mo Space and/or Movember event. In some cases the search engines do not re-index their searches so your Mo Space and/or Movember event may still appear on those search engines after you have changed your profile settings. If you have a concern that a particular search engine hasn’t removed your Mo Space and/or Movember event from their search results please contact us at info.us@movember.com and we will contact the search engine directly to request deletion of the reference to your Mo Space and/or Movember event in their search results.
Your donations - you have the option to make:
a private donation , in which case your name and amount of your donation will only be disclosed to the recipient in their private view of their Mo Space, however your donation amount will be included in the total calculation on their Mo Space; and
an anonymous donation , in which case the amount of your donation will be displayed on the recipient’s public and private view of their Mo Space but your name will not be displayed in either the public or private view of the recipient’s Mo Space.
5. Communication preferences:
Where you have agreed to receive Movember emails, Movember may use your personal information to send you emails (including marketing emails) about the Movember campaign, associated activities and the outcomes achieved with the funds raised.  If you are a registered Mo Bro or Mo Sista, Movember will automatically send you an email whenever there is activity on your Mo Space or confirmation of donations you have received.  You will be provided with an opportunity in each email communication to decline to receive any further communications from Movember.  In addition, you can change your email marketing preferences in the settings in the “My Account” > “Notifications" section on your Mo Space.
6. Disclosure of Personal Information:
Personal information collected by Movember may be shared with any company within the Movember group of companies and any of its authorised licensees.

When we contract external services providers, we may provide them with your personal information, but only to the extent required for them to fulfil that contract, or where you would reasonably expect Movember to disclose it to a third party for a particular purpose.
Regardless of where in the world you reside, Movember may transfer your data outside of your own country, including to Australia and the United States, for processing, including analytics, and storage.  This may result in your data being transferred to a country which has a lower standard of data protection than the country in which you reside.  Wherever your data is transferred, it may be accessed by the courts, regulatory bodies, and law enforcement and national security authorities, according to the laws in the relevant jurisdiction.
We may disclose your personal information to social media platforms including, without limitation, Facebook so that the social media platforms may send you advertisements about future Movember events and initiatives and for analytics purposes.
If we send your details to Facebook they will be hashed before they are sent, and Facebook only briefly uses the data for matching purposes then deletes it: https://www.facebook.com/ads/manage/customaudiences/tos.php

7. Security & storage of your information:
Movember takes reasonable steps to ensure the security of all information it collects, including that the information is protected from misuse and loss and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.
