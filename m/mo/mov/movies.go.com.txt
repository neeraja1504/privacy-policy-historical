Your use of our websites and our other services are subject to binding individual arbitration of any disputes which may arise, as provided in theTerms and Policies. Please read the arbitration provisions of the Terms and Policies carefully and do not use the Online Services if you are unwilling to arbitrate any disputes you may have with us as provided in our Terms and Policies.
1. TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU
There are two main types of information we collect about users of the Online Services:
"Personally Identifiable Information" is information that identifies you, and may include for example your full (i.e., first and last) name, phone number, email address, postal address, or credit or other payment card number, and photos of you or other individuals.
"Non-Personally Identifiable Information" is information that relates to you or your computer or device but does not on its own identify you. Non-Personally Identifiable Information relates to information about you, or the computer or mobile device you use to access the online Services, but doesn't identify you personally. This information may include (for example), information about your use of the Online Services, including web pages you have visited, apps you have downloaded, parts or functions of the Online Services you have used or viewed, gameplay data, content you have accessed or viewed, advertising sent to you or that you have viewed, transaction history, IP address and device identifiers, information about your Internet connection, information about the equipment or software you use to access the Online Services, and information you provide to or post on message boards or chat rooms that are part of the Online Services.
2. HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM YOU
We collect information about you in three main ways:
Directly from you, when you provide it to us: for example, when you register with the website, download an app, sign up for email or text alerts, buy movie tickets or make other purchases via the Online Services, request products or services, respond to surveys, contact us or otherwise interact with us. Please remember that if others use devices into which you remain logged in, they may share information with us as if they were you, and they may have access to information that you have previously provided us. To protect your privacy, please log out from the Online Services you use on shared devices.
Automatically, when you use our Online Services : we collect information through the use of cookies and similar technologies, through logging your activities on the Online Services, and when you download our mobile applications. Please see our Cookies and Tracking Technologies Information Center, and Mobile Apps Information Center for further information, including your choices in relation to the use of these technologies.
From third parties : we may obtain information about you from third parties outside of the Online Services—this Privacy Policy will not apply to that information. When you sign-on to the Online Services or otherwise interact with social networks or if you interact with us through a social media function such as a plug-in (for example, a Facebook "like" button) then you may be permitting us to have on-going access to some information from your social network profile (such as your name, email address, your friend list, photo, age, gender, location, birthday, social networking ID, current city, the people/sites you follow, and so forth). We may also obtain information about you from a third party data aggregator, cookie technology operator, advertising network, or another type of data company.
3. HOW WE USE INFORMATION ABOUT YOU
We (and our service providers) may use the information we collect about you for a variety of business purposes. For example, we may use that information to:
Provide the services and products you have requested;
Create an account on the Online Services if you have requested one;
Personalize the services we offer and the advertising displayed through the Online Services (see options for opting-out of personalized advertising at our Cookies and Tracking Technologies Information Center);

Service Providers that We Have Retained to Perform Certain Business-Related Functions on Our Behalf: For example, our service providers may offer services such as research, analytics, hosting websites, fulfilling transactions, maintaining databases, administering contests, providing technology services and platforms, deliveries, and processing payments. We may also need to share information with other companies in order to enable the uses described above in “How We Use Information About You” or elsewhere in this Privacy Policy. Typically, when these companies are provided with Personally Identifiable Information they are only provided with that Personally Identifiable Information they need to perform their functions and that Personally Identifiable Information can only be used as is necessary to perform the services on our behalf, or to comply with legal requirements. Similarly, where appropriate, we often take steps to require third-party service providers to protect Personally Identifiable Information.
Third Parties who Separately Have Your Information: We may share information about your use of the Online Services with third parties to whom you separately provide (or to whom you already separately have provided) your Personally Identifiable Information (e.g., if you establish or have established accounts with them). In these instances, we may enhance the data they have about you by using or sharing a common identifier that itself is not Personally Identifiable Information.

Loyalty Program Operators : Our services offer the ability for consumers to link their Fandango account with the loyalty rewards programs of certain theaters, venue operators, event promoters, movie studios or other companies offering loyalty reward programs. When you indicate that you'd like such a link to occur, we may share transaction information or other information (including Personally Identifiable Information) pertaining to you with the applicable program operator.
Social Networks: You may interact with certain features of the Online Services that cause information to be published to your social networks. Or, you may sign up for features on the Online Services or a social network that are designed to require that we provide to the social network, or the social network provide to us, information, which may include Personally Identifiable Information, to associate our records relating to you in our data base with the records that social network has relating to you in their database, so that they or we can contact you or tailor messages to you, or otherwise.

Opt-Ins: In some places on our Online Services we may place opt-ins where you can select to receive communications from companies with whom we have promotional relationships.

Legal Reasons: We may use or disclose information to cooperate with or enlist the support of law enforcement, government or regulatory bodies, content protection organizations or judicial processes with respect to, or to prevent, suspected or possible fraud or other suspected or possible illegal activities.

5. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT HOW WE USE AND SHARE INFORMATION ABOUT YOU
We may work with third party ad networks and consumer data companies to help present ads through the Online Services or to help us evaluate and provide us with information about the use of the Online Services and viewing of our ads and other content. These third parties may view, edit or set their own tracking technologies/cookies, which will allow them to collect information about how you interact with content and advertising while you are using the Online Services and while you are on other third party platforms where their tracking technologies are located. The use of these technologies by these third parties is subject to their own privacy policies and is not covered by this Privacy Policy.
If you do not want to receive the benefits of targeted advertising, you may opt out of some network advertising programs that use your information by visiting the NAI Opt-out page or the DAA Opt-out page. Please note that even if you choose to remove your information (opt out), you will still see advertisements while you're browsing online. However the advertisements you see may be less relevant to you. Please note that if you opt-out of targeted advertising, we may still track your visits to the Online Services for our own analytics, operations and security purposes
