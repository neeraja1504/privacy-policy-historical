Privacy Policy – moxtra | a mobile first, embeddable collaboration platform
Moxtra, Inc. (“Moxtra”) is committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring you have a positive experience on our website and in using our products and services (collectively “Products”). Moxtra provides a collaboration service that enables users to share and annotate documents and other materials and to communicate via messaging and web meetings.  Moxtra also licenses its collaboration technology to third-party developers to embed in their own applications (“Moxtra-enabled Apps”).  This policy covers the Moxtra website and Products and is applicable worldwide and information collected by Moxtra from Moxtra-enabled Apps. This policy outlines our personal information handling practices for both online and offline data.
This privacy policy describes the types of personal information we collect and process, how we use it, how long we keep it, when it is shared, how you can manage it, and how we secure it.
If you give us personal information, we will treat it according to this policy. This policy may be updated from time to time and our website will indicate when the policy has been updated. You may access the current version at any time by clicking on the “Privacy Policy” link at the footer on our website.  In some agreements with our customers and licensees, we may have provisions related to handling of personal information which may supersede the provisions of this privacy policy.
What kinds of information do we collect?
We collect a variety of “Personal Information” which can include information that can be used to identify an individual, such as name, email address, postal or other physical address and job title.  We collect such information from users of our Products.  In connection with billing customers, we may also collect financial information such as credit or debit card number, bank account numbers, and customers’ billing and payment history.

Information related to individuals who are contacted for marketing and promotional purposes is retained until they indicate they no longer wish to be contacted (e.g., unsubscribing from email solicitations).
Information related to individuals will generally be deleted when the purpose for which the information was being used no longer exists.
When do we share personal information?
We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties for purposes unconnected to our uses of the information described above.  However, we may provide personal information to other parties to help us accomplish the uses described above.  Such sharing of information includes:

We provide the third parties with the minimum amount of personal information necessary to fulfill the terms of the predetermined service or transaction, and none of these third parties are permitted to use your personal information except for the purpose of providing a specific service on behalf of Moxtra. Moxtra is responsible for the processing of personal data it receives, under the Privacy Shield Framework, and subsequent transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Moxtra complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU, including the onward transfer liability provisions.
We may also provide information to third parties in connection with legal matters, which includes:
providing information where we are legally obligated to do so (such as subpoenas or court orders), and

Any content provided by a user is solely the responsibility of that user and should not be considered as reflecting the opinion of Moxtra.
Children’s privacy
Moxtra does not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have collected Personal Information on a child under the age of 13, we will delete that data from our systems. Moxtra encourages parents and guardians to go online with their children. Here are a few tips to help make a child’s online experience safer: Teach children never to give Personal Information (such as name, address, phone number, school, etc.) unless supervised by a parent or responsible adult.
