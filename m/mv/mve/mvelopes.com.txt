While this may require that we share some information, we will only share information that the service provider must have to perform the requested services.

Security Safeguards
Mvelopes employs industry-standard physical, electronic and procedural security safeguards to help protect the personally identifiable information that you have provided to us from loss, misuse or unauthorized alteration. Whenever we prompt you to transmit sensitive information, such as a credit card number, we support encryption of your data as it is transmitted.
In2M uses the latest technology to protect your account information from exposure to unauthorized persons. Below are some of the components of this security system:
A username and password are required to access the Mvelopes online service.
After entering a username or password incorrectly three times, access to an account is blocked.
Up to 256-bit encryption scrambles your sensitive transmissions made via the Internet.
You are responsible for protecting the secrecy of your Password in accordance with the terms contained in the Mvelopes Online Service Agreement. We recommend you not store secure pages in your cache or leave your computer unattended while you are logged in to Mvelopes online service or while shopping the In2M Web site.
