Privacy Policy
Privacy Policy
Last Updated: September 12, 2018
The California Film Institute (“CFI” or “we”, “us”, or “our”) has established this privacy policy
(“Privacy Policy”) to let you know the kinds of personal information we may gather when you
visit our Sites, why we gather your information, what we use your personal information for,
when we might disclose your personal information, and how you can manage your personal
information. This Privacy Policy is applicable to CFI’s network of websites, including cafilm.org
and affiliated websites (including any versions optimized for viewing on a wireless or tablet
device); your purchases at a CFI box office or via telephone, any information you submit to us at
a CFI event or to the CFI offices, all email newsletters published or distributed by the CFI; all
apps published on any platform by CFI; information collected through your use of a CFI ticket,
pass, or other CFI issued identification or RSVPs, and all other interactive features, services, and
communications provided by CFI (“Sites”), however accessed and/or used, that are operated by
us, made available by us, or produced and maintained by CFI.
By visiting our Sites, you are accepting the practices described in our Privacy Policy. If you do
not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Sites. We reserve the right to
modify or amend the terms of our Privacy Policy from time to time without notice. Your
continued use of our Sites following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept
those changes. If we intend to apply the modifications or amendments to this Privacy Policy
retroactively or to personal information already in our possession, we will provide you with
notice of the modifications or amendments.
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or don’t see your concerns addressed here,
you should contact us by email at privacy@cafilm.org.
What Information About Me Is Collected and Stored?
We collect two basic types of information from you in conjunction with your use of the Sites,
personal information and non-personal information. Personal information is any information that
can individually identify you and includes, among other things, your name, e-mail address,
telephone number, postal address, credit card, billing and contact information.
Non-personal information includes information that does not personally identify you, but it may
include tracking and usage information about your location, demographics, use of the Sites and
the Internet.
Collection of Personal Information
As a general matter, you can browse the Sites without submitting your personal information to
us. However, there are a number of circumstances in which you may supply us with your
personal information. The following lists the most common ways in which we may collect your
personal information.
•   Registration for an account on or at the Sites
•   Sign up to receive e-mail newsletters or e-mail alerts from us
•   Sign up to receive e-mail offers from CFI or CFI partners
•   Request for customer service or other assistance
•   Participation in surveys, panels, or market research
•   Participation in special events, promotions and programs
•   Purchases on or at the Sites, including tickets or merchandise
•   Entry in contests or sweepstakes
•   Participation on social media accounts involving CFI, our Sites, programs and our brands
•   Participation in communities, comment threads, other forums, and other interactive
services
•   Submission of user generated content on any part of the Sites that permit it
•   Submission of a job application or volunteer application
•   Any other place on or at the Sites where you knowingly volunteer personal information
Tickets and Passes
We issue barcoded tickets and passes to allow us to track attendance at CFI venues. The
information that is collected through barcoded readers is the following:
•   Barcode ID number validating the pass or ticket
•   Screening attendance information (title, date, location, etc.)
Through Social Media Sites
When you interact with any CFI property page or account on a social media platform, such as
Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Tumblr, LinkedIn, YouTube, or Pinterest, we may collect the
personal information that you make available to us on that page or account including your
account ID or “handle.” However, we will comply with the privacy policies of the corresponding
social media platform and we will only collect and store such personal information that we are
permitted to collect by these social media platforms. If you choose to link or login to your CFI
account with or through a social networking service, CFI and that service may share certain
information about you and your activities. With your consent, we also may share information
about your activities, including what you view on the Sites, with that social network’s users.
Non-Personal Information
In addition, when you interact with the Sites, we may collect certain information that does not
identify you individually and our servers may automatically keep an activity log of your use of
our Sites (“Non-Personal Information”). Generally, we collect and store the following categories
of Non-Personal Information:
Demographic data such as age, gender, and five-digit zip code as part of collecting personal
information
•   Device information about your computer, mobile device, or other device that you use to
access the Sites. This information may include IP address, browser type, browser
language, and other transactional information. It does not include device IDs or
geolocation information.
•   Usage information about your use of the Sites. This information includes a reading
history of the pages you view. We use this information to provide you a more customized
experience on the Sites.
•   Additional “traffic data” such as time of access, date of access, software crash reports,
session identification number, access times, and referring website addresses.
•   Your search terms and search results.
•   Other information regarding your use of the Sites.
Source IP Address/Location Information
We collect and store your device’s source IP address and, with your consent, your geolocation
information and device ID which may disclose the location of your device at the time you access
the Sites. In addition, in some cases the Sites can deliver content based on your current location
if you choose to enable that feature. If you enable that feature, your current location will be
stored locally on your device which will be used by the Sites to serve you certain content tied to
your location. If you elect to have your location-based searches saved to your history, we will
store such information on our servers.
Use of Cookies, Flash Cookies and Web Beacons
Like many websites, we use “cookies”, which are small text files that are stored on your
computer or equipment when you visit certain online pages that record your preferences and
actions. We use cookies to track use of our Sites and online services. We may also use cookies to
monitor traffic, improve the Sites and make it easier and/or relevant for your use. You may
occasionally get cookies from companies advertising on our behalf. We do not control these
cookies, and these cookies are not subject to this cookie policy.
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept
cookies, but, if you prefer, you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies. If
you delete your cookies or if you set your web browser to decline cookies, some features of the
Sites may not work or may not work as designed. For more information on cookies and how to
disable them, you can consult the information provided by the Interactive Advertising Bureau at
www.allaboutcookies.org.
Our Sites use Google Analytics (and in the future may use other similar sites or services), a web
analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google"), to better assist CFI in understanding how
the Site is used. Google Analytics will place cookies on your computer that will generate
information that we select about your use of the Site, including your computer's IP address. That
information will be transmitted to and stored by Google. The information will be used for the
purpose of evaluating consumer use of the Site, compiling reports on Site activity for CFI's use,
and providing other services relating to Site activity and usage. Google may also transfer this
information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process
the information on Google's behalf. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the
appropriate settings on your browser. Please note that by doing so, you may not be able to use
the full functionality of the Sites. The use of cookies by Google Analytics is covered by
Google’s Privacy Policy, available at https://policies.google.com/privacy.
Collection of Personal and Non-Personal Information From Other Sources
We also may collect and store information about you that we receive from other sources
(including by us from our offline interactions with you) to, among other things, enable us to
update and correct the information contained in our database and to better customize your
experience on the Sites.
Is Personal Information Collected From Children?
Unless otherwise disclosed during collection and with parent or guardian consent (for instance,
in some of the educational areas on our Sites), CFI does not knowingly collect personal
identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. If you are under 13 years of age
you should not provide personally identifiable information to CFI without providing us with
consent from your parents.
If CFI discovers that a child under the age of 13 has provided CFI with personally identifiable
information and we do not have parental consent, CFI will immediately delete that child’s
information from the Sites. Please contact us at privacy@cafilm.org if you believe we have
collected personally identifiable information from a child.

Third-Party Agents
We have third party agents, subsidiaries, affiliates and partners that perform functions on our

public network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

Also, please note that we have not yet developed a response to browser “Do Not Track” signals,
and do not change any of our data collection practices when we receive such signals. We will
continue to evaluate potential responses to “Do Not Track” signals in light of industry
developments or legal changes.
Your Obligations to Keep Your Access Rights Secure
You promise to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself and
your business as prompted by a Website's registration form (such information being the

inaccurate, not current or incomplete, CFI has the right to suspend or terminate your account and
refuse any and all current or future use of the Sites (or any portion thereof). You are entirely
responsible for the security and confidentiality of your password and account. Furthermore, you

Privacy Policy. In conjunction with your entry in such contest or sweepstakes, Personal
Information will be collected only if you voluntarily submit to it.

private. Please consult the applicable guidelines, if any, for use of our chat rooms and other
community areas for more information.
