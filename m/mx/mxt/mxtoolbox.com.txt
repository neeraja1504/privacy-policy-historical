Cookies: When you use the Service, we may send one or more "cookies" – a small data file – to your computer to uniquely identify your browser and let MxToolbox help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site. A cookie may convey to us information about how you browse the Service, and we may use such information to address targeted advertising such as banner ads (but not spam email messages) to you. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser so that it can be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Service. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser’s directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.
Neither we nor our users tolerate spam. You cannot add other users to your mailing list (email or physical mail) without their express consent. To report spam or spoof emails to us, please forward the email to feedback@mxtoolbox.com. You may not use our communication tools to send spam or otherwise send content that would violate our Agreement. We automatically scan and may manually filter messages to check for spam, viruses, phishing attacks and other malicious activity or illegal or prohibited content, but we do not permanently store messages sent through these tools. If you send an email to an email address that is not registered in our community, we do not permanently store that email or use that email address for any marketing purpose. We do not rent or sell these email addresses.
Log Files: When you use the Service, our servers automatically record certain information sent by your web browser. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, mobile carrier, and other such information.
Clear Gifs Information: When you use the Service, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to track the online usage patterns. The information is used to enable more accurate reporting and make MxToolbox better for our users.
Geo-Location Information: When you use the Service by or through a mobile device, we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store "location data," which may include GPS coordinates (e.g. latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding the location of your mobile device. Location data may convey to us information about how you browse the Service. Though location data does not collect or share any personally identifiable information about you, it may be used in conjunction with personally identifiable information from other sources. Some features of the Service, particularly location-based services, may not function properly if use or availability of location data is impaired or disabled.
Device Identifiers: When you access the Service by or through a mobile device, we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store one or more "device identifiers." Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device and are used to enhance the Service. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent by us to the device. A device identifier may convey to us information about how you use the Service. Though a device identifier does not collect or share any personally identifiable information about you, it may be used in conjunction with personally identifiable information obtained from other sources. A device identifier may remain persistently on your device, to help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Service. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers are impaired or disabled. MxToolbox may access, collect and/or store device identifiers upon enabling MxToolbox’s Services.
Third Party Tools: MxToolbox uses third party analytics tools, such as Google Analytics, to help understand use of the Service. Many of these tools collect the information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, including cookies and your IP address. These analytics tools also receive this information and their use of it is governed by their privacy policy. Similarly, we reference lists and databases compiled and/or maintained by third parties for the monitoring and management of alleged spam and other abusive activities. Please note that MxToolbox does not create, maintain, or in any way control these lists; on the contrary, we simply monitor them so that we can put you on notice when third parties list you or your server on such lists. For more information, please see the Third Parties section of this Privacy Policy.

Such information is stored on secure servers in a controlled environment with limited access.
We use commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information, once we receive it. No method of electronic transmission of storage is 100% secure, however, and we cannot ensure or warrant the absolute security of any information you transmit or store using the Service. Any transmission of Personal Information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained through the Service.
