VelocityEHS to improve its Site(s) and the materials, products and services that we offer on the
Site(s), and to more effectively and efficiently respond to both current and future inquiries.
As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically. This information may
include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP),
referring/exit pages, the files viewed on our site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating
system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data to analyze trends in the aggregate and
administer the site.
Cookies & Similar Technologies
VelocityEHS uses “cookies” (small text files stored on your computer) to help track and
customize your access and use of the Site(s). Cookies store and retain information that helps us
recognize you when you return to the Site(s) following a previous visit. Cookies may also store
any login or ID assigned to you by VelocityEHS and the associated password, though this
information is stored in encrypted form. Most popular Internet browser packages allow you
to configure the browser so as not to accept cookies. However, setting your browser to reject
cookies may prevent you from taking full advantage of our Site(s) and the materials, products
and services that the Company makes available on the Site(s).
To learn more about cookies, visit www.allaboutcookies.org.
VelocityEHS uses analytics software such as Google Analytics, to collect other information.
Generally analytics services do not identify individual users. Many analytics services allow you to
opt out of data collection. For example, to learn more about Google Analytics practices and to
opt out, visit www.google.com/settings/ads or by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out
browser add-on at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout
These analytic services allow us to better understand the functionality of our web sites. This
software may record information such as how often you use the site(s), the events that occur
within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was
downloaded from. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any
personally identifiable information you submit within the application.

Web Beacons
VelocityEHS uses Web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information
about Customers and Visitors’ usage of the Company’s Web sites and interaction with emails
from the Company. Web beacons are clear electronic images that can recognize certain types of
information on your computer, such as cookies, when you viewed a particular Web site or Service
tied to the Web beacon, and a description of a Web site or Service tied to the Web beacon. For
example, we may place Web beacons in marketing emails that notify the Company when you
click on a link in the email that directs you to one of the Company’s Web sites. The Company uses
Web beacons to operate and improve the Company’s Web sites, Services and email
communications.
Social Media Features
The Company’s Web sites may use social media features, such as the Facebook “like” button
(“Social Media Features”). These features may collect your IP address and which page you are
visiting on the Company’s Web site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function
properly. You may be given the option by such Social Media Features to post information about
your activities on the Company’s Web site to a profile page of yours that is provided by a third
party social media network in order to share with others within your network. Social Media
Features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on the Company’s Web site. Your
interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing the
relevant Social Media Features.
Do Not Track
Currently, various browsers — such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari — offer a “do not
track” or “DNT” option that relies on a technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal
to Web sites’ visited by the user about the user's browser DNT preference setting. VelocityEHS
does not currently commit to responding to browsers' DNT signals with respect to the Company's
Web sites, in part, because no common industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry
groups, technology companies or regulators, including no consistent standard of interpreting
user intent. VelocityEHS takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to
continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of
a standard.

submit within the mobile application.

VelocityEHS places a high value on protecting information transmitted via our Site(s). For this

encryption technology to process payments and to provide secure communication methods. In
addition, the Site is protected by a firewall that provides a high level of security. The
Company takes commercially reasonable measures to secure and protect customer-specific
information transmitted via or stored on our Site. However, no security system is impenetrable.
We cannot guarantee that information users supply to us will be totally secure. We may retain
your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you with our
services, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.
Business Transfers

among the transferred business assets.

apply to the privacy practices of those sites. We encourage you to seek out and read the
privacy policy of any Web site that you visit. In addition, when you initiate a transaction on
a Web site that our Site(s) links to, even if you reached that site through our Site(s), the
information that you submit to complete that transaction becomes subject to the privacy
practices of the owner of that linked site. You should read their privacy policies to understand
how they use and protect personal information that they collect. VelocityEHS is not
responsible for the privacy or information practices of its suppliers or any third-party Web
