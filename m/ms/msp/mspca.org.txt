Marketing
The MSPCA-Angell uses remarketing to display ads across the internet, in particular on the Google Display Network and Facebook, based on what parts of our website you have viewed by placing a cookie on your web browser. This cookie does not in any way identify you or give access to your computer or mobile device. This use of remarketing allows us to tailor our messages to only display ads that are relevant to you. If you do not wish to see ads from the MSPCA-Angell, you can opt out by visiting Google’s Ad settings and/or Facebook’s Ad settings.
We may work with social media companies (primarily Facebook) to show you interest-based ads to you or to your friends through Facebook’s Custom Audience Tool. This tool allows us to personalize our ads based on you or your friends’ interactions with MSPCA-Angell. We do not share personal information about you with Facebook, but we share a hashed email address or phone number which allows Facebook to identify our advertising audience based on the information that Facebook collects from its users. If you do not want to receive interest-based ads on Facebook, you can adjust your ad preferences through your Facebook settings.
