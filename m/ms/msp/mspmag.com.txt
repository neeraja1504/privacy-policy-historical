MSP COMMUNICATIONS PRIVACY POLICY
Effective date August 31, 2018
This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, shared and protected when you visit, use or make a purchase from mspmag.com or tcbmag.com, owned by Key Enterprises LLC dba MSP Communications (the “Site”, “We”).
This policy applies where we are acting as a data controller with respect to the personal data of our website visitors, email subscribers, magazine subscribers and event registrants; in other words, where we determine the purposes and means of the processing of that personal data.
If you do not agree to the Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy, you must discontinue using the Site and all services and features therein. By using the Site you acknowledge you have read and understand this Privacy Policy.
PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT
When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your device. Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about the individual web pages or content that you view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and information about how you interact with the Site. We refer to this automatically-collected information as “Device Information.”
When we talk about “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we are talking both about Device Information and Order Information.
DEVICE INFORMATION
In order to serve you in the best capacity possible, we use the Device Information that we collect to help us screen for potential risk and fraud (in particular, your IP address), and more generally to improve and optimize our Site (for example, by generating analytics about how our customers browse and interact with the Site, and to assess the success of our marketing and advertising campaigns).
We collect Device Information using the following technologies:
COOKIES
Cookies are small data files that are placed on your device and often include an anonymous unique identifier. The placement of cookies allows the Site to recognize your device and aids in the collection of browsing information to help us make the ads and content we display more relevant to you. In some cases, you won’t be able to fully take advantage of various features available without accepting cookies to be placed on your device.
Cookies do not typically contain any information that personally identifies a user, but personal information that we store about you may be linked to the information stored in and obtained from cookies.
Our advertising and marketing partners may also use their own cookies; we are not responsible for their activities and policies on the issue.
For more information about cookies, and how to disable cookies, visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org.

ADDITIONAL TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES
Log files track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data including your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps.
Web beacons, tags, and pixels are electronic files used to record information about how you browse the Site.
SOCIAL NETWORKING
You can access various social networks and sharing tools from our Site that are operated by third parties, that allow you to post links to content and features that you believe will be of interest to others on your social network pages. When you visit a page that includes one of these sharing tools, the third-party company that operates the tool may be collecting device information through its own tracking technologies and subject to its own separate privacy policy.
ORDER INFORMATION
When you sign up for a subscription or make a purchase or attempt to make a purchase through the Site, we collect certain personal information from you, including your name, billing address, shipping address, payment information (including credit card numbers), email address, and phone number.

On occasion we will ask for demographic information as it relates to your working persona and the company you work for such as title, gender, age, industry, number of employees and sales revenue. This information will be required if subscribing to business magazines published by MSP Communications.
HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
We use the Order Information that we collect generally for shipping and billing purposes and to fulfill your orders.
Additionally, we may use Device and Order Information for the following purposes:
