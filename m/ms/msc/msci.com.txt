Privacy notice - MSCI
Last modified: January 31, 2019
Protecting the confidentiality and security of personal information is integral to the way in which MSCI Inc. and its affiliates ("MSCI", “us” or “we”) conduct business worldwide.
Generally, MSCI is the controller of any personal information that you provide to us (and for the purposes of EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), this Privacy Notice applies when we act as the controller of personal information).
This Privacy Notice, our Cookie Notice and other legal notices listed on this website (www.msci.com) (together, with all sub-domains and other websites that we own or operate, "Website"), explains our collection, use and disclosure of personal information collected in the course of our business activities.
This Privacy Notice does not apply to information collected, stored, shared, or distributed by third-party sites. This Privacy Notice does not apply to our employees, who are covered by our internal notices, policies and procedures.
Please read this Privacy Notice carefully. The summary immediately below describes only highlights, and we encourage you to read this Privacy Notice completely. By visiting our Website you acknowledge the practices described in this Privacy Notice.
Summary
MSCI is a multinational corporation, with offices around the world. MSCI’s clients and prospects are companies, not individuals or consumers. MSCI’s vendors, service providers and consultants (together, “Vendors” ) are typically companies but on occasion may be individuals.
We process personal data that comes from three sources: information you provide, information we receive from other sources, and information collected automatically.
The first category, information you provide, includes information that you provide through our Website, through our products or through our client support portals, through day-to-day interaction with us, in connection with a job search, and as a visitor to our offices. The second category, information we receive from other sources, includes information from public sources, information from our employees, and information from our clients. The last category, information we collect automatically, includes information collected when you visit our Website or use our IT systems/networks.
Where required by applicable data protection law, including the GDPR, our processing of your personal information will be justified on a lawful basis. We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties. We share data internally among our corporate affiliates and business units in the ordinary course of our daily operations. We share personal information with our Vendors in connection with their performance of services for us, in accordance with our instructions, and subject to appropriate contractual restrictions and security and confidentiality obligations. We may be required to disclose your personal information for legal/regulatory/compliance purposes or in connection with an investigation, or if we believe it is reasonably necessary to prevent harm or loss. We may also share your personal information in connection with certain corporate events.
MSCI maintains physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that aim to protect personal information against loss, misuse, damage or modification and unauthorized access or disclosure. Highlights of MSCI’s information security program can be found on our Website athttps://www.msci.com/information-security. If your personal information is transferred outside the EU/EEA/UK to other MSCI group companies or to Vendors, we will take steps to ensure that your personal information receives the same level of protection as if it remained within the EU/EEA/UK.
We send our marketing emails within the US on an opt-out basis, in accordance with the US CAN-SPAM legislation. Outside of the US, we rely on opt-in consent. We offer multiple ways to manage your email subscriptions, including an online preference center, unsubscribe mechanisms, and direct client support.
If you are a resident of the EU, EEA or UK, you have the following rights under the GDPR (collectively, “GDPR Rights”): right of access / subject access request, right of rectification, right to erasure (the “right to be forgotten”), right to restriction processing, right to data portability, right to object to processing (including profiling) based on legitimate interests and direct marketing (including profiling), and rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling. If you wish to exercise any of your GDPR Rights, please submit your request to us by completing the web form available athttps://www.msci.com/gdpr-external-form. In addition, under GDPR, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority of your habitual residence, place of work or place of any alleged infringement (if you consider that the processing of your personal information infringes the GDPR).

Such relationships may include employees and other personnel of our clients and prospects, directors, vendors, consultants and other professional advisors.

For example, Vendors who are individuals may also provide payment details and professional qualifications.

We also collect information that you provide to us at job fairs and during the interview process. Finally, we may require a background check as a condition of employment, where required or permitted by the applicable law of your jurisdiction. Background checks may include credit reports and criminal records, and references in relation to recruitment for specific roles.
Information we receive from other sources
Information from public sources: We collect information from the public domain about individuals who work at companies with whom we are seeking to build a business relationship, for purposes of generating leads.

As part of our recruitment process, we collect information from the public domain that individuals post on professional networking sites and job boards (e.g., LinkedIn).
Additionally, as part of the production of our ESG products, we collect and publish information from the public domain (e.g., public filings, websites, press releases, etc.), which may include information about the officers, directors and other senior managers of corporations that are the subject of our ESG ratings and reports. As part of our standard process, we ask the respective companies to forward the link to this Privacy Notice on to those officers and directors.
In relation to the calculation and maintenance of our equity indexes, we collect and use information from public sources about company shareholding and ownership.
Information from our employees: In furtherance of our employment relationship with our employees, our employee benefit plans and our legal, regulatory and compliance requirements, employees may provide personal information about their spouses / domestic partners, emergency contacts, dependents and other family members.

If you attend our events, we may share your name in our participant list / brochure, and we may include photographs / videos taken of you at the event on our website and in our marketing materials.
We may be required to disclose your personal information to comply with any applicable legal or regulatory requirements, or where we believe that the disclosure will further an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activities; to enforce our legal rights; or if we believe it is reasonably necessary to prevent harm or loss.
We may share your personal information with third parties in connection with potential or actual sale of our company or any of our assets, or those of any affiliated company, including through mergers and acquisitions, changes of control or divestitures, or connection with bankruptcy or insolvency, in which case personal information held by us about our users may be one of the transferred assets. Where appropriate, we will take reasonable measures to require the recipient of your personal information to treat it in accordance with this Privacy Notice. MSCI reserves the right to share any information that you provide which is not deemed personal information or is not otherwise subject to contractual restrictions.
Data transfers outside of the EU/EEA/UK
If your personal information is transferred outside the EU/EEA/UK to other MSCI group companies or to Vendors, we will take steps to ensure that your personal information receives the same level of protection as if it remained within the EU/EEA/UK, including by entering into data transfer agreements, using the European Commission approved Standard Contractual Clauses, or by relying on certification schemes such as the EU - US Privacy Shield or other then-currently valid mechanisms for transfers. For transfers to MSCI in the US, a country that does not benefit from an adequacy decision by the European Commission, and for other transfers within the MSCI group, we have put in place European Commission approved Standard Contractual Clauses, which protect personal information transferred between MSCI entities.

MSCI maintains physical, technical and organizational safeguards designed to protect personal information against unauthorized disclosure or access, and accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration. Highlights of MSCI’s information security program can be found on our Website at https://www.msci.com/information-security.
While MSCI aims to safeguard and protect your personal information from unauthorized access, improper use or disclosure, unauthorized modification or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, and MSCI utilizes and maintains certain reasonable processes, systems, and technologies to do so, you acknowledge that no transmission over the Internet is completely secure or error-free, and that these processes, systems, and technologies utilized and maintained by MSCI may be subject to compromise. Accordingly, we cannot be held responsible for unauthorized or unintended access that is beyond our control.
Retention of your personal information
While we generally aim to retain your personal information for the period during which we have a relationship with you, there are many reasons why we may need to retain your data for longer. For example, we may need to retain your personal data if the purpose for which we collected it extends beyond the term of our relationship. We may also retain your personal information for a term that corresponds to a statute of limitations, to establish, exercise or defend legal claims, or as otherwise permitted or required by law, so that in each case we have an accurate record of your dealings with us in the event of any complaints or challenges. We may also retain your personal information for compliance or regulatory purposes, where we are required to do so in accordance with legal, regulatory, tax and/or accounting requirements, or to support a legal or regulatory process, audits, or requests or requirements of a legal or regulatory authority or other governmental entity having authority to make the request.

Right of Access / Subject Access Request: You are entitled to request confirmation that your personal information is being processed; access to your personal information; and other supplementary information that may not be included in this Privacy Notice.
Right of Rectification: You are entitled to have any inadequate, incomplete or incorrect personal information corrected.
Right to Erasure (the “right to be forgotten”): You are entitled to have your personal information erased under specific circumstances, such as where you have withdrawn your consent, where you object to processing based on legitimate interests and we have no overriding legitimate grounds, or where personal information is unlawfully processed.
Right to Restriction Processing: You have the right to restrict our processing of your personal information (that is, allow only its storage) where:
you contest the accuracy of the personal information, until we have taken sufficient steps to correct or verify its accuracy;
where the processing is unlawful but you do not want us to erase the personal information;
where we no longer need your personal information for the purposes of the processing, but you require such personal information for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; or
where you have objected to processing justified on legitimate interest grounds (see below), pending verification as to whether we have compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing.
Where your personal information is subject to restriction we will only process it with your consent, for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims, for the protection of the rights of another person, or for reasons of important public interest.
Right to Data Portability: Where we are relying (as the legal basis for processing) upon your consent, or the fact that the processing is necessary to perform a contract to which you are party or to take steps at your request prior to entering a contract, and the personal information is processed by automatic means, you have the right to receive all such personal information which you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, and also to require us to transmit it to another controller where this is technically feasible.
Right to Object: You have the right to object to:
Processing (including profiling) based on legitimate interest grounds : Where we are relying upon legitimate interests to process personal information, you have the right to object to that processing. If you object, we must stop that processing unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override your interests, rights and freedoms, or we need to process the personal information for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. Where we rely upon legitimate interests as a basis for processing we believe that we can demonstrate such compelling legitimate grounds, but we will consider each case on an individual basis.
Direct marketing (including profiling) : You have the right to object to our use of your personal information (including profiling) for direct marketing purposes, such as when we use your personal information to invite you to our promotional events.
Rights in Relation to Automated Decision Making and Profiling: You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affects you. Please note, we do not use your personal information for automated decision making, including profiling.
You have a right to obtain details of the mechanism under which your personal information is transferred outside of the EU/EEA/UK by completing the web form available at https://www.msci.com/gdpr-external-form.
You have the right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority of your habitual residence, place of work or place of alleged infringement, if you consider that the processing of your personal information infringes applicable law.
