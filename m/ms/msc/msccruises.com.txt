All data provided will be processed in an automatic, computerised and/or manual manner, for the time required to achieve the purposes for which they were collected.

Data security
In order to avoid the loss of data, unlawful or incorrect usage of same and unauthorised access, MSC regularly checks and updates its physical, electronic and logical security measures.

Therefore, data is transmitted at your own risk, on the understanding that, once transmission is complete, MSC accepts all responsibility as regards security. The site might contain links to other internet sites deemed useful for users or relating to third party advertising. These resources might operate under the control of third parties, adopting different privacy policies. Therefore, MSC asks that you check the privacy policies of said third parties, as MSC has no control over any information provided by them.
