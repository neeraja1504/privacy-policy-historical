What is the Minnesota.gov Portal
MN.IT Services is the developer and manager of The Minnesota.gov portal. Minnesota.gov is the electronic entry point to Minnesota State government information and services. It is the gateway for providing direct government-to-citizen public service provision and interaction through the use of information technology. The Minnesota.gov portal is dedicated to protecting your privacy on-line. The following privacy statement outlines how individual information will be handled by Minnesota.gov while using our services.
Protection of individual privacy is a primary concern, and is governed by Minnesota Statutes Chapter 13, GOVERNMENT DATA PRACTICES. Minnesota.gov has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this site; http://mn.gov/ .

For site management functions, information is collected for analysis and statistical purposes. This information is not reported or used in any manner that would reveal personally identifiable information, and will not be released to any outside parties unless legally required to do so in connection with law enforcement investigations or other legal proceedings.
We use Log analysis tools to create summary statistics, which are used for purposes such as assessing what information is of most interest, determining technical design specifications, and identifying system performance or problem areas. Our website logs do not collect personally identifiable information, and we make no attempt to link them with the individuals who browse the Minnesota.gov portal. When you visit the Minnesota.gov portal and browse or download information, we automatically collect and store the following information about your visit:
The Internet Protocol Address and domain name used but not the email address. The Internet Protocol address is a numerical identifier assigned either to your Internet service provider or directly to your computer. We use the Internet Protocol Address to direct Internet traffic to you;
The type of browser and operating system you used;
The date and time you visited this site;

If during your visit to the Minnesota.gov portal you participate in a survey, fill out a web form, or send an email, the following additional information will be collected:
The email address and contents of the email; and
Information volunteered to complete a web form or in response to a survey.
The information collected is not limited to text characters and may include audio, video, and graphic information formats you send us.

We may redirect your message to another government agency that is in a better position to answer your question. Survey information is used for the purpose designated.
Personal Information and Choice
Personal information is information about a natural person that is readily identifiable to that specific individual. Personal information includes such things as an individual's name, address, and phone number. A domain name or Internet Protocol address is not considered personal information.
We collect no personal information about you unless you voluntarily participate in an activity that asks for information (i.e. sending an email, filling out a web form, or participating in a survey). If you choose not to participate in these activities, your choice will in no way affect your ability to use any other feature of the Minnesota.gov portal.
If personal information is requested on the website or volunteered by the user, State law and the federal Privacy Act of 1974 may protect it. However, this information is a public record once you provide it, and may be subject to public inspection and copying if not protected by Federal or State law.
Users are cautioned that the collection of personal information requested from or volunteered by children on-line or by email will be treated the same as information given by an adult, and may be subject to public access.
Public Disclosure
