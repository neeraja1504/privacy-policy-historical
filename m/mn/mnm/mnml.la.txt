Buyer is Importer of Record
The goods will be imported on behalf of the consignee/buyer. The consignee authorizes mnml to import the goods on his behalf. Further, the consignee/buyer agrees mnml may delegate the obligation to import the goods on his behalf to a subcontractor (e.g. customs broker). The consignee will pay the taxes & duties in addition with the purchase price of the goods.
RETURNS // REFUNDS // EXCHANGES
We want you to be 100% satisfied with your purchase from mnml.  If for any reason you are not satisfied, we would be happy to issue a store credit for any returned merchandise. Returns/Exchanges are NOT accepted for sales items.
Returns must be postmarked and mailed within 30 days from receipt of merchandise. Merchandise must be unworn with the original tags attached and in original packaging (where applicable).
International returns initiated due to refusal to pay duties and taxes will be subject to a $25 restocking fee which will be deducted from the refund amount.
Please include the original packing list with your return to avoid any delays in processing. Once the package is received, our warehouse will process the return, and you will be notified via email.
We reserve the right to correct, update or change our returns/refund/exchange policy at any time without notification.
Please visit mnml.loopreturns.com to process a return. All returns and exchanges should be shipped via insured traceable mail in a secure package to the following address:

LINKS TO THIRD PARTIES
For your convenience and to improve the usage of the website, we insert links to third parties, for which this Privacy Policy does not apply. These links take you outside our services and off the mnml.la website and are beyond our control. This includes links from parties that may use mnml logos as part of a co-branding agreement or sell mnml’s products. The sites you can link to have their own separate Privacy Policy and although we seek to protect the integrity of our site, mnml is not responsible and cannot be held liable for the content and activities of these sites. Your visit/access to these sites therefore is entirely at your own risk. Please note that these other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data or solicit personal information.
By using our website, you (the visitor) agree to allow third parties to process your IP address, in order to determine your location for the purpose of currency conversion. You also agree to have that currency stored in a session cookie in your browser (a temporary cookie which gets automatically removed when you close your browser). We do this in order for the selected currency to remain selected and consistent when browsing our website so that the prices can convert to your (the visitor) local currency.
