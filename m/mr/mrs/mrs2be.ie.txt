Security
We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. In order to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure we have put in place suitable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.
Passwords
Your password is ciphered (a one-way hash) so that it is secure and so that we cannot tell what it is. However, it is recommended that you do not reuse the same password across a number of different websites. Your password is the means of accessing your account, so please guard it carefully and under no circumstances will anyone affiliated with us or any third party legitimately ask you for your password. Should you forget your password for your account, you can use the I forgot my password feature provided by the software. This process will ask you to submit your user name and your email, and then the software will generate a new password to reclaim your account and email it to you.

Unless you choose otherwise, we will use only temporary session cookies (which are deleted at the end of each session on the site) and not persistent cookies.
