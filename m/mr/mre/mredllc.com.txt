You, our Members, should be aware of the issues surrounding privacy and information security with regard to your client's information and that they may have an impact on your business practices.
Please read this Privacy Policy to learn more. This Policy applies to the use of this site by our Members. Since technology has become such an integral part of our business in the last few years and has really changed many aspects of the real estate transaction, we are proud to offer up-to-date services to our Members through this website.

INFORMATION COLLECTED ON THIS WEBSITE:
Automatic Collection of Anonymous Information. When you enter the MREDLLC.com website, like when you visit most other websites, certain anonymous information about your visit is automatically logged. This may include information about the type of browser you use, the server name and IP (Internet Protocol) address through which you access the Internet, the date and time you access the site, the pages you access or, if you linked to the website from another, the Internet address of that website may be captured and logged. None of this information is personally identifiable. You are traveling the website anonymously until you access the MRED Members Only (Secure Access Only) portion of the website. When you Log In with your Member ID# and your Password, you must allow us to set a "Cookie" (see "Cookies" below) in order to verify that your Member ID# and Password match and that you are an authorized user of the Member services available. At that point we know it is you, or it should be you, and no other, as sharing your Member ID# and Password access information is a violation of the terms of our Agreement for use of the Multiple Listing Services. At that point we have personally identifiable information based on our records about you.
Personally Identifiable Information
Personally identifiable information is any information that concerns you, individually, and would permit someone to contact you, for example, your name, address, telephone number, social security number, email address or any information you submit that identifies you individually.
Cookies
The MRED website's server, or the servers of companies that are used to operate this site, may place a "Cookie" on your computer in order to allow you to use the website and, in a Member's case, to allow you access to the various systems and services behind our "Members Only" wall. A "Cookie" is a small piece of data that is sent by a web server to your computer, which then may be stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Cookies allow us to recognize your computer while you are on our website. Cookies are useful in allowing us to track where you go on our site. It helps us improve the functionality of our website by knowing what our Members use and do not use. Most web browser applications (such as Microsoft Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator) have features that can notify you when you receive a cookie or prevent cookies from being sent but, as said above, you do need to allow cookies to enter the Members Only portion of the website.
EXTERNAL LINKS
The MRED.com website contains links to other websites, RealtorÂ® Associations and MRED Marketing Partners just to name a few. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices, information security or business practices of other websites. Websites that are accessible by links from our website may use Cookies (see "Cookies" above). We encourage you to read the privacy statements provided by other websites before you provide personally identifiable information to them.
SECURITY
