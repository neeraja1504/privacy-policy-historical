The Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA) (the General Data Protection Regulation GDPR from May 2018) protects the rights of individuals by setting out certain rules as to what organisations can and cannot do with information about people. A key element to this is the principle to process individuals’ data lawfully and fairly. In order to meet the fairness part of this we need to provide information on how we process personal data.
The University takes its obligations under the Data Protection Act very seriously and will always ensure personal data is collected, handled, stored and shared in a secure manner.
The following statement will outline what personal data we collect, how we use it and who we share it with. It will also provide guidance on your individual rights and how to make a complaint to the Information Commissioner’s Office, the regulator for data protection in the UK.

How and why does the University use personal data?
The largest volume of personal data the University processes is in relation to students, at both undergraduate and postgraduate level. The primary purposes we process information about these individuals include:
to enable us to administer student-related functions from original applications through to graduation and to provide alumni services;
to plan and account for the use of the services provided;
to produce information including statistics for relevant external agencies such as the Higher Education Statistical Agency (HESA) and the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) which allocates funds to the University on the basis of student numbers;
to enable University staff to communicate with students;
to monitor academic progress over the period of enrolment towards completion of a qualification;
to carry out assessment, authorise award of qualifications and verification of awarded qualifications post-study;
to monitor, complaints, disciplinary cases and academic appeals;
to provide student support services, including financial, pastoral and IT/learning resources;
to comply with immigration compliance checks in relation to sponsored migrants;
to ensure all eligible students have access to University accommodation;
to monitor, develop and update University systems to ensure they continue to operate effectively and securely; and
to monitor equality and diversity objectives within the University.
The University also processes personal data in relation to staff, both academic and non-teaching. This is undertaken to facilitate recruitment activity and to administer the requirements the University must meet as an employer in line with UK law. In addition, it is used to facilitate operational activity within the relevant faculty / professional service.
Finally, the University processes personal data as part of research activity. This is done in line with the University's Code of Practice for Research, which includes meeting the requirements of current data protection legislation.

in order to meet pension obligations.
Your rights
An individual has the right to ask the University what personal data we hold about them, and to ask for a copy of that information. This is called making a Data Protection Subject Access Request.
A Subject Access Request should be submitted in writing via email to the Data Protection Officer or in hard copy to the postal address provided above. The University reserves the right to ask you to provide proof of identification and for you to clarify your request if it is unclear in the first instance. You will receive a reply no longer than 40 calendar days from the date you make the request in writing.
If you are unhappy with the initial response you can ask the University to undertake a further search if there is specific information you have good reason to believe exists but that hasn’t been provided.
You also have the right to complain to the UK Regulator the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO’s) if you believe you request has not been dealt with properly or you have a complaint to raise against the University for any other data protection related issue. A complaint can be raised via the ICO’s website or write to the following address:
