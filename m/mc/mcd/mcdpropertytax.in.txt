Introduction
We, at "Municipal Corporation of Delhi" hereinafter referred as M.C.D and our affiliated Organizations, are committed to respecting your online privacy and recognize your need for appropriate protection and management of any personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") you share with us.

In general, you can visit M.C.D's Web pages without telling us who you are or revealing any Personal Information about yourself.
