Personally Identifiable Information
You can visit and enjoy the Web Site without disclosing any Personally Identifiable Information about yourself.However, in the course of using the Web Site and the Services, it may be necessary for you to, or you may choose to, provide us with certain Personally Identifiable Information."Personally Identifiable Information" includes, for example, your name, street address, e-mail address, phone number, mobile phone number, short message service (SMS) or text message address, date of birth, credit card and other payment information, and/or other information that may identify you as an individual or allow online or offline contact with you as an individual.We also may, from time to time, receive Personally Identifiable Information about you from third party sources to improve the Web Site and our Services, and for the various purposes outlined herein.
Personally Identifiable Information may be collected on or through the Web Site or Services in a variety of ways and in a variety of circumstances, including, for example:
when you register on the Web Site;
when you participate in contests, sweepstakes, promotions, surveys or voting;
when you participate in games;

Web Site Usage Information
Cookies.To help us serve you better, we collect information that alone does not identify you personally, but rather identifies your computer or browser. This is done by using small files called "cookies" and by tracking internet protocol (IP) addresses. A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier that is sent to your browser from a Web site's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive so that we can recognize you when you return. Cookies operate in the background, and you can turn them off if you wish by adjusting your Web browser settings, but doing so may impair your ability to use some of the features on the Web Site. We may use cookies to make the Web Site work better by, for example, remembering your preferences, keeping track of your login name, password and, if you want to buy things while on the Web Site, your "shopping cart."
Other Tracking Technologies.We also may use Web beacons and other similar tracking technologies (such as "clear GIFs," "Web beacons" and "pixel tags") in the Web Site, the Services and/or in our communications with you to enable us to know whether you have visited a Web page or received a message.Such technologies are typically a one-pixel, transparent image (although it can be a visible image as well), located on a Web page or in an e-mail or other type of message, enabling the verification of an individual’s viewing or receipt of a Web page or message.
IP Addresses. Our servers collect the IP addresses of computers that visit the Web Site, which we may use to analyze trends, help administer the Web Site, track the movement of visitors and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.IP addresses are not linked to any Personally Identifiable Information, except as may be necessary to verify users’ locations for various purposes, such as to identify problematic accounts, and to determine the applicability of blackout restrictions for certain audio/video subscription products, as applicable.
Clickstream Data. Our servers also collect clickstream data, which includes a trail of electronic information left at each web site and web page you visit, such as the referring page that linked you to us (e.g., another Web site or a search engine); the pages you visit on this Web Site; the Web site you visit after this Web Site; other information about the type of Web browser, computer, platform, related software and settings you are using; any search terms you have entered on this Web Site or a referral site; and other Web usage activity and data logged by our Web servers.We may use this information to learn about and determine how much time visitors spend on each page of the Web Site or the Service, how visitors navigate throughout the Web Site or the Service and how we may tailor our web pages to better meet the needs of visitors.
Any or all of the above-described activities with respect to non-personally identifiable information may be performed on our behalf by our authorized Service Providers, agents or representatives.Except for IP Addresses (as described above), we may match information that does not alone identify you as an individual with other information we may have from or about you, including your Personally Identifiable Information.
HOW WE MAY USE YOUR INFORMATION
In addition to other uses described in this Privacy Policy, the information we collect on or through the Web Site or Services, including both Personally Identifiable Information and non-personally identifiable information, may be used by us (and by our Services Providers, on our behalf) for a variety of purposes, including to:

(ii)provide you with Services or information you have requested, or products or services you have ordered or signed up for, such as newsletters;

Users may be able to send information about our Member Clubs, our products, our Services and/or our Web Site to their friends and family members by using an "E-mail to Friend" or similar feature on the Web Site or in an e-mail that we have sent them.In some of these cases (unless a user simply forwards our e-mail on his or her own), the user may provide the name and e-mail address of his or her friend or family member to us.We do not use the names or e-mail addresses submitted in these circumstances for any other purpose without the consent of the e-mail recipient to do so.

These companies may collect information about your visits to the Web Site in order to measure and assess the effectiveness of online advertising and to provide and better target advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. While the information collected by these third parties from you while you are visiting our Web Site is not personally identifiable, some of these third parties may also combine such non-personally identifiable information with other information they have collected from various other sources, such as their own past online and/or offline purchase information and Web usage from other sites.Such other information may include Personally Identifiable Information, as well as demographic and behavioral information. Those companies’ use of cookies, and the information collected therethrough, will be covered by their own privacy policies, not ours.

SHORT MESSAGE SERVICE

SECURITY PRACTICES
The security of your Personally Identifiable Information is important to us.Your preferences are password protected for your privacy and security, and we employ industry-standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology in an effort to protect data transmissions.However, due to the inherent open nature of the Internet we cannot guarantee that communications between you and any Web Site or Service, or information stored on any Web Site or our servers, will be free from unauthorized access by third parties such as hackers.We strongly recommend that you do not disclose your password to anyone.
If you contact us by e-mail, via a messaging feature, or by a "contact us" or similar feature on the Web Site, you should be aware that your transmission might not be secure.A third party could view information you send by these methods in transit.We will have no liability for disclosure of your information due to errors or unauthorized acts of third parties during or after transmission.
In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of any user’s Personally Identifiable Information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify such user of that development.If a notification is appropriate, we would endeavor to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and, to the extent we have your e-mail address, we may notify you by e-mail.You consent to our use of e-mail as the means of such notification.However, if you do not want to be notified by e-mail for this purpose, please contact us at privacy@mlssoccer.com.

When you link to such other sites and services (including by means of clicking on hyperlinks, logos, widgets, banners or advertisements), you become subject to their terms of use and privacy policies posted thereon and/or applicable thereto. For example, these other websites may send their own cookies to you, independently collect data or solicit Personally Identifiable Information directly from you on their sites.

CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY
You should review this Privacy Policy periodically as we may modify it from time to time, and such changes will be effective upon our posting them to the Web Site. Where consistent with applicable law, your continued use of the Web Site and/or the Services after we have changed the Privacy Policy signifies your acceptance of the revised terms.Under certain circumstances (e.g., with respect to certain material changes to this Privacy Policy), we may also elect to notify you through additional means, such as posting a notice on the front page of the Web Site or by means of an e-mail that gives you the opportunity to indicate whether you consent to the proposed change.
SPECIAL RULES FOR CHILDREN
General Rules. Most portions of the Web Site are directed to general audiences, and we do not knowingly collect information from children under 13 in such areas.At those general audience portions, if we request a date of birth that includes a birth year, we screen out children under 13 and do not collect information from them.The Web Site, however, may include one or more portions that are directed to children under 13, and the statements in this Privacy Policy generally about our collection and use of non-personally identifiable information also apply to any such areas, with the added protection of the special rules that follow with respect to Personally Identifiable Information.
Information Collected and Parental Rights.If your child wants to register on or participate in certain activities in the areas of the Web Site that are directed to children under 13, and such participation requires that we collect Personally Identifiable Information from your child, we will collect from your child your and your child’s name and/or e-mail address in order to obtain your consent.We will then send you an e-mail (which will include a link to this Privacy Policy), advising you about the portion of the Web Site in which your child has expressed interest, and request that you reply by e-mail if you consent to your child’s participation.In the reply e-mail, we may request further Personally Identifiable Information from you (as defined in the main part of this Privacy Policy) about you and/or your child, but we will not request such information from your child.We will then send you a confirmatory e-mail of your child’s registration.Once your children are registered, we may request them to provide general information such as their favorite player.You have the right to review your child’s Personally Identifiable Information, to have that information deleted, and/or to refuse to permit its further collection or use.Parents can contact the Privacy Administrator at the address or email asset forth at the end of this policy and we will respond to their requests.
Information Use and Disclosure.We – and any of our Member Club(s) the child indicates interest in – may use the Personally Identifiable Information to provide the child with the special services for which he or she has registered, such as membership in a Kids Club, receipt of newsletters, or participation in contests.We do not condition a child's participation in any of our online activities on the disclosure of more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity.
Currently, the portions of our Web Site that are directed to children under 13 do not have unscreened chat rooms, blogs or other similar community functionality that would permit your child to disclose information to others or publicly.In addition, any "postcard" or "share with a friend" feature that may be available on these portions of our Web Site will collect the recipient’s e-mail address, but not the sender’s; permit the sender to type in a first name and last initial; supply the content or allow the sender to select a pre-determined message from a menu; and be sent immediately, at which time the recipient’s e-mail address as collected from the sender is deleted from our records.
Personally Identifiable Information collected on or through any portions of our Web Site that are directed to children under 13 may be shared with Service Providers (as defined above) with whom we contract to operate this Web Site and some of our Services. These Service Providers will use such Personally Identifiable Information of Web Site visitors only for the purposes of carrying out these operations. To the extent required or permitted by law, we may also collect, use and disclose such Personal Identifiable Information in connection with security-related or law enforcement investigations or in the course of cooperating with authorities or complying with legal requirements. We may also use Web Site users’ information as permitted by law to protect our rights or property, our website, or its users and their safety.As set forth above, we endeavor to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the Personally Identifiable Information collected from your child.Other than our Service Providers and as described above, we will not share your child’s Personally Identifiable Information with third parties.
