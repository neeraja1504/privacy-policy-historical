Privacy Policy, effective as of December 6, 2019.
MLSListings Inc. (“MLSListings”) operates a multiple listing service. As part of the services offered to our participants and subscribers, we have created and maintain this public website.
The privacy of your personal information is very important to us. We have created this Privacy Policy to inform you of what information is collected, used, maintained, protected, and disclosed. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that MLSListings does not own or control, or to people whom MLSListings does not employ or manage.
MLSListings collects personal information only as allowed by law. We limit the collection of personal information to what is relevant and necessary to accomplish a lawful purpose. We do not sell, share or rent this information other than as disclosed in this policy.

By accessing or using the Site, you agree to this Privacy Policy. This policy may change from time to time (see Changes to this Privacy Policy). Your continued use of this Site after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes, so please check the policy periodically for updates.

Links
The Site may contain links to other websites. MLSListings does not endorse any third party websites and is not responsible for the content or privacy practices of those websites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our Site, and to read the privacy statements of websites that collect personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Site.
Cookies
A cookie is software code stored on a user’s hard drive while on our Site. It is not linked to any personally identifiable information, and once the user closes his or her browser, the cookie terminates. If your browser is set to reject cookies, you may still use our Site; however, you will be limited in some areas. For example, you will not be able to complete a property search because our Site uses cookies to “remember” search criteria while you are on the Site.
Servers for our Site automatically receive and record some information into a log. For this Site this includes identifying your browser, this Site cookie information, IP address and the pages you request. We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the Site, and gather broad demographic information for use in improving Site performance. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.
Do Not Track
Currently, various browsers — including Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Firefox, and Safari — offer a “do not track” or “DNT” option that relies on a technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to Web sites’ visited by the user about the user's browser DNT preference setting. MLSListings does not currently commit to responding to browsers' DNT signals with respect to the Site, in part, because no common industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies or regulators, including no consistent standard of interpreting user intent. MLSListings takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard.
Use of Google Analytics
We use Google Analytics, a web analysis service provided by Google, which allows us to understand the overall use of our Site and services. Google Analytics collects information such as how frequently users visit the Site, how many users visit the Site, and what pages they visit. Google Analytics provides us this data in aggregated form.
Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics is dictated by the Google Analytics Terms of Service and the Google Privacy Policy. You may opt-out of Google Analytics by installing Google’s opt-out browser add-on here.
Surveys & Contests
From time-to-time our Site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation is completely voluntary and you have a choice whether or not to disclose requested information. Contact information will be used to notify winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this Site.
Changes to this Privacy Policy
MLSListings reserves the right to change this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of the Site following the posting of changes to this policy will mean you accept those changes. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will post the updated Privacy Policy here and may notify you by email or by means of a notice on our Site.
Security Statement
MLSListings maintains reasonable and appropriate measures to protect the personal information obtained through the Site and in connection with our services from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.
