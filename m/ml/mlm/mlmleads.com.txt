MLMLeads.com Mobile Marketing Privacy Policy
What information do we collect? We collect information in two ways:
When you give it to us or give us permission to obtain it. When you sign up for or use our products, you voluntarily give us certain information. This can include your name, profile photo, social posts, comments, likes, email address you used to sign up, and any other information you provide us. If youï¿½re using MLMLeads on your mobile device, you can also choose to provide us with location data. You also may give us permission to access your information in other services. For example, you may link your Facebook or Twitter account to MLMLeads, which allows us to obtain information from those accounts (e.g., your friends or contacts). The information we obtain from those services often depends on your settings or their privacy policies, so be sure to check what those are.
We also get technical information when you use our products or use websites or apps that have MLMLeads features. These days, whenever you use a website, mobile application, or other Internet service, thereï¿½s certain information that almost always gets created and recorded automatically. The same is true when you use our products. Here are some of the types of information we collect:
ï¿½ Log Data. When you use MLMLeads or go to a webpage or use an app that has MLMLeads features, our servers automatically record information (ï¿½log dataï¿½) including information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website or your mobile app sends when youï¿½re using it. This log data may include your Internet Protocol address, the address of the web pages you visited that had MLMLeads features, browser type and settings, the date and time of your request, how you used MLMLeads, and cookie data.
ï¿½ Cookie data. Depending on how youï¿½re accessing our products, we may use ï¿½cookiesï¿½ (a small text file sent by your computer each time you visit our website, unique to your MLMLeads account or your browser), or similar technologies to record log data. When we use cookies, we may use ï¿½sessionï¿½ cookies (that last until you close your browser) or ï¿½persistentï¿½ cookies (that last until you or your browser delete them). For example, we may use cookies to store your language preferences or other MLMLeads settings so you donï¿½t have to set them up every time you visit MLMLeads. Some of the cookies we use are associated with your MLMLeads account (including personal information about you, such as the email address you gave us), and other cookies are not.
ï¿½ Device Information. In addition to log data, we may also collect information about the device youï¿½re using MLMLeads on, including what type of device it is, what operating system youï¿½re using, device settings, unique device identifiers, and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device youï¿½re using and its settings. For example, different types of information are available depending on whether youï¿½re using a Mac or a PC, or an iPhone or an Android phone. To learn more about what information your device makes available to us, please also check the policies of your device manufacturer or software provider.
How do we use the information we collect?

* Help your friends and contacts find you. For example, if you sign up using a Facebook account, we may help your Facebook friends find your account on MLMLeads.
* Respond to your questions or comments.
The information we collect may be ï¿½personally identifiableï¿½ (meaning it can be used to specifically identify you as a unique person) or ï¿½non-personally identifiableï¿½ (meaning it canï¿½t be used to specifically identify you). We use both types of information, and combinations of both types, as described above. We may use or store information wherever MLMLeads does business, including countries outside your own.
* What choices do you have about your information?
Our goal is to give you simple and meaningful choices over your information. If you have a MLMLeads account, many of the choices you have on MLMLeads are built directly in to the product or your account settings. For example, you can:
* Access and change information in your social profiles at any time, choose whether your profile page is available to search engines;
* Link or unlink your MLMLeads account from an account on another service (e.g., Facebook or Twitter). For some services (like Facebook), you can also choose whether or not to publish your activity to that service.
* Close your account at any time. When you close your account, weï¿½ll deactivate it and remove your content from MLMLeads. We may retain archived copies of your information as required by law or for legitimate business purposes (including to help address fraud and spam).

For example, you can choose to publish your content to Facebook or Twitter.
* We may employ third party companies or individuals to process personal information on our behalf based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy. For example, we may share data with a security consultant to help us get better at identifying spam or with our accountants to make sure weï¿½re keeping the books right. In addition, some of the information we request may be collected by third party providers on our behalf.
* If we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety, rights, or property of the public, any person, or MLMLeads; or to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.
* We may engage in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, or similar transaction or proceeding that involves the transfer of the information described in this Policy.
