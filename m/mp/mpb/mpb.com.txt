What are Cookies?
Cookies are very small text files stored on your Internet device (such as your browser or smart phone). When you visit a website, a Cookie is sent to your device with information about your visit. This information is used on any subsequent visits, to enhance your user experience, or to allow the website owner to monitor your behaviour on their website. For example, retail websites use cookies to remember what was in your shopping basket if you leave the site, and return again later.
What does this mean for me, and are they dangerous?
Cookies can seem unnerving as it may suggest that a website is gathering and storing personal information about you. This is simply not the case. Cookies store information about user behaviour rather than information about the user themselves. They are intended to make your Internet experience more personalised and tailored to you. Cookies are no more dangerous than having any file with your information in it stored on your computer. Cookies can in no way transmit viruses to your computer.
Cookies and MPB
The Cookies we send are used by us primarily for behaviour tracking. They enable us to monitor how our customers use our website, for example whether they have visited us before or not. We also use Cookies to store your Shopping Basket contents, and your login details. Cookies are also used in “remarketing”. This means that if you are browsing a different website, sometimes you will see advertisements for our website. These are known as Third Party Cookies. See below for a list of all Cookies from www.mpbphotgraphic.co.uk and what they are there for.
