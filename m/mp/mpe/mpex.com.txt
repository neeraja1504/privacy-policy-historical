Our website security measures
You can access your personal information on our Website through a username and password that you create. This password is encrypted, and we recommend that you do not share it with anyone. We also encourage you to set a strong password for your account.

Please understand that, despite our best efforts, no security measures are completely fool-proof. We also regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks, and regularly seek new ways for enhancing the security of our services and protection of our users’ privacy. Furthermore, because certain areas on our Websites might be less secure than others, and since e-mail and instant messaging are not recognized as secure forms of communications, we request and encourage you not to share any personal information on any of these areas or via any of these methods.
