At MPOGD, we are committed to protecting your privacy and to developing technology that gives you the most powerful and secure online experience.

But sometimes we do need information to provide services that you request, and this statement of privacy explains data collection and use in those situations. Please read the complete MPOGD.com privacy statement.
Collecting your Personal Information
We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you (personal information) or allows us to contact you. Generally, this information is requested when you are asked to register before entering a contest, rating games or posting to the forum. Personal information collected by MPOGD.com often is limited to e-mail address, language, country or location, but may include other information when needed to provide a service you requested.

We use your personal information for four primary purposes:
To make the site easier for you to use by not making you enter your personal information more than once.
To help us create and deliver content most relevant to you.

Inside the company, data is stored in password-controlled servers with limited access. Your information may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country where MPOGD, its subsidiaries, affiliates or agents are located.
