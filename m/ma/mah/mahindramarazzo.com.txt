1. Collection of Personally Identifiable Information and other Information
When you use our Website, we collect and store your personal information which is provided by
you from time to time. Our primary goal in doing so is to provide you a safe, efficient, smooth and
customized experience. This allows us to provide services and features that most likely meet your
needs, and to customize our Website to make your experience safer and easier. More importantly,
while doing so we collect personal information from you that we consider necessary for achieving
this purpose.
In general, You can browse the Website without telling us who You are or revealing any personal
information about yourself. Once you give us Your personal information, You are not anonymous to
us. Where possible, we indicate which fields are required and which fields are optional. You always
have the option to not provide information by choosing not to use a particular service or feature on
the Website. We may automatically track certain information about You based upon your behaviour
on our Website. We use this information to do internal research on our users' demographics,
interests, and behaviour to better understand, protect and serve our users. This information is
compiled and analysed on an aggregated basis. This information may include the URL that You just
came from (whether this URL is on our Website or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL
is on our Website or not), your computer browser information, and your IP address.
We use data collection devices such as "cookies" on certain pages of the Website to help analyse
our web page flow, measure promotional effectiveness, and promote trust and safety. "Cookies"
are small files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing our services. We offer certain
features that are only available through the use of a "cookie".
We also use cookies to allow You to enter your password less frequently during a session. Cookies
can also help us provide information that is targeted to Your interests. Most cookies are "session
cookies," meaning that they are automatically deleted from Your hard drive at the end of a session.
You are always free to decline our cookies if Your browser permits, although in that case You may
not be able to use certain features on the Website and You may be required to re-enter your
password more frequently during a session
Additionally, you may encounter "cookies" or other similar devices on certain pages of the Website
that are placed by third parties. We do not control the use of cookies by third parties.

to resolve disputes, provide customer support and troubleshoot problems as permitted by law.
If You send us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other users or third parties
send us correspondence about Your activities or postings on the Website, we may collect such
information into a file specific to You.
We collect personally identifiable information (email address, name, phone number, credit card /
debit card / other payment instrument details, etc.) from You when You set up a free account with

We identify and use Your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer
our Website. Your IP address is also used to help identify You and to gather broad demographic
information.
We will occasionally ask You to complete optional online surveys. These surveys may ask you for
contact information and demographic information (like zip code, age, or
income level). We use this data to tailor Your experience at our Website, providing You with content
that we think You might be interested in and to display content according to Your preferences.
Cookies

request where such services are provided by more than one corporate entity. Those entities and
affiliates may not market to You as a result of such sharing unless You explicitly opt-in.
We may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that
such      disclosure   is    reasonably      necessary      to    respond      to    summons,       court
orders, or other legal process. We may disclose personal information to law enforcement offices,
third party rights owners, or others in the good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably
