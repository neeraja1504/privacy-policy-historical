THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND PROCESS:
User-provided information: When you use the Services, you may provide and we may collect what is generally called “personally identifiable” information, or “personal information,” which is information that specifically identifies an individual (which we will refer to in this Policy collectively as "Personal Data"). When you register to become a member of the Services, we collect your email address. Please note that without providing that data you are unable to create your user account for using Mavshack Services. If you create your Mavshack account via the Facebook, then we get your first name and last name from the Facebook. We also collect your IP address to verify which region you are coming from in order to use our Services (incl. watch Mavshack Movies). In addition, we log yours log-in and log-out time in our system and also log which content you are seeing on Mavshack.
You may provide us with Personal Data in various ways on the Services. For example, you provide us with Personal Data when you register for an account, use the Services, interact with other users of the Services through communication features, or send us customer service-related requests. We may, in accordance with applicable law, record your communication with our customer care, helpdesk or with other such contact points.
Automatically collected information: When you use the Services, we automatically collect certain non-personal information to help us understand how you use our Services and we may automatically record certain information from your device by using various types of technology, including “clear gifs" or “web beacons.” This “automatically collected" information may include your IP address or other device address or ID, web browser and/or device type, internet connectivity, the web pages or sites that you visit just before or just after you use the Services, the pages or other content you view or otherwise interact with on the Services, and the dates and times that you visit, access, or use the Services. We also may use these technologies to collect information regarding your interaction with email messages, such as whether you opened, clicked on, or forwarded a message. This information is gathered from all users.
“Cookies" Information: When you use the Services, we may send one or more cookies – small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters – to your device. We use cookies to improve the quality of our Services and make the Services easier to use. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Services. The cookies will help us, among others, to remember you and your preferences while using our Services. Please review your web browser “Help" file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings. Please note that if you delete, or choose not to accept, cookies from the Services, you may not be able to utilize the features of the Services to their fullest potential.
Data from Google Analytics: Mavshack may use Google Analytics on the Services to create user navigation reports for our Services (e.g. Mavschack.com) administrators. We take measures to protect the technical information collected by our use of Google Analytics. Your Personal Data will only be used on a need to know basis to resolve technical issues, to administer the Services and identify visitor preferences. Any statistical reports or Services traffic information are exclusively accessed by authorised personnel within our company. We do not use any of this information to identify visitors and we do not share it with third parties. Google operates independently from us and has its own privacy policy in place, which we strongly suggest you review ( Google Privacy Policy). Google may use the information collected by our use of Google Analytics to evaluate users' activity on our Services. For more information, see Google Analytics Privacy. You may opt out from sending navigation information about your visit to the Services to Google Analytics by using the Google Analytics Opt-out page.
Third Party Web Beacons and Third Party Buttons: We may also implement third-party content or advertising on the Services that may use clear gifs or other forms of web beacons, which allow the third-party content provider to read and write cookies to your browser in connection with your viewing of the third party content on the Services. Additionally, we may implement third party buttons (such as Facebook “like” or “share” buttons) that may allow third parties to collect information about you through such third parties’ browser cookies, even when you do not interact with the button. Information collected through web beacons and buttons is collected directly by these third parties, and Mavshack does not participate in that data transmission. Information collected by a third party in this manner is subject to that third party’s own data collection, use, and disclosure policies. Please take a closer look at the paragraph below “Sharing Your Personal Data With Third Parties”.
Information from Other Sources. We may obtain information, including Personal Data, from third parties and sources other than the Services, such as our partners and advertisers. If we combine or associate information from other sources with Personal Data that we collect through the Services, we will treat the combined information as Personal Data in accordance with this Policy.

research purposes, for example, to conduct market research;
sending you newsletters or other periodic communications from us, if you have opted into receiving the abovementioned info.

Other than as set forth in this Policy, except for aggregate demographic information that we may share with third parties in a manner that does not link such information to any individual, we will not share your Personal Data with third parties unless you have given us permission to do so.
CHILDREN’S PRIVACY:
Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. You must be 18 years of age or older to subscribe to our Services. We do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of 18 without obtaining parental consent. In case the person under the age of 18 will get the possibility and access to utilize the Services, they may do so only with the involvement, supervision, and approval of a parent or legal guardian, and subject to our Terms of Service. If we learn that Personal Data has been collected on the Services from persons under 18 years of age and without verifiable parental consent, then we will take the appropriate steps to delete this information. If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under 18 years of age has obtained an account on the Services, then you may alert us at legal@mavshack.com and request that we delete that child’s Personal Data from our systems.
SHARING YOUR PERSONAL DATA WITH THIRD PARTIES:
We do not sell, lease, rent or otherwise disclose your personal data to third parties unless otherwise stated in the following section.
We may share your personal data if we have your consent to do so. Some Services may allow you to share your personal data with other users of the Services or with other services and their users. Please consider carefully before disclosing any personal data or other information that might be accessible to other users.
We may share your personal data with Mavshack AB subsidiaries and affiliates or authorized third parties who process personal data for Mavshack AB for the purposes described in this Policy. These authorized third parties are not permitted to use your personal data for any other purposes. We require them to act consistently with this Policy and to use appropriate security measures to protect your personal data.
Our Services may be provided using resources and servers located in various countries around the world. Therefore your personal data may be transferred across international borders outside the country where you use our Services, including to the countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA) that do not have laws providing specific protection for personal data or that have different legal rules on data protection, for example, the United States of America. In such cases we take steps to ensure that there is a legal basis for such a transfer and that adequate protection for your personal data is provided as required by applicable law, for example, by using standard agreements approved by relevant authorities (where necessary) and by requiring the use of other appropriate technical and organizational information security measures.
We may be obligated by mandatory law to disclose your personal data to certain authorities or other third parties, for example, to law enforcement agencies in the countries where we or third parties acting on our behalf operate. We may also disclose and otherwise process your personal data in accordance with applicable law to defend Mavshack AB's legitimate interests, for example, in civil or criminal legal proceedings.
If we decide to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize our businesses in certain countries, this may involve us disclosing personal data to prospective or actual purchasers and their advisers, or receiving personal data from sellers and their advisers.
Third party services installed on your mobile device, computer, PC or other device may allow access to information available on your respective device. We may contract with companies or persons to provide certain services including cooperation for technology solutions, data management, promotional and advertising services. We provide our partners with the information needed for them to perform these services. We may make certain automatically-collected, aggregated, or otherwise non-personally-identifiable information available to third parties for various purposes, including compliance with various reporting obligations; for business or marketing purposes; or to assist such parties in understanding our users’ interests, habits, and usage patterns for certain programs, content, services, and/or functionality available through the Services. Our Services may contain links to other companies' websites and services that have privacy policies of their own (like payment service provider Braintree, Fortumo,  PayPal, Citrus, Amazon Kindle, Apple’s in-app purchase via Mavshack iOS app; social media network Facebook, etc). In addition, Mavshack is using the services of its partners for cloud services (like Akamai Technologies AB). All these partners may have the policies regarding the handling of personal information which may differ from ours. We recommend that you read the privacy policies of such third party services before you start using these respective services. Mavshack is not responsible for the privacy practices or contents of any such third party services.
