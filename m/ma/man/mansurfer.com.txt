II. Information Collection and Management
A. Personal Information
i. Information we collect
“Personally identifiable information” is information that can be used to identify or contact you, such as your name and e-mail address. Mount Equinox, Inc. only has access to the personally identifiable information that you provide to us. For example, we cannot determine your e-mail address unless you provide it. We cannot gain access to other information on your computer.
Those who visit only public areas of the Website and who do not join as members generally do not, provide us with any personally identifiable information.
Those who wish to join the site or sign up for our mailing list, must provide us with enough personal information to enable us to process the requested transaction. This generally includes, at a minimum, personally identifiable information such as name, e-mail address, date of birth, gender and your photograph, if you choose add one to your profile page. Members also select, and thereby provide, a username and password combination.
ii. How we use the information
Your personally identifiable information is used only to process the requested transaction, and occasionally to provide you with special offers from ManSurfer. On occasion, for example, we may send emails to introduce a product or service that we think will interest our subscribers.
ManSurfer will never intentionally disclose any personally identifying information to any third party, unless we are compelled to do so by law (for example, in response to a subpoena or court order), or if our obligation to maintain the privacy of your information has been waived or otherwise excused by you (for example, by your filing suit against us and asserting claims against which such information would be relevant in our defense). Please note that our lawyers, accountants, and/or vendors are not “third parties” for the purpose of this section to the extent that disclosure to them is necessary or desirable for the operation of our business. We may reveal your personal data to any other organization that buys, or to which we transfer all, or substantially all, of our assets and business. If this sale or transfer takes place, we will use reasonable efforts to try to make sure that the organization we transfer your personal data to uses it in line with our privacy policy.
iii. Opt-out policy
Non members don't provide us with any personally identifiable information so there is nothing to opt-out of. For those who choose to join your personal information is required for us to provide services to you as a registered user, you cannot opt-out of providing it and still receive those services. You can opt-out of receiving promotional emails by contacting support@mansurfer.com, or by clicking on the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the newsletter.

i. Information we collect
We also collect non-personally identifying information provided by your browser and/or our servers, such as the name and IP address of the domain from which you came from (if any), your IP address - a numerical code to identify your device and which can provide information about the country, region or city where you are based, details of your devices, for example, the unique device ID, unique advertising ID and browsers used to access our content, the amount of time you spent on each page and on the site as a whole, your browsing history of the content you have visited on our sites, and the path you followed through the site.

From time to time we may share this aggregate statistical information with partners, suppliers and other third parties, but it will not include any personally identifiable information.
