2. COLLECTION OF INFORMATION AND USE BY MANTERESTING
2.1 Collection of information
You are free to browse the Site without revealing any personal information making it possible to identify you. However, once you have sent us your identifiable personal information, you are no longer anonymous to us.
We collect two types of information from Users/Organizers of the Site: “Automatic Anonymous Information” (hereafter known as “AAI”) and “Identifiable Personal Information” (hereafter known as “IPI”). We process AAI and IPI differently, and the following articles describe both AAI and IPI and indicate how each type of information is collected and used by Manteresting.
The Site includes functions that make it possible to monitor certain information automatically, based on your behavior. This information does not identify you personally. We use this information to improve the Content and functionality of the Site, and to better understand and satisfy our visitors. This information may include the browser you use, your IP address or other information. This information is referred to herein as the AAI.
IPI is individually identifiable information about you that allows us to identify or contact you. Some of the Site’s functions require asking you for certain IPI, such as your e-mail address, billing address, and/or other personal information. You may choose to provide IPI in order to access certain functions on the Site, to Publish your Content, to create an Account, to organize your Content, or to make comments. When possible, we tell you which fields of information are required and which are optional. You can always choose not to provide certain information, but in that case it may be that you cannot use certain of the Site’s functions mentioned above.

The following provisions describe some of the ways in which your IPI may be disclosed to third parties: we may make use of third parties to provide functions on our behalf in order to improve our communication and our efforts in the areas of promotion, marketing or other services. These third parties may include approved service providers, consultants and other companies working with us (referred to collectively as “Representatives”). They have access only to the IPI necessary to perform their functions and may not share the IPI with others or use it for any purpose other than providing or improving the Site.
