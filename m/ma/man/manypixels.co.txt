Privacy Policy · ManyPixels
Effective as of January 25, 2019
1. INTRODUCTION
At ManyPixels PTE LTD, we collect, use and share personal data in accordance with privacy laws to make sure your data protection rights are implemented and enforced. We integrate various technical solutions to comply with applicable laws and rules related to personal data protection in countries where we operate. This Privacy Policy sets forth the basic rules and principles by which we process your personal data, and mentions our responsibilities while processing personal data.
We may be a data processor or data controller according to the applicable law. Regardless of our status, we will deal with any personal data as required by any applicable regulation, including but not limited to, Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (the “ GDPR ”).
We do not knowingly attempt to solicit or receive information from children. Our services do not aim at children. The concrete age of the children are defined differently, so any case involving a child will be reviewed individually.
We understand that you are aware of and care about your own privacy interests, and we take that seriously. This Privacy Policy describes the rules and practices with regard to the collection and use of your personal data and details your privacy rights. We recognize that privacy is an ongoing responsibility, and so we will from time to time update this Privacy Policy as we undertake new personal data practices or adopt new privacy and security rules.
Our data protection officer is Geoffrey Merran, Address: 28C, Stanley Street, Singapore 068737; email: geoffrey@manypixels.co
2. TERMS WE USE AS LEGAL GUIDELINES OF THE PROCESSING
There are some legal bases for the processing of your personal data and we count on them to process your personal data. We use the main three bases to process your personal data: consent, contract, and legitimate interest.
Consent - your clear agreement to the processing of your personal data for a specific purpose.
Contract - the reason why the processing is necessary based on a contract you have with us, or because we have asked you to take specific steps before entering into that contract.
Legitimate Interests - the reason why the processing your data is necessary which is based on the legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of a third party, provided those interests are not outweighed by your rights and interests.
Articles 6(1) and 9(2) of the GDPR also indicate other legal grounds for the processing and when applicable we will count on such grounds.
3. CONSENT RULE AND INTERRELATION WITH OTHER LEGAL GROUNDS
If you have given consent to the processing of your data you can freely withdraw such consent at any time by emailing us or contacting via other available communication channels.
If you do withdraw your consent, and if we do not have another legal basis for the processing of your data, then we will stop the processing of the personal data.
If we have another legal basis for the processing of your data, then we may continue to do so, subject to your legal interests and rights.
4. OUR RESPONSIBILITIES
As we may have both roles as a data controller and data processor, we have obligations according to the GDPR. We act as a data controller when we determine the purposes and means of the processing of your personal data. As a data processor, we process personal data on behalf of the controller.
5. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR YOU
You should read this Privacy Policy carefully. We want to make sure that you understand all your rights. It is important for both of us that you maintain your personal data confidential and secure.
If you provide us with personal data about other individuals, we will only employ that data for the special reason for which it was provided to us. By sending the data, you shall be sure that you have the right to dispose to process the personal data on your behalf in accordance with this Privacy Policy. In case if you submit third party’s personal data, be sure that you have a legal basis for the processing of such data.
According to the applicable law, you may become a data controller/processor and it will impose on you additional obligations.

Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit the Website. Cookies are used by the Website in order to make the Website work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.
You may turn off cookies in your browser via settings. You can block cookies on your browser refusing cookies. You may delete cookies. If you turn off cookies, you can continue to use the Website and browse its pages, but the Website and certain services will not work properly.
The list of cookies we use is listed in your browser or there is a list of types of such cookies.
Type of cookie | Purpose
---|---
Essential Cookies | These cookies are essential to provide you with services available on the Website and to enable you to use some of our features. Without these cookies, the services that you have asked for cannot be provided, and we only use these cookies to provide you with those services.
Functionality Cookies | These cookies allow the Website to remember choices you make when you use the Website. The purpose of these cookies is to provide you with more personal experience and to avoid you having to re-enter your preferences every time you visit.
Analytics and Performance Cookies | These cookies are used to collect information about traffic and how users use the Website. The information gathered does not identify any individual visitor. It includes the number of visitors to the Website, the websites that referred them to the Website, the pages they visited on the Website, what time of day they visited the Website, whether they have visited the Website before, and other similar information.
Targeted and advertising cookies | These cookies track your browsing habits to enable us to show advertising which is more likely to be of interest to you. These cookies use information about your browsing history to group you with other users who have similar interests. Based on that information, and with our permission, third-party advertisers can place cookies to enable them to show adverts which we think will be relevant to your interests while you are on third party websites. You can disable cookies which remember your browsing habits and target advertising at you by visiting http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices. If you choose to remove targeted or advertising cookies, you will still see adverts but they may not be relevant to you.

In particular, we collect and transfer to Singapore personal data only: with your consent; to perform a contract with you, or to fulfill a compelling legitimate interest in a manner that does not outweigh your rights and freedoms. We aim to apply appropriate safeguards to protect your privacy, security, your personal data and to use your personal data only consistent with your relationship with our company and the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
