Many Tricks · Privacy: Cookies and Data
Cookies
To make this site work properly, we sometimes place small data files called cookies on your computer or device—most any website does this in today's environment.
What are cookies?
A cookie is a small text file that a website saves on your computer or mobile device when you visit the site. It enables the website to remember your actions and preferences (such as login, language, font size and other display preferences) over a period of time, so you don’t have to keep re-entering them whenever you come back to the site or browse from one page to another.
How do we use cookies?
We use a third-party service to track and report on which services create cookies on the Many Tricks site. You can see a full list of those services, and why they use cookies, by viewing our Cookie Detail page.
Do you have to accept cookies?
Our site's cookies are not strictly necessary for our site to work, but they will provide you with a better browsing experience. You can delete or block these cookies, but if you do that, some features of this site may not work as intended.
You can control and/or delete cookies as you wish — for details, see aboutcookies.org. You can delete all cookies that are already on your computer, and you can set most browsers to prevent them from being placed. If you do this, however, you may have to manually adjust some preferences every time you visit our site, and some services and functionalities may not work.
Data
As a general statement, we do not directly collect much personal information on either our web site visitors or our customers. Here is a complete list of what may be collected and under what situations:
Our blog is powered by WordPress; if you register for a blog account, your user name, email address, personal URL (if you choose to provide one), and date of registration are recorded in our local WordPress database. If you post a comment to a blog entry, visitors will see your username and URL (if you provided one). If you choose to follow our blog via email, your email address is stored on wordpress.com, as they're the providers of this service.
Our support system is powered by osTicket. If you register for a support account, your email address, user name, account creation date, and time zone are saved in the database. The support system is private; any tickets you create will be visible only to yourself and us here at Many Tricks.
While we sell our apps on our site, we do not process the sales transactions ourselves. That task is handled by FastSpring, which manages the entire process once you click the Buy Now button for one of our apps—we are not involved in the collection or online storage of any of your purchase-related data. (Once the purchase is complete, we receive an email with your name, email address, and a list of which apps you purchased. We can also view more data on FastSpring's site, but this data resides on their servers, not ours.) This page on the FastSpring site explains their privacy policy, and offers a wealth of detail on how they handle and secure your data.
The data for our blog and ticket systems resides on our server; FastSpring's data is not on our server. We do not sell, transfer, or give away any of the data we directly hold, and FastSpring's privacy page covers their data usage rules. We may occasionally contact customers via email in the event of an issue with one of our apps, but this would be done directly by us, not by transferring an email list to a third party.
