Manilla Privacy Policy
Version 1.5
(effective as February 26, 2011)
At Manilla, our most important asset is our relationship with you.  Manilla (“Manilla” or “we” or “us”) is committed to maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and security of personally identifiable information about our current and prospective users.  We take the utmost care in protecting your privacy when you visit Manilla.com (the “Site”) or use the service we provide (the “Service”).  This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and disclose information that we collect about you through the Service and how we protect the security of your personally identifiable information.  We regularly re-evaluate our privacy and security policies and adapt them as necessary to address new developments and new challenges.
1.                      We limit the information we collect.
Information will be collected directly by Manilla or by third party services providers with whom we contract to act on our behalf.  We require any third party services provider to hold your information securely and in confidence and to use it only to fulfill the function(s) they have been retained to perform. ****
Manilla collects the following categories of information about you                through                      the Service:
Information That You Enter.  We will collect any personally identifiable information that you provide when you register for Manilla and that you choose to enter through the Service (including in comments or other content that you submit to us).  This will include personally identifiable information such as your name, email address, and zip code.
**** For third party websites that you wish to access and manage through our Service (your “Accounts”), we also will collect the passwords and user names that you provide to us.  We will only use this information in order to access those third party websites on your behalf for purposes of providing the Service.
We will ask you for information when you register, or at other times, such as if you choose to post to our blogs or respond to surveys that we may offer.  Please note that any personally identifiable information you voluntarily submit on a blog or other public areas we will from time to time offer on the Site can be viewed and used by other users, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.  Manilla is not responsible for your disclosure of information in these forums.
Information from Third Party Web Sites.  In order to display financial information to you within the Service, we collect, on your behalf, and aggregate (for your viewing only) account information, documents, and other personally identifiable information from Accounts that you register on the Service
Automated Access Information.  Through a variety of methods that are widely used on the Internet, we also will automatically collect information about your computer or mobile device when you access and use the Site.  For example, when you visit Manilla.com, we may collect your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, which is a number automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet Services Provider whenever you use the Internet.  We also may collect and retain information about the pages you visit on the Manilla.com website; the website or search engine, if any, that referred you to Manilla.com; the website you visit after Manilla.com; other information about the type of web browser, computer, platform, related software and settings you are using; any search terms you have entered on this website or a referral site; other web usage activity and data logged by our web servers; and information relating to advertising, such as the ads you see, and the ads you click on.  Similarly, if you use a mobile device to access the Services, we may collect information about that device, such as the type of mobile device you use, your mobile telephone number, or a device identifier, as well as the date, time, and content of your messages relevant to your use of our mobile services.  As the Internet evolves, we may also collect other types of information, consistent with this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use.
We use this automated information for internal system administration, to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our website.  Such information also may be used to gather broad demographic information, such as country of origin and Internet Service Provider.  We also may link this information with your personal information when we feel that it is necessary to enforce compliance with our rules and policies or Terms of Use or to protect our Site, customers, or others.

Manilla uses various technologies to store information on your computer and / or mobile device and to provide you with content, including cookies and web beacons.  Cookies are text files we place in your computer’s and / or mobile device’s browser.  These will be used to store your preferences, to personalize your experience at the Site, and to save your password.  If you want to use the Service, you must leave cookies enabled.

We use firewall barriers, SSL 128-bit encryption techniques and authentication procedures, and other technical measures to maintain the security of your online session and to protect Manilla accounts and systems from unauthorized access.  To learn more about our security practices see security@manilla.com.
We strive to use the highest commercially acceptable means to protect your personally identifiable information, but no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, can be 100% secure at all times.  Therefore, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your personally identifiable information.  In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your personally identifiable information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we will seek to notify you as promptly as possible in the circumstances, by email or other means where we deem in our discretion that such notification is appropriate.
Manilla also has designed a security program to protect the security of customer information, protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security of that information, and protect against unauthorized access to such information that could result in harm to our customers.  Under the Manilla security program, only Manilla employees whose job functions require access to customer information will have access to your personally identifiable information, and even in those cases they will only be authorized to use it for the purposes that are required to provide the Service and otherwise comply with our Terms of Use. All Manilla employees undergo financial and criminal background checks as a condition of employment. Your personal data and documents are encrypted and stored in a facility protected by 24 x 7 security and biometric controls. We don’t store your personal information in logs or other unsecured repositories, and we don’t search or extract data from your documents.
