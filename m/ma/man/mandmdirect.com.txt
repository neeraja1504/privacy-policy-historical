Security details for MandMDirect.com. adidas , Ben Sherman, Diesel, Nike and loads more.
Ordering and paying for online orders with MandMDirect is both safe and secure.
Security is one of the greatest fears when placing online orders and we as a company have invested in a totally secure and safe site for you to shop. Once you checkout, we encrypt all your details using Internet standard encryption technology (TSL/SSL).
If a site is secure, a padlock will appear in the bottom right hand section of your screen when you are in the Personal Data/ payment card entry area. Occasionally the padlock will not be visible but the page is still secure. If you do not see the padlock, you can check by right-clicking anywhere on the page (except on an image) and select Properties. If the URL starts https : the s indicates that the page is secure.
We are committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected. This Privacy Policy explains how we use the information we collect about you, how you can instruct us if you prefer to limit the use of that information and procedures that we have in place to safeguard your privacy.
The information we collect and how we use it
When you register with our website we need to know your name, email address, correspondence address, contact telephone numbers and payment card details. We gather this information to allow us to process your orders and provide you with the information/goods requested. From time to time we may provide your information to our customer service agencies for research and analysis purposes so that we can monitor and improve the services we provide. We or our agents and sub-contractors may contact you by post, email, SMS or telephone to ask you for your feedback and comments on our services. In addition we may use and share the information (which we will keep for a reasonable period) for marketing and profiling your preferences.
How we protect your information
The Internet is not a secure medium. However we have put in place various security procedures as set out in this policy, including firewall security and password protection.

Your consent
By submitting your information you consent to the use of that information as set out in this Policy. If we change our Privacy Policy we will post the changes on this page, and may place notices on other pages of the website, so that you may be aware of the information we collect and how we use it at all times. Continued use of the service will signify that you agree to any such changes. Owing to the global nature of the internet infrastructure, the information you provide may be transferred to companies based in countries outside the European Economic Area that do not have similar protections in place regarding your data and its use as set out in this policy. However, we have taken the steps outlined above to try to improve the security of your information, and where we pass your information to such companies (other than in transit across the internet), we will ensure that they treat your information with the same level of protection as if we were dealing with it ourselves. By submitting your information you confirm your consent to these transfers.

Our advertising partner will serve ads that it believes are most likely to be of interest to you, based on information about your visit to this and other websites (this information is anonymous in that it does not include your name, street address, e-mail address or telephone number). In order to do this, our advertising partner may need to place a cookie (a small text file) on your computer.
