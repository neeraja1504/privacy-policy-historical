Cookies and General Information

When you register on our website, we may ask for personally identifiable information such as your name, email address, birth date, gender, address, city and state of residence, and ZIP code. From time to time, we may also ask you optionally to provide other information. If you choose to provide such information, you are giving ManiaTV the permission to use and store it consistent with this Privacy Policy.
In addition, ManiaTV collects information about your transactions with us and with some of our business partners. For example, ManiaTV automatically receives and records information from your computer and browser, including your IP address, software and hardware attributes, the page you request, and cookie information.
ManiaTV collects personally identifiable information in order to establish and enhance our relationship with you. Also, it helps us deliver a premium user experience. ManiaTV's use of this information includes the following general purposes: contacting you, customizing the content and advertising you view, fulfilling your requests for products or services, identifying the comments you post on the ManiaTV Site, improving our services, conducting research, and compiling aggregate data for internal and external business purposes.
Cookies, as used by every major website, are small bits of information placed on the hard drive of your computer. Cookies remember information about your activities on a website. For example, cookies can store your session for easy sign-in to a website you have previously visited. They enable us to make your visits to the ManiaTV Site more enjoyable. Information about your activities on the ManiaTV Site, which we obtain through cookies, and other non-personally identifiable information about you may also be used to serve you online ads that we believe are consistent with your interests.
ManiaTV may display targeted advertisements based on information about you, such as your interests. ManiaTV does not provide any personally identifiable information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad, although advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click targeted ads meet the targeting criteria.
Some advertisements displayed in connection with the ManiaTV Services also may contain cookies set by third party internet advertisers. We do not control these cookies and users of the ManiaTV Services should check the privacy policy of the entity who is delivering the ad and the entity whose ad is displayed to understand whether and how they use cookies..
We also may use services that collects data remotely by using so-called "pixel tags," "web beacons," "clear GIFs," or similar means (collectively, "Pixel Tags"), which can be embedded on the ManiaTV Site or on a third party's website. A Pixel Tag is an object that is embedded in a web page. It is usually invisible to users but allows website operators to check whether a user has viewed a particular web page. Pixel Tags collect only a limited set of information, including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the Pixel Tag resides. You may not decline Pixel Tags, however, they can be rendered ineffective by declining all cookies or modifying your browser setting to notify you each time a cookie is tendered and permit you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis. You can program your computer to warn you each time a cookie is being sent or to refuse cookies completely. However, unless you accept cookies you will not have access to certain ManiaTV Services.
Aggregate data is information (originally personally identifiable or non-personally identifiable) that subsequently is used in aggregate form. We may use aggregate data for purposes of research or analysis. We may conduct research about customer demographics, internet use, and interests and behavior based on personally identifiable information we gather. Although aggregate data may be based in part on personally identifiable information about you (for example, we may want to know the general age range of visitors watching shows on our site), it does not identify you personally. ManiaTV may share this type of aggregate data with a variety of third parties, including its affiliates, advertisers and other current and prospective business partners. But because this form of data does not identify particular users, these third parties will not be able to contact you based solely on this data.
We may use aggregate data collected for website administration, advertising, and promotional purposes, and we may share this information with various affiliated and unaffiliated entities. For example, IP addresses are used for the purposes of system administration and to provide anonymous aggregated data to advertisers about the volume of use on the ManiaTV Services. We may also enter into agreements with outside companies that possess the technology that allows us to customize the advertising and marketing messages you receive while using the ManiaTV Services. Your non-personally identifiable information and clickstream data about your activities may be shared with these companies so this customization can be accomplished. Our agreement with these companies restricts them from sharing your information with third parties or using it for any other purpose. Clickstream and demographic information may also be shared with our advertisers and business partners.

If you submit a Notice of Copyright Infringement pursuant to the Terms of Use, we will send a copy to the person or entity who uploaded, stored, or transmitted the material addressed by the communication. If we sell all or part of our business, or make a sale or transfer of assets, or are otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy, we may transfer your personally identifiable information to a third party as part of that transaction.
