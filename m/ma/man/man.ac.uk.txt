We are keen to communicate our activities, institutional views, latest news and points of excellence with staff, stakeholders, students, alumni and supporters. We do this by providing information through a range of online and offline channels including publications, events, press releases, social media and email.
In order to do this we have a database that contains personal data collected by the University during the course of our relationship with our stakeholders, staff, students, and alumni.  We aim to keep your data up to date and welcome any updates to your details or corrections to any inaccuracies you may wish to provide.
You have a right to request copies of the data held about you by the University. To do so, please contact dataprotection@manchester.ac.uk.

These include the following communications and marketing activities (by mail, email and telephone):
Sending University publications;
Promoting our services;
Notifying you of upcoming events;
Promoting discounts and opportunities.
Tools may be used to help us improve the effectiveness of our communications with you, including tracking whether the emails we send are opened and which links are clicked within a message.
Lastly, we use data to undertake analysis projects to ensure only effective and relevant communications are sent to you. A list of suppliers can be provided on request.
We utilise tools and resources to help us understand our stakeholders, staff, students, and alumni and gather information from publicly available resources (e.g. the electoral register, press, the charity register) to assess the capacity of these groups to support the University.
