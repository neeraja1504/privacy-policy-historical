Credit Card Transactions.
Some features of the Manaleak site enable credit card transactions via Paypal and NoChex. Manaleak assures you that we have taken measures to make such transactions secure for our members.
Paypal and NoChex utilize industry standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) servers to encrypt your information and prevent unauthorized access.
Shortly after an order is processed, you will receive a confirmation via e-mail. You are advised to print out and save a copy of the order confirmation for verification necessary to resolve any issues with your order.
We guarantee that every transaction will be 100 percent safe. This means you are not responsible for unauthorized transactions posted to your credit card that occur as a result of submitting a credit card number to Paypal or NoChex. Paypal and NoChex uses industry standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) servers on our transaction pages. SSL encrypts all of your personal information including name, address, and credit card number to prevent unauthorized access as the information travels over the Internet.
