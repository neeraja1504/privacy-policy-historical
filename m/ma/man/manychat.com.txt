Privacy policy
Last Updated: May 23, 2018
At manychat.com we consider the privacy of our visitors, and the security of their personal information, to be extremely important. This Privacy Policy document describes, in detail, the types of personal information we collect and record at manychat.com, and how we use this information.
LOG FILES
Like many other Web sites, manychat.com makes use of log files. These files merely log visitors to the site - usually a standard procedure for hosting companies, and a part of hosting services's analytics. The information inside the log files includes: internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date/time stamp, referring/exit pages, and in some cases, the number of clicks. This information is used to analyze trends, administer the site, track a user's movement around the site, and to gather demographic information. IP addresses, and other such information, are not linked to any information that is personally identifiable.
COLLECTING INFORMATION
WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT:
What we collect depends largely on the interaction that takes place between you and ManyChat, most of which can be categorized under the following:
Using ManyChat Software as a Service. When you use any ManyChat Software as a Service, we store all the content you provide, including but not limited to accounts created for team members, files, pictures, project information, and any other information that you provide to the services you use.
For any ManyChat Software as a Service, we also collect data about usage of the software. This may include, but is not limited to, numbers of users, flows, broadcasts etc.

These third parties are governed by their own agreements.
User generated content. Our products and services often give you the option to provide feedback, such as suggestions, compliments or problems encountered. We invite you to provide such feedback as well as to participate with comments on our blog and community page. If you choose to post a comment, your user name, city, and any other information that you choose to post will be visible to the public.

As part of our Services, we may use and incorporate into features information you have provided, we have collected from you, or we have collected about Subscribers.
If you are a Subscriber and no longer want to be contacted by one of our users, please unsubscribe directly from that user’s bot or contact the user directly to update or delete your data.
Information automatically collected. Our servers may automatically record certain information about how you use our Site (we refer to this information as “Log Data“), including both Clients and casual visitors. Log Data may include information such as a user’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, device and browser type, operating system, the pages or features of our Site to which a user browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, the frequency with which the Site is used by a user, search terms, the links on our Site that a user clicked on or used, and other statistics. We use this information to administer the Service and we analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) this information to improve and enhance the Service by expanding its features and functionality and tailoring it to our users’ needs and preferences.
Sensitive personal information. Subject to the following paragraph, we ask that you not send or disclose to us any sensitive personal information (e.g., social security numbers, information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, biometrics or genetic characteristics, criminal background or union membership) on or through the Service or otherwise.
