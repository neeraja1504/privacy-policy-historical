Privacy and the MangomindSM Service
HOW DO WE PROTECT THE SECURITY AND QUALITY OF THE INFORMATION AND FILES STORED ON THE MANGOMIND SERVICE?
Mangomind has been designed to offer the best-in-class security architecture by strong encryption applied exclusively at the client in combination with world-class challenge/response authentication.
Data you place on the Mangomind service is encrypted before it leaves your computer. This data remains encrypted on the servers and is not accessible in any decrypted form to Mangosoft or anyone with access to the Mangomind servers. Then, only after it is downloaded by you or those you specifically invite to access your Mangomind drives is it ever decrypted.
We believe that Mangomind is so secure that information and files you place on the Mangomind service just as secure, if not more secure, than the data stored on servers in your private LANs.
Mangomind's connection authentication and data encryption components are described briefly here. For a more thorough description, please see the Mangomind Security White Paper.
Connection Authentication. When a Mangomind client computer connects to the Mangomind server, Connection Authentication validates that both are who they say they are. This means that someone else cannot pretend to be a Mangomind server, tricking your Mangomind software into sending it your data. And vice-versa -- no Mangomind client that you haven't invited to the drive can trick a Mangomind server into sending it your data. This authentication is performed through a challenge/response protocol using the RSA Public/Private key pairs of both parties. Every new connection made must successfully complete the challenge protocol.
Data Encryption. Mangomind encrypts your data using RSA 128 bit RC5 data encryption keys. Your data is encrypted with these keys on your Mangomind client just before it is sent on the wire to the Mangomind server. Once on the server, it remains encrypted. At no point after leaving your computer can anyone view the clear text version of your files. Most importantly, we employ a unique encryption key management system so that the usable keys are only available on the client machines. Only the client computer can download and then decrypt the data. Since the usable keys are not available anywhere on the server, no one can view your data by looking at the data contained there. Even the names of your files are changed on the server to meaningless strings so as not to hint at their contents.

We use cookies to save your password so that you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our Web Site.

We have no control over those cookies, nor does this Privacy Policy cover how your personal information contained in those cookies may be used or protected. If you have any questions about the cookies of such third parties, or about the use of your personal information by such third parties, you should contact the site administrator or web-master of the third party site.
