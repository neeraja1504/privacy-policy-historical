Cookies ****

Other technologies
We may gather information about you automatically through your use of the Site, e.g., your IP address and how you navigate the Site. When you visit the Site, we may collect information by automated means, including technologies such as pixel tags, browser analysis tools, server logs and web beacons. This information is not personally-identifiable. We use this information to better understand, customize and improve user experience with our Sites, Services and offerings as well as to manage our advertising.

For example, we use information we collect about all website users to optimize our Sites and to understand website traffic patterns. We may aggregate and/or de-identify the data about visitors to our Site and use it for product and service development and to improve the quality of our products and Services.

International Transfers of Your Information
If you are visiting this site or utilizing services from a country other than the United States or Canada, the various communications you send and receive will necessarily result in the transfer of information across international boundaries. If you are located in the European Union you should be aware that information you provide or which is otherwise collected on this Site or through any services rendered may be transferred to countries (including the United States) which do not have data protection laws deemed as adequate as those in the EU.
In cases where Manduka needs to transfer Personal Information outside the European Union, we shall ensure that adequate safeguards, as required under applicable data protection legislation, will be implemented (including, as applicable, the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses, as appropriate).
How Long Do We Keep Your Information?
We keep your Personal Information to enable your continued use of Manduka’s Services, for as long as it is required in order to fulfil the relevant purposes described in this Privacy Policy, as may be required by applicable law, as necessary to protect our rights and interests, or as otherwise communicated to you. For example, we may retain your transaction history so that you can review past purchases (and repeat orders if desired) and what addresses you have shipped orders to, and to improve the relevancy of products and content we recommend.
Your Privacy Rights
Manduka will ensure that you can exercise your rights pertaining to your Personal Information, including rights as provided by various data protection laws. Manduka therefore informs you that, where applicable under relevant law, you are entitled:
* to have access to your Personal Information upon simple request – that is, you may receive a copy of such data (if requested), unless such data is made directly available to you, for instance within your personal account;
* to have access upon simple request, and free of charge, the categories and names of addresses of third parties that have received Personal Information for direct marketing purposes;
* to obtain a rectification of your Personal Information should it be inaccurate, incomplete or obsolete;
* to obtain the deletion of your Personal Information in the situations set forth by applicable data protection law (the “right to be forgotten”).
* to withdraw your consent to the data processing without affecting the lawfulness of processing, where your Personal Information has been collected and processed on the basis of your consent;
* to object to the processing of your Personal Information (where it has been collected and processed on the basis of legitimate interests of Manduka) in which case we may ask you to justify your request by explaining to us your particular situation;
* to request a limitation of the data processing in the situations set forth by applicable law;
* to have your Personal Information directly transferred by Manduka to a third-party processor of your choice (where technically feasible and when processing is based on your consent); and

Under certain laws, you may also have the right to “opt-out” of having your Personal Information sold to a third party. However, Manduka does not sell your Personal Information to any other party. Only in the case of a merger, sale, financing, acquisition, or other transaction involving all or part of Manduka may your information be involved in a transaction.
For deletion/”right to be forgotten” requests, we will undertake a good faith effort to accommodate requests for access to or deletion of personal information. However, these requests may be subject to the evaluation of additional factors, including disproportionate burden or expense, or the risk to the rights, including the privacy rights, of others.
We will strive and work to resolve any inquiry you may have regarding our privacy practices. EU residents may also file a complaint before a competent data protection authority regarding the processing of your Personal Data. While we suggest that you contact us beforehand, if you wish to exercise this right, you should contact the competent data protection authority directly.

Your Choices on Collection and Use of Information
You may change certain preferences in your account regarding the sharing and use of your information on our Site by visiting your account settings. Please note that some Site functionality may be impacted depending on the preferences you choose.
Manduka also offers individuals the opportunity to choose or “opt-in” to receive emails or other communications from us and/or our partners regarding offers, products, and services we feel may interest you. We will ask you if you want to receive such emails before we begin sending them to you. If have opted in to receive such communications from us but later decide you do not want to receive solicitations from us or our partners related to your account with us, you always can “opt-out” by accessing and editing your account information to no longer receive such offers and mailings, or by following the “unsubscribe” directions attached to such emails.
You also have the ability to change your browser’s and your device’s cookie settings, as described above.
Updating and Correcting Your Information
You can always update your basic account information by logging into your Manduka account. If you need to access, update, or delete other Personal Information we may have in another way or manner, please contact us at the address below. Note that we may limit additional requests to modify your Personal Information, such as if your request impacts other users’ privacy, concerns information that Manduka does not possess or control, is repetitive, is unlawful, or requires technical means disproportionate to the request.
Protecting Your Information
At Manduka, we take reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect your information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, and destruction.
While we strive to make your information as secure as possible, no transmission system or data network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, you acknowledge that there are data security and privacy limitations inherent to the Internet, and that the security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information exchanged between you and Manduka, and between you and other Manduka users, cannot be guaranteed.
