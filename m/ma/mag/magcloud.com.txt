This Privacy Policy informs you of our policies and practices regarding the collection, use, storage and disclosure of any Personal Information and Anonymous Information you submit to us through the Website or Services. It also describes your choices regarding use, access and correction of your personal information. The use of information collected through our service shall be limited to the purpose of providing the service for which the Client has engaged Blurb. Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms shall have the meanings assigned to such terms set forth in the Blurb Terms and Conditions that you can find at Terms and Conditions and which incorporate this Privacy Policy by reference.
"Personal Information" is any information that allows us (or others) to identify an individual person and would include (for example) your name, address, email address, IP Address or phone number, as well as other non-public information that is associated with or directly linked to such information.
An "Internet protocol address" or "IP Address" is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. In some cases, your IP Address stays the same from browser session to browser session; but if you use a consumer Internet access provider, your IP Address probably varies from session to session. We track IP Addresses solely in conjunction with session Cookies to analyze our web page flow and to determine the appropriate language settings for you based on your region if you did not previously indicate. You can find out more about the Cookies and other tracking technologies that we use and the purposes for which we use them in the section below headed 'Cookies'.
"Anonymous Information" means information or a combination of information that does not relate to or identify individual persons.
