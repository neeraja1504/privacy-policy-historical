As the art of exploration continuously evolves and unfolds myriads of discoveries, the Philippines take its stand to be included in one of the countries to provide a field for one of these amazing findings-the Guyabano. Reputed to be a miraculous fruit able to give a variety of use for the human’s benefits, the need to study it steadily rises.  Generally known as the Souroup, this fruit is called in the Philippines as the Guyabano. It is a fruit of the Annona muricata which belongs to the family of Custard apple trees. It also belongs to the same breed of the cherimoya and the pawpaw. As far as history is concerned it was brought to the Philippines at an early date by way of trade (the Galleons) from Mexico. What is unique about it is that among the other fruits of its genus, it is the only member suitable for preservation.     The guyabano has a lightweight but fragrant wood. It grows sweet scented white flowers which intensifies especially in the morning. It is usually 8-13 inches long and weighs 2.5 kilos. The guybano is dark green but when it is ripe the color turns yellow and its body becomes softer. It has black brown inedible seed. Aside from that, its inside is mostly made up of pulp and fiber. As for its taste the Guyabano is a mixture of various fruits; a combination of strawberry and pineapple with a hint of coconut. The taste buds would also detect markings of sour citrus within the pulp.      Soursoup is only produced in countries where the weather is tropical. And since the Philippines is a tropical country, the tree could be basically grown everywhere in the archipelago. It can grow in all kinds of soil and lives on high levels of humidity and temperatures above 37 degrees which is the secret to its survival. Any point below 5-3degrees could destroy the fruit.      In contrast to it being unpopular in the past, the guyabano is now starting to catch the eyes of many researchers. With the now innumerable studies on this fruit, there is a common factor which is noticeable among these researches. Most of these investigations are found to agree with one another in claiming the soursoup to have an effect which is 9,000 times stronger than that of the Adriamycin and that it could be employed for various types of cancers’ chemotherapy. What makes it amazing is that unlike chemotherapy the compounds of the guyabano only hunts down and kills cells that are cancerous and avoids the healthy ones. So that in contrast to chemotherapy, there is less, if none, harmful side effects resulting from its use such as hair loss, immune depression or extreme nausea. The most proven and known benefits of the Soursoup are as follows:     One can make sweet varieties out of its pulp such as ice cream, juice and candies     One can get rid of intestinal worms by chewing its leaves     Applying its leaves on wounds helps in faster healing     Fevers are neutralized by brewing its roots or when its leaves are mixed with bathing water     Its young leaves can be massaged to the skin for diseases such as rheumatism, eczema and pimples. It also prevents or reduces skin scars from wounds     In some countries, its leaves are said to draw in a good sleep when arranged inside pillows     Mixing its seeds with water and soap and spraying it on plants keeps away pests that are harmful     Head lice are destroyed by the oil extracts taken from its seeds     Aside from the lists given, research has also found out that the consumption of 225g of the guyabano’s pulp helps prevent disorders such as UTI, Constipation, Leg cramps, Water retention, Migraines, Anemia and pregnancy complications. However, there still are a number of doctors who deny the benefits of this fruit. But even so, this fruit has achieved the title of being a miraculous fruit.
With today’s trend where direct, private, and instant messages are of great help to people, consumers must be aware in choosing mobile apps especially if it has something to do with your personal info’s such as your contact list where clients, bank accounts and other important stuff are being saved.     Most of the time, mobile apps are being installed because of its popularity. When a wide audience seemed to use it even for just a short time, you should expect for others to try it too without really verifying its security measures.  SARAHAH Honesty App is supposedly an app that can be used in giving feedbacks anonymously. Seems like people nowadays are drawn into intriguing stuff more than ever. However accordingly the app works in such a way that the person who has been rated or given feedback has no way of tracing or replying to it. The creator of the app tend to give its users the chance to leave positive comments or feedbacks as an act of kindness while keeping their identity unknown.      However the entire community has been totally shocked (shookt) when it has been revealed that this app is actually unknowingly stealing your personal details such as your contact list. Aside from stealing, they make use of it by uploading it to their data base and who knows what they could do about it.      Once you installed this app, it will only take them a while to steal your info. Logging out from the app can't make any difference at all. The best thing to do is to never ever install it and be more cautious in choosing an app.
Having only six years of life span, the organization of La Solidaridad has accomplished lots because of the contributions of its prominent members. These people with their trivial pen names are namely Dr. Jose Rizal, Marcelo H. del Pilar, Antonio Luna, Mariano Ponce and Jose Maria Panganiban. The Pen names they used were Laong Laan (after a railway station) by Rizal, Plaridel by del Pilar, Taga-llog by Luna, Tikbalang by Mariano Ponce and Jomapa by Panganiban.     All of the members had one thing in common and that is that they were all liberals who were exiled in the year 1872. The La Solidaridad were also composed of students who attended universities in Europe. Their aim was to increase the awareness of the Spanish on the necessities of its colony in the Philippines. They also aimed to propagate smoother relationships between the Philippines and the Spanish if not closer. The La Solidaridad is a Spanish word which meant in English as the Solidarity. It was created on the 13th of December 1888 in Spain.      The organization was led by Galicano Apacible who was Jose Rizal’s cousin. La Solidaridad once issued a paper which had the same name. It was published on the 15th of February in 1889 at Barcelona, Spain. Graciano Lopez Jaena was the first editor of that paper and was later replaced by Marcelo H. del Pilar. The paper of La Solidaridad focused on nationalistic topics such as the political, cultural, social and economic conditions of a country specifically the Philippines and Spain. It contains articles and essays written by each prominent writer. Aside from that the paper also published articles concerning news and current events which are local and also foreign. They also included speeches coming from prominent leaders of Spain and which talked about the condition of the Philippines.     Aside from the first five mentioned, the other known members of La Solidaridad were Robert Lacamra, Jumar lim, Jose Alejandrino, Eduardo de Lete, Isabelo delos Reyes, Antonio Maria Regidor and Pedro Paterno. They also consisted of members which were foreign. The international members are the Austrian ethnologist Professor Blumentritt and Spanish Historian Dr. Miguel Sagrario.     The history of La Solidaridad take its roots back from the initial goals and aspirations of the Propaganda Movement. The Propaganda Movement in the past were looking for ways and venues to express their desires of the Philippines and Spain attaining a successful assimilation. They all then agreed that by creating the La Solidaridad they would be more effective in their mission and so it was established. The organization published their issues every after a week. It started its first publish in February 15, 1889. The La Solidaridad stood as one of the systems that helped the movement propagate for six years.     The Comite de Propaganda was the core provider and funder of the La Solidaridad. The editorship position was first offered to Jose Rizal which he declined. His reason was that it was due to his being so busy in the annotation of Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas by Antonio de Morga on London. From 1889 up to 1895 the La Solidaridad kept publishing. But after six years they ran out of funds to support their activities and on November 15, 1895, it officially ceased its publication with a farewell note from Marcelo del Pilar.
Remember the good all days when Nokia 3315 dominated the cellular brands available in the market? It has been the most popular and famous brand for cellular devices. Before mobile devices came in, it was first cellular devices and during that time Nokia has been occupying a great spot as the people’s number one choice.      However despite the popularity and the trusted reputation, Nokia faced a catastrophic event. During the release of mobile devices powered by android and ios, nokia wasn’t able to come up right away with their own version of android phone. Instead of getting along with the trend Nokia took the risk of partnering with Windows. The partnership gave birth to Nokia Lumia, also known as the Window’s Phone. Despite the name and the fresh approach, the new windows phone did not manage to attract more customers since it was launched. It was close to being failure since almost all users prefer using android devices rather than have it on windows.      For quite some time, Nokia remained silent about its attempt to match the release of android phones. Some people are even thinking what happened to this company. Nokia has indeed made a legacy. Now that the contract of the partnership between Nokia and Microsoft is finally over, Nokia is now launching its comeback with Nokia 6.     Last January 19, 2017 the company finally launched their mobile android device, the Nokia 6. Although this device will be launched exclusively in China as of the moment, people all over the world are very much excited for the comeback. But how excited should the people be with the specs of this new device?     Everybody should be excited because Nokia 6 has amazing specs that can be compared with Samsung and Apple’s most popular devices. Aside from the monster specs, people are very surprised to have it in a very affordable price. It is 70% cheaper compared to Apple’s Iphone 7 and Samsung’s S8. Just imagine having this kind of specs in a market price.     There is no wonder why it was sold out just a minute after its first launching in China. Although there are no reviews yet about this device people are positively anticipating that this is the thing that they have been waiting for. Everyone is wishing for this device to be available in their country or if not, Nokia will create a device that will be available all over the world.      There are also rumors that Nokia, in partnership with HMD Global will release two android mobile devices this year. And Nokia 6 is just the start of their comeback. The public are now waiting if Nokia will try to match the release date of Apple’s Iphone and Samsung’s S series. This will be an exciting year indeed. If you have plans of getting a new mobile device this year, you should watch out because a new competitive brand is going to make rounds for sure.
As simple and as straight forward as its use is, towels are a basic necessity for everyday life. But as important as they are, not a lot of people think to change them often. But because of the fact that we usually use these on a daily basis gives us all the more reason to swap them as soon as possible. The question is: how often is it safe enough to change towels? Here are a few factors: 1.    Number of Uses Think of washing your towel not in the number of days you’ve used it but in the number of times. The reason for this is because we differ in how many times a day or week we use it. Some of us like to do so daily; others every other day. Others still like to use their towels more than once, especially on a hot summer day. Recommended: Generally speaking, after 3-4 times, best if you throw in the towel, buddy. 2.    The Environment of Your Home Moisture – one of the essential components necessary for life. Good news for us who want to keep well-moisturized skin, but bad news for your towel. Moisture equals turning your beloved towel into an evil breeding ground for bacteria and all sorts of yuck. So if you live in a place that’s on the damp side, this means your towel will be facing the dryer more often than it likes. 3.    Where You Dry Off Your Towels Towels, though basically designed for heavy use, may start getting smelly if you don’t dry them off completely. It’s best to dry them outside and ideally, under direct sunlight to kill off those icky germs and deodorize the smell. But if you don’t want to go through the hassle and keep them inside, or you live in a place where you’re unable to put them outside, you may have to replace your towels more frequently. 4.    Your Health and Lifestyle For people who have sensitive skin and are prone to breakouts, a filthy bathroom towel could be your worst nightmare. When you rub this on your skin, the excess dirt and grime can clog your pores and result to a breakout of unsightly blemishes. Not only that, friction from rubbing can cause acne. The recommended way to use your towel is to pat your skin dry, don’t rub! For people who have an active lifestyle, whether you’re a gym buff or have a physically demanding job, sweat would most likely make your towel smell. The moment your nasal faculties alert you of even the slightest hint of a stench, replace that thing ASAP.

In a certain Facebook post by Mark Dianne Duarte, three women are now asking for help from anyone with a good heart to help them with their current situation. The victims are residents of Cabdbaran Agusan del Sur.      With the intent to enhance and beautify themselves, they decided to undergo treatment from a person whom they barely know. The procedure went by injecting some unknown chemicals unto their faces. However instead of having better and beautiful faces, it went really worse and appeared distorted. The three of them have the same reaction with the chemical.     With the help of their friends and families, they are now trying to reach a certain amount in order to help the victims. Aside from the horrible outcome of what happened, the victims are now starting to become ill and are all afraid of what could happen to them if not given the proper care.     Unfortunately, the suspect is now nowhere to be found. The victims were not even aware of the suspect’s whereabouts.     According to the one who posted, a certain media will then cover the story of these women, to inform and especially warn those who would dare to undergo such procedure. The suspect was not a licensed medical professional but because of cheaper rates he managed to convince these ladies to try it all for the aim of becoming beautiful.
When you don’t have sweet tooth it is hard to find snacks that can match your low tolerance for sugar. Almost all snacks were made out of sugar, chocolates and other forms of sweeteners. It is the main reason why Skittles stands out from the rest of the group. It is a sweet yet sour candy that comes in a bright rainbow colors. But all of a sudden Skittles became really dull and lost all that rainbow colors.     In an official stamen made by Skittles, they decided to have a different packaging for intended for the entire month of June. As practiced June is the month dedicated for the LGBT community. The LGBT community has the rainbow to represent them because they acknowledged that they are composed of different genders thus constitutes not just a single color but of different colors.      Since the Skittles and the LGBT community share the same kind of color representation, Skittles gladly gave way to the LGBT community. According to them, although the share the same symbol, one has to stand out and celebrate their existence and they give it whole heartedly to the LGBT group.      This is such a remarkable and thoughtful move for Skittles. Although they were branded and known because of their color, they were not afraid to give way to celebrate a significant event for some people. Consumers in return have shown appreciation to what the company did. Their customers admired their sensitive and immediate decision to honor the LGBT community.     Changing brand packaging is a bit risky when it comes to sales and market. Well known and established companies see to it that when they have to change or modify their packaging it needs to be somehow close to the previous design. It is because people shop out of familiarity. When you change your packaging into a totally different concept, chances are your consumers will not be able to recognize your products anymore.      However it is different with the case of Skittles. They dared to risk their sales and their brand in order to commemorate an event. With this making rounds in the internet, Skittles is rest assured that their customers would still remain loyal to them.
