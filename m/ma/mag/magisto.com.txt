Privacy Policy
Last Updated April 2016
Magisto is committed to respecting the privacy rights and concerns of all users of its Services. As such, we have established and implemented this Privacy Policy to inform visitors to the Site and users of the Services how we use and protect the information we collect through the Services. By accessing the Site or using any of the Services, you consent to Magisto’s collection, use, storage, deletion and disclosure of information relating to you as set forth in this Privacy Policy. If not specifically defined herein, capitalized terms have the meaning given to them in the Magisto Terms of Service, which are available at http://www.magisto.com/tos
What is Personal Information?
This Privacy Policy explains Magisto's policy regarding the collection, use, disclosure and protection of Personal Information. The terms of this privacy policy apply to information collected from you unless different terms are specified as part of a special offer or in another form or contract we provide you.
"Personal Information" is information that can be directly associated with a specific person or entity such as a customer's name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card number, or information about activities directly linked to that person, such as his or her purchases. Personal Information also includes information that you may choose to provide to us, such as your educational, medical and employment history profile. Personal information does not include “aggregate” information. Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of products, services or customers, from which individual customer identities have been removed. In other words, information about how you use a service may be collected and combined with information about how others use the same service, but no Personal Information will be included in the resulting data. Likewise, information about the products or services you use or purchase may be collected and combined with information about the products and services used or purchased by others, but no Personal Information will be included in the resulting data. Aggregate data helps understand trends and customer needs so that new products and services can be considered and so existing products and services can be tailored to customer desires.
Collection of Personal Information
We collect Personal Information that you provide us, such as when you
register to use the Services;
participate in other registration forms, feedback forms or surveys;
post or submit any content on the Site or Services, including any video or audio content; or contact us for any reason.
We may automatically collect some information when you use the Site or Services, such as your computer’s IP address, operating system, the site from which you linked to us, and the time and date of your visit, and activities. We also collect information received from third parties to the extent that they have entered into an agreement with you as a result of your relationship with Magisto.
Use of Personal Information
The personal information you provide to us will allow us to communicate with you and provide the Services to you, depending on the Services for which you register. This includes alerting you of new products or services, features, or enhancements to the Services; verifying your identity; handling your customer service questions or issues; requesting feedback; processing transactions; distributing newsletters; and notifying you of promotions, updates, or special offers that we think may interest you. We may also use your email address as part of the Services in sending you messages about the Services and other general announcements. We keep track of your interactions with us, including but not limited to your activity within the Services. Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, or unless we have your consent, we will not share your personal information with any person or entity other than those affiliated with us, entities acting on our behalf, and relevant third parties such as those needed to collect and maintain our information collection servers and perform technology and related services. We will also share the personal information we collect from you under the following circumstances:
Service Providers. We may share your personal information with service providers (including our affiliates that provide services on our behalf) that we engage for the purpose of processing information on our and your behalf. Additionally, we may partner with other companies to process, analyze, or store data. While providing services for us, these companies may access your personal information. To the extent applicable, we require these entities to comply with this Privacy Policy and appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
Protection of rights. We will share personal information if we have a good faith belief that (i) access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, such as a court order or subpoena, or a request by law enforcement or governmental authorities, (ii) such action is appropriate to enforce our Terms of Service, including any investigation of potential violations thereof, (iii) such action is necessary to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues associated with the Services, or (iv) such action is appropriate to protect the rights, property or safety of Magisto, its employees, users of the Services or others.
Asset transfers. If we become involved in a merger, acquisition or other transaction involving the sale of some or all of Magisto’s assets, user information, including personal information collected from you through your use of the Services, could be included in the transferred assets. Should such an event occur, we will use reasonable means to notify you through email or a prominent notice through the Services.
Videos
Summaries and edits of video produced by the Site and the Services will be made available to you via an internet link made available to you, including without limitation by email. If you reveal this link, send this email to third parties, or otherwise provide access to or distribute the videos, such third parties will have full access to such videos as well as any confidential or personal information on such videos. As such, you should have no expectation of confidentiality in videos or other material if you have revealed them to third parties.
All videos that you create and save using Magisto will be posted automatically to your timeline and be publicly available and searchable unless you choose otherwise. You may choose otherwise by selecting that a video be saved instead to your private album. If a video is made publicly available, you may later choose to make such video private. Notwithstanding such later choice, however, third parties may nevertheless continue to have access to your video via, for example, previously published links.
Videos that are publicly available may be posted and made available to the public on Magisto’s application. Magisto may recommend such videos to other end users or categorize such videos according to previously defined topics and interests. If your videos are made publicly available, you should have no expectation of privacy in such videos. If your videos are publicly available, and you include your videos in any Magisto promotion, Magisto may make copies of your videos available to its promotional partners for use in the context of that promotion.
Communities
If you use any of the features of the Site or Services, please remember that any information disclosed in these venues may be automatically made public, even without your knowledge or authorization. You should exercise caution when disclosing any information, including Personal Information, in such venues, as you do not know who will access or use such information and for what purposes. Magisto is in no way responsible for the accuracy, use or misuse of any information, including Personal Information, which you disclose in such venues.
Other Disclosures
In addition, we may disclose Personal Information in the good faith belief that we are required to do so by law, or that doing so is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process, cooperate with any requests of law enforcement or government security agencies, respond to any claims, or to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Magisto, our customers, or the public. Information about our customers, including Personal Information, may be disclosed as part of, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets or acquisition.
Protection of Personal Information
Magisto has put into place security measures in an effort to protect personal information from loss, misuse or alteration while it is under our control. Personal information we collect is stored electronically and may be combined with other membership information. We use technical, contractual, administrative and physical measures in an effort to protect against unauthorized access. Account information is accessible online only through the use of a password. To protect the confidentiality of personal information, you must keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person. If other people have access to your email, they may be able to obtain access to your password and obtain personal information about you (such as your credit card information), or change information about your user profile. You may not want to use an email account operated by an employer because many employers have the legal right to access such email accounts.

Magisto appreciates the importance of safeguarding the privacy of your Personal Information that may be provided to us.

Magisto may choose at its sole discretion to transfer, sell, provide or share such information with third parties, including for to Magisto's business partners for commercial purposes, and by providing any information to Magisto you consent to such provision of de-identified aggregate information to any third party. Magisto uses anonymous identifiers in order to allow Google to collect data in order that we may receive reports from Google with demographic and interest data regarding users of our mobile application, as well as general campaign metrics. Google also allows us to isolate and analyze subsets of sessions and users in such reports. Such reports and analyses are provided to us without the identifying information of specific users. These identifiers are used together with third party SDKs such as Google Analytics in order that we may receive such reports. Magisto does not merge this data with Personal Information.

Do Not Track
Some browsers incorporate “Do Not Track” features. Generally, such features when activated send a signal to web sites indicating that you do not wish to be tracked. “Do Not Track” is a standard that is under development, and there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret a “Do Not Track” signal and, as such, Magisto does not currently respond to the browser “Do Not Track” signals.
