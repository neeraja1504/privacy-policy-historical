We never sell or rent your email address to anyone. From time to time we may make our customer phone and postal mailing list available to other reputable organizations whose products or services we think you might find interesting. All MagazineLine.com customers are given the opportunity to opt-out of receiving these offers by calling our Customer Service department at (800) 959-1676 and requesting to opt-out of third party solicitations.

Purchasing subscriptions through MagazineLine.com is very safe. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
Safe Shopping
Our systems employ the latest encryption technology (Secure Socket Layers) to protect and safeguard your personal information. All of your ordering information, including name, address, and credit card number, is encrypted using a secure server for maximum security. Your credit card and personal information cannot be read as it travels to our ordering system. To ensure that your information is even more secure we store it on a server that is not connected to the Internet.
Credit Card Processing
Federal laws ensure that you will not be liable for more than $50 of fraudulent charges to your credit card. It is very unlikely that you would encounter fraud as a result of buying subscriptions through MagazineLine.com, but if you do, make sure to notify your card provider in accordance with their rules and policies. If for some reason you are held responsible for this amount, MagazineLine.com will cover the entire liability, up to $50, provided the fraudulent use of your credit card resulted through no fault of your own and occurred while purchasing through MagazineLine.com's secure server.
