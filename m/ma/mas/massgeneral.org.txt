We understand that health is a very personal, private subject, and we are committed to protecting the privacy and security of visitors to our site. This Privacy Policy will tell you what information we collect, how it is used, and what your choices are. Please read this policy carefully.

You may use most of the MGH site without providing any personal information.
Sometimes we do need information to provide services that you request.
When providing personal information via e-mail to the hospital, please remember that e-mail messages can be viewed by other Internet users while in transit.
If you have individualized information to communicate, please use the appropriate secure on-line form or contact the necessary party using traditional means such as phone or mail.

MGH currently discloses personal information you provide on the Web only to process credit card information or as required by law, and has no current plans to make other disclosures of such information. We will notify you through this on-line policy if there are any changes.
Requested information on voluntary forms is used to provide the services that you request, such as registration for classes, mailing of publications, and so forth.
MGH may occasionally provide statistics to third parties related to the number of visitors who use the site. These statistics do not provide personally identifiable information.
3. Does MGH use "cookies" to collect user information?
"Cookies" are small computer files that a web site can transfer to your computer. Examples of information we collect include how often someone visits our site and their activities while on our site. We use this information in the aggregate to understand how our visitors as a group use different resources. These reports do not contain any personally identifiable information.

MGH wants your personal information to remain as secure as possible. Accordingly, we prevent unauthorized access by a secure firewall and use of security infrastructure to protect the integrity and privacy of the personal information you provide to us. As an additional security measure, your personal information is also encrypted during transmission by Secure Socket Layer 128-bit encryption software. (Encryption is a common method used to transmit sensitive data across the Internet. Encryption temporarily makes the text unreadable during the time it is being transmitted over the Internet.)
Please note, that for encryption to work, your browser must be Netscape or Internet Explorer version 4.0 or higher.
