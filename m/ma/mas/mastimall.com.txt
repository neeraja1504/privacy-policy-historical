SAFETY AND SECURITY TIPS
Protect your passwords.
If using a public computer or terminal, always log out when you complete an online session.
Keep your passwords private. Remember, anybody who knows your password may access your account.
When creating a valid password, use letters and numbers only and it should be 6-15 characters long. –A combination of letters and numbers is best. Do not use dictionary words, your name, e-mail address, or other personal information that can be easily obtained. It is also recommended that you frequently change your password.
Avoid using the same password for multiple online accounts.
Be wary of unsolicited e-mail and telephone contacts.
Mastimall.com will never e-mail or call a customer and ask that they disclose or verify their Mastimall.com password, credit card, or banking account number. Such information should only be submitted on the web page forms, when completing an order on mastimall.com or when making updates to Your Account areas and never on phone or e-mail to us. If you receive a suspicious e-mail with a link to update your account information, do not click on the link--instead go directly to www.mastimall.com and then to your account.
If you are contacted by, or receive an unsolicited e-mail from an unknown entity impersonating as Mastimall.com or any of its sister concerns or associates, and are asked to confirm or provide your password or personal or banking information, simply disregard the request and report the incident to Mastimall.com for investigation.
Customers should always carefully review order and shipment confirmation e-mails to ensure that they are legitimate and have been sent by Mastimall.com. To do this, simply cross-reference confirmation e-mails with the transaction history found in your account area. If you receive shipment confirmation e-mail for a transaction you have not done, report the incident to Mastimall.com

If you receive an e-mail asking for personal details such as password never respond to it.
A phishing email will normally have a tone of urgency – like "Your account will be temporarily suspended" and therefore please "Login to keep your account active." Please remember Mastimall will NEVER send such emails to its customers.?
