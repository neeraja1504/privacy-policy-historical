Chapter 66, Section 10); (2) in the course of a law enforcement investigation; or (3) in the event of a suspected attempt to gain unauthorized access or to do physical damage (an attack by hackers, for example).
Web Server Activity Logs
Like most web servers on the Internet,massport.com servers collect and store all of the information that your web browser sends when it requests a web page including:
The name, domain and numerical address of the "host" computer (typically a computer belonging to your Internet Service Provider and not your personal computer) from which you access the Internet;
The date and time you accessed massport.com;
The Internet address of the web page you came from;
The page you requested and the amount of data sent to your computer; and
The information your web browser sends to massport.com, which typically identifies the browser software and may also indicate operating system and the type of CPU in your system.
It is impossible to determine the actual identity of an individual user from this information.
We develop summary reports, or logs, from the information collected. These logs are analyzed periodically in order to study site usage over time and to perform studies in order to improve the site's organization, performance and usefulness. The raw data used to develop these logs are erased periodically as a part of routine system maintenance.

We may forward your E-mail to other Massport employees or contract personnel who are better able to answer your question. The E-mail itself may be retained as required by Massachusetts Laws and regulations governing the retention of public records.
