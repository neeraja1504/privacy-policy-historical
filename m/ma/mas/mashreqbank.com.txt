Privacy Policy -Mashreq Bank
As your financial services partner, Mashreq understands that your trust in us is our most important asset. In order to preserve that trust, we want you to clearly understand what personal information we collect about you and how we use it. As a Mashreq customer, you have the opportunity to opt out from marketing communication lists or to specify your preferred channel of communication to receive notification of our latest offers and promotions.
To give you effective and convenient access to a broad range of financial products and services, we use technology to manage and maintain customer information.  We understand the need to safeguard sensitive information that you have entrusted to us. Therefore, we have put together a Privacy Policy that respects and addresses your needs. It also explains what types of information we collect and under what circumstances we may share it.

Protecting Information
Our Confidentiality and Security Safeguards
We maintain strict policies and security controls to assure that customer information in our computer systems and files is protected. Our employees and contractors are only permitted access to customer information that they may need to perform their jobs and to provide services to you. Our employees and contractors have access to such customer information as necessary to conduct a transaction or respond to your inquiries. All employees and contractors are required to respect customer privacy. No one except our employees and contractors has access to the Bank’s computer system and records storage. The Bank has established internal security controls, including physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect the information you provide to us and the information we collect about you. We will continue to review our internal security controls to safeguard your customer information as we employ new technology in the future.
Information Integrity Measures
Mashreq works hard to ensure that the customer information we maintain is complete and accurate. We have procedures and processes for updating our customer information as well as removing old, outdated information. We have measures in place to protect the integrity of customer information such as maintaining back-up copies of account data in the event of power outages or other business interruptions. We use computer virus detection and eradication software and employ other technical means (known as "firewalls") to protect against unauthorized computer entry into systems containing customer information.
