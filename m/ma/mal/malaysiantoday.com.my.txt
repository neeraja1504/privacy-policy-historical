Our Web servers do not automatically recognise specific information about individual users on our site. In addition, our servers do not automatically record information regarding a user's e-mail address unless the user supplies it.
We use cookies so that you don't have to re-enter your login information each time you visit our site.
We collect information about users during the registration process for certain parts of our site; through their participation in certain activities, including contests, forums, and polls; and through the use of cookies. When you request pages from our server, it automatically collects some information about your preferences, including your IP address. We use this to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our site.
The information collected is meant to identify the broad demographic profile of our users. This information does not contain anything that can identify users individually. We may combine demographic information supplied by a subscriber at registration with site usage data to provide profiles, in aggregate form, about our users and their preferences in the content of the site and advertising. You may receive periodic mailings from us with information on new products or services in our newspaper or on our site.
The user-supplied information collected through the registration process, surveys, contest entry forms, polls or other similar vehicles is used to improve the content of our site, or used for The Malaysian Today Press Sdn.

We may use such information for targeting appropriate editorial or advertising content to users but users will always be able to opt out of such mailings.

Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.
