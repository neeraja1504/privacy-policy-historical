Made Event, LLC ("Made Event") is concerned about your privacy and we provide this privacy notice ("Notice") to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information and data we receive from users of some of the websites we own and/or operate, namely http://www.madeevent.com , http://www.sundayschoolfestival.com, http://www.electriczoofestival.com, and http://www.electriczoo.mx ("Site") and the other services, features, content and applications offered by us on the Site ("Services"). This Notice applies only to information collected through the Site and Services.
By visiting this Site or using the Services, you are accepting the policies and practices described in this Notice, as such Notice may be amended from time to time. Each time you visit the Site or use the Services, you agree and expressly consent to our collection, use and disclosure of the information that you provide as described in this Notice.
To be clear about the terminology we are using, when we use the phrase "Personal Information" in this Notice, we mean information about you that is personally identifiable, like your name, address, e-mail address, billing information, and phone number, as well as other non-public information that is associated with this personal information. When we use the phrase "Anonymous Information" in this Notice, we mean information that is not personally identifiable, or linked to your Personal Information such as aggregated information, general demographic information and IP addresses. Anonymous Information does not necessarily enable identification of individual persons.
IF YOU ARE A USER ACCESSING THE SITE OR SERVICES FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION, ASIA, OR ANY OTHER REGION WITH LAWS OR REGULATIONS GOVERNING PERSONAL DATA COLLECTION, USE, AND DISCLOSURE THAT DIFFER FROM UNITED STATES LAWS, PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT THROUGH YOUR CONTINUED USE OF THE SITE AND SERVICES, WHICH ARE GOVERNED BY UNITED STATES LAW, THIS PRIVACY NOTICE, AND OUR TERMS OF USE, YOU MAY BE TRANSMITTING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO THE UNITED STATES AND YOU CONSENT TO THAT TRANSMISSION. ADDITIONALLY, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE TRANSMITTED TO AND PROCESSED IN COUNTRIES (INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES) WHERE LAWS REGARDING PROCESSING PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE LESS STRINGENT THAN THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION IN YOUR COUNTRY.
The Information We Gather
We collect information about you in a number of ways:
* We collect and maintain information that you voluntarily submit to us during your use of the Site and Services. For example:
* you may provide us with Personal Information in the course of email, text, use of customer support services or when you submit a post to a Forum; and
* if you purchase a product or service through the Site or one of the Services, we or a third party vendor may collect payment and/or credit card information on our behalf.
You may choose not to provide us with certain information, but this may stop you from gaining access to a Service or limit the features that you can use.
You may request data deletion. You may request that any Personal Information we receive from you be deleted from our database or that your wristband account be deleted. Please review the section below on Your Choices for further information.
As you use the Site and Services, certain information may also be passively collected. Through technologies like cookies, pixels, beacons and log files, we may collect information about how you use the Services. Please see the sections below on Cookies and Log Data for more information.
We may receive information from third parties. For example, we may receive Personal Information about you from social networking websites. In such a case, the third party will notify you that we will have access to your information and the governing privacy policy.

First, we may utilize persistent cookies to save your registration information. Second, we utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Services, to better understand how you interact with the Services and to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on the Site and Services. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Site and then close your browser.

How We Share and Disclose Information
We know how important it is to keep your information confidential. We will not rent, sell or share your Personal Information with third parties except as specifically approved or under the circumstances described below. If you do not want us to use or disclose Personal Information collected about you in the ways identified in this Notice, you may choose not to provide your Personal Information or you may choose not to use the Site or Services.
Users. Any information you choose to share should reflect how much you want Made Event, other users, and third parties to know about you. We recommend that you guard your anonymity and Personal Information and we encourage you to think carefully about what Personal Information you disclose through these platforms.
Service Providers. We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate or enhance our Site or Services, to provide the Services on our behalf, to perform tasks (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database management, web analytics and improvement of the Site or Services) or to assist us in analyzing how our Services are used. These third parties have access to your Personal Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose it or use it for any other purposes.
Sponsors. We may collect Personal Information about you and share it with third parties to the extent that you give us permission at the time of collection. For example, we sometimes gather Personal Information that is then shared with a sponsor of an event. In such a case, we will provide you with notice at the time of collection that the information will be shared with the sponsor and link to the sponsor's privacy policy.
Affiliate Site or Service. When you access a website or communicate with or use an application (mobile or otherwise) operated by any entity other than us (e.g., the iTunes App Store), a social networking site such as Facebook or Twitter, or one of our sponsors, venues or promoters) through our Site, the website or service is known as an Affiliate Site or Service. Unless we clearly indicate otherwise at the time of collection, we do not share Personal Information with Affiliate Sites or Services. Your use of the Affiliate Sites and Services is your choice, and you should be aware that our Affiliate Sites and Services may collect information about you. Accordingly, if you use an Affiliate Site or Service, you should consult that Affiliate's privacy policy before providing Personal Information. Some of our Affiliates, may create "co-branded pages" or "powered by" pages for our Services. These might include pages that share our name and that of another entity. There may be a specific privacy policy on any such co-branded page. Any Personal Information that you provide when you sign up at any co-branded page may be collected by, or shared with, our third party Affiliate. Please see the Affiliate Site's privacy policy to better understand what information is collected, how it is used and shared, and your choices regarding control.
Aggregated, Anonymous Information. Aggregated Anonymous Information is the combination of your Anonymous Information with the Anonymous Information of other users. Aggregated Anonymous Information does not allow you to be identified or contacted. We may share such Aggregated Anonymous Information with third parties, and, depending on the circumstances, we may or may not charge third parties for such information, or limit the third parties' use of the same.
Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we in good faith believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to comply with applicable laws, to protect the property and rights of Made Event, you or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to pose a risk of being, or is illegal, unethical or legally actionable.
Within our Company; Changes to our Company. We may share all or some of your Personal Information with any of our subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control, in which case we will require them to honor this Notice.

You acknowledge that such transfers may occur and are permitted by this Notice, and that any entity that acquires us, is merged with us or that acquires our assets may continue to process your Personal Information as set forth in this Notice.
Online Surveys/Sweepstakes and Contests. From time to time, we conduct online surveys and offer sweepstakes or contests on the Site (each, a "Promotion"), and we may collect Personal Information in connection with the same. We may use your Personal Information to contact you regarding your Promotion entry, or to contact you if you win a Promotion (if applicable). You should carefully review the rules, if any, of each Promotion in which you participate through the Site, as they may contain additional important information about the use of your Personal Information.
