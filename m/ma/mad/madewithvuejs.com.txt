Privacy Statement - Made with Vue.js
At A Glance
Who is responsible for the collection of data on madewithvuejs.com?
Nifty Software e.U. is responsible for the data collection and storage. Our contact data can be found in the Imprint.
How do we collect your data?
Primarily we collect data that you consciously give to us, f.ex. with subscribing to our newsletter, by sending us an e-mail to get your project added or by booking a package to feature your project.
Other data will be automatically collected when you visit madewithvuejs.com. These are mainly technical data like your browser, OS or the time of your visit. This happens automatically and helps us to see how we can improve our site. These data will never be linked to your personal data (like f.ex. your e-mail address that you gave us when subscribing to our newsletter). We can not (and do not want to) create a profile of you and your browsing habits.
To keep madewithvuejs.com alive, we also use Affiliate & Ad Services, that may store the timestamp of your visit, your IP-address and a cookie.
How do we use your data?
We use statistics to further develop our website and to make sure to be able to deliver it without issue. Your e-mail address will only be used to answer your questions, send you our newsletter (if you consciously signed up for it). Your personal and company data will only be used to create an invoice for purchased feature packages or provide the purchased services.
Some data will be processed by Third Parties. This is limited to our Newsletter Provider MailChimp (see 2 below), the tools we use to handle the purchase of feature packages (TypeForm and Stripe, see 1 below) and our Webspace Provider (Digital Ocean, see 1 below). We only share necessary data to provide a specific service with those parties (f.ex. only your e-mail address to send you a newsletter).
We will not share your data with any other third parties and we won't use it for anything else ourselves. If you personally write us an e-mail, your address will be handled only by us, confidentially.
What are your rights?
You have the right to request information about origin, recipients and purpose of your data free of charge at any time. You can demand correction, locking or deletion of your data – just send us an informal e-mail.
In case we don’t comply with your request, you have the right to complain at the responsible regulating authority. Of course, it’s in our interest to guarantee your personal data privacy. If you have any questions please feel free to contact us.

The e-mail addresses of our newsletter subscribers, as well as the data collected as described above, will be stored on the servers of MailChimp in the USA. MailChimp is using this information to distribute and analyze our newsletters according to our orders. In addition, MailChimp is authorized to use our data to optimize and improve their services, f.ex. for the technical optimization of the distribution of newsletters.

The newsletter issues contain a so-called „web-beacon“, which is a pixel-sized file that will be called by MailChimp’s servers upon opening the newsletter. Through this beacon, technical data like your browser and OS, as well as your IP address and the timestamp of you opening the newsletter can be accessed and stored by MailChimp. This information is used for the optimization and improvement of the service.
These data also include whether the newsletter has been opened, when it has been opened and which links got clicked. This information can be linked to the personal data of our subscribers for technical reasons, although it is not in our interest, nor in the interest of MailChimp to observe or analyze individual users. These statistics are used to gain insights into the preferences of our subscribers to provide them with content that is useful to them.
