MailStreet takes your privacy very seriously.  Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy.
What This Privacy Policy Is About
This policy will tell you how MailStreet handles personal information that MailStreet collects and receives, including information related to your usage, both past and present, of MailStreet products and services, including MailStreet. Personal information can be defined as information about you including your name, company name, address, email address, and/or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available.
This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that MailStreet does not own or manage, or to individuals that MailStreet does not employ, instruct, or manage.
Information Collection and Use
MailStreet collects information when you register with MailStreet and/or MailStreet, when you use MailStreet products or services, and when you browse/visit MailStreet pages.
Upon registering, we ask for your name, email address, zip code. Once you have done this and sign in to our services, you are no longer anonymous to MailStreet.
MailStreet automatically receives and records information in our servers and on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, MailStreet cookie information, and the specific page you request. This information is not shared with any 3rd parties and is used only for internal technical and sales-tracking purposes.
Information Sharing and Disclosure
MailStreet does not rent, sell, auction-off, or share any personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies or entities, with the following exceptions:
We have written permission to do so, or receive “electronic permission” via email or instant messaging, to do so.
Occasionally, MailStreet will seek testimonials from satisfied customers to serve as advertising for our services. This information will only be gathered with permission to do so, or when volunteered, or when MailStreet receives “electronic permission”, via email or instant-messaging, to do so.
We will respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.
If required by law or license agreement to do so.
We find it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of MailStreet's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.
We transfer information about you if MailStreet is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, MailStreet will notify you before any information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Cookies
MailStreet may set and access MailStreet cookies on your computer.
Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Other companies do not have access to MailStreet's cookies.
