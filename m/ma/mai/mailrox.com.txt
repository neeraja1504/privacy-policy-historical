Movable Ink May Disclose Your Information
We may disclose to non-affiliated third parties the information we collect as follows:
Our Clients. As part of our Service, we may combine and provide to our clients information that we collect through a client's website, email campaigns, and directly from the client and partners. For example, we provide reports to help clients improve their email marketing campaigns and websites by learning more about the consumers who receive their emails and visit their websites.
Service Providers. In order to provide our Services, we may share your information with third parties who perform services for us, with us, or on our behalf, including without limitation providers of technical infrastructure and support and delivery of email, and third parties who deliver advertisements about our products or events.
As Required By Law and Similar Disclosures. We may access, preserve, and disclose your information and content if we believe doing so is required by law or if those actions are reasonably necessary to:
comply with legal process, such as a court order or subpoena or respond to a government request, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements;
enforce this Policy or our Terms of Service;
respond to your requests for customer service;
respond to law enforcement;
investigate and prevent illegal activities; or
protect our or others' rights, property, or personal safety.

We do not guarantee that any entity receiving such information in connection with one of these activities will comply with all terms of this Policy.
Analytics and Do-Not-Track
Online Analytics Providers
To help us better understand your use of the Services, we may use third-party analytics such as those of Google Analytics, and others. These third parties use the sorts of technologies described in the “Information that is Passively or Automatically Collected Information” section above to help us analyze how our users and our client's end users use the Services. The information (including your IP address) collected by the technology will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of the Services and share that information with us and our clients. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on by clicking here.
Browser-based “Do Not Track”
Some browsers incorporate a “Do Not Track” (DNT) feature that, when turned on, signals to websites and online services that you do not want to be tracked. Because there is not yet an accepted standard for how to respond to browser DNT signals, we do not currently respond to them.
Security Of Your Information
We take steps to ensure that your information and the email distribution lists of our clients are treated securely and in accordance with this Policy. Unfortunately, as with any platform that collects or stores data, neither the Internet or any security protocols can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information we collect.
