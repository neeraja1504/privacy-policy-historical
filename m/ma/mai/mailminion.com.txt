When we send emails to registered Mail Minion customers, we'll sometimes track who opened the emails and who clicked the links.

We also include Web Beacons in the emails we deliver for you. We use the data from those Web Beacons to create the reports you see about who has or hasn’t opened emails or clicked links. Reports are also available to us when we send you email, so we may collect and review that information.
We may get more information about you, like name, age, and participation in social media websites, by searching the internet or querying third parties. We only collect data that’s publicly available or provided by a third party according to its terms of use.
