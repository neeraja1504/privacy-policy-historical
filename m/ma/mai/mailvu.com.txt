We may, from time to time, send you emails regarding our services and products. Only mailVU.com will
send you these direct mailings.
Testimonials posted on our web site are only placed with the expressed permission of the individual
or company who provided that testimonial.
We may use cookies, web beacons, and logging information to a) store information so you don't have to
retype it, b) provide custom, personalized content and information, c) monitor the effectiveness of our
marketing campaigns, d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors and page views, and
e) track your entries, submissions, and status in promotions, sweepstakes, and contests.
We may allow advertising companies or ad networks to display advertisements on our website. We do
not provide any personal information to these companies. Cookies and/or web beacons may be placed by
third party service providers to help determine the effectiveness of advertising campaigns or email
communications. You should visit those service provider's web pages to review their privacy policies. We
prohibit web beacons from being used by third parties to collect or access your personally
identifiable information.
Sharing Information with 3rd Parties
We will not rent or sell your personal information to any other company or individual without your consent,
except as we are required by law, or if disclosure of information is necessary to protect A2Stream, the
mailVU.com users, or the general public. We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any
activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful.
You may provide certain Personally Identifiable Information to us regarding third parties. For instance when
you share Private links with others you may provide and we collect the email addresses of the people with
whom you want to share your video and resume. We will not sell or rent Personally Identifiable Information
to others, nor disclose the information to others except to the extent necessary to fulfill your service request,
to protect ourselves from liability, to respond to a court order or subpoena, or in connection with a merger,
acquisition, or liquidation of the company.
A2Stream may retain service providers to assist us with marketing, communications, and customer service
initiatives. These providers could include providers of customer support, email service providers, automated
data providers, and shipping agents. Suppliers and service providers are required by contract to keep
confidential the information received on behalf of A2Stream and may not use it for any purpose other than to
carry out the services they are performing for A2Stream.
Non account holders may view your mail if you designated them as recipients.
We do not store your credit card or other payment information on our site. Payment for services are made
through one of our online transaction partners: PayPal or Intuit. Please refer to their privacy policies.
We may share with third parties non-personal, aggregated information, such as demographic and profile
data of the user community at large.
Your Choice in Selecting Privacy Settings
Every account holder is provided with a My Account section in the mailVU service. It is the responsibility of
each user to ensure the information is correct and current. Users are responsible for the accuracy of their
account Preferences. You may update or correct these selections as any time by logging into your account
and making the changes on the My Account page. You may also leave the optional information fields blank.
A mailVU account holder cannot opt-out of communications primarily for the purpose of administering order
completion, support, software warnings and updates, or other administrative and transactional notices as
the primary purpose of these communications is not promotional in nature.
The user must specify the deletion time period of each multimedia mail. The files will be deleted from the
A2Stream servers at the earlier of the user defined date/views, or the time frame associated with
your account type.
Access to and Accuracy of Your Information
The mailVU.com site is designed to be accessible 24x7 every day of the year unless down for system
maintenance. To protect your privacy and security on accounts, we will take reasonable steps to verify
your identity, such as requiring username and password, before granting access to the data. To view
and modify your personal information you may edit the selections in the My Account area of the service.
Keeping Your Personal information Secure
A2Stream takes seriously the trust you place in us. We will keep your private data secure consistent
with current industry standards. To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, to maintain data accuracy,
and to ensure the appropriate use of the information, A2Stream utilizes appropriate physical, technical,
and administrative procedures to safeguard the information we collect.
Personal information, once transmitted to us, will be stored on computers that only selected personnel
and contractors have access to via password. These computer systems are located in controlled facilities
which have limited access. Your mail messages are limited-access, where access is gained through an
obscured URL system. This obscured URL makes it difficult if not impossible for a third party to guess the
URL address of your content without an invitation from you including the relevant URL. However, unless
the videos and content are password protected, your invitees may forward the URL link to other parties and
a possibility exists that an unauthorized third party could discover your videos and/or content.
Changes to This Policy
We may occasionally update our Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices and services. When we do,
we will also revise the Update date located at the beginning of this Policy. We encourage you to periodically
review this Policy and become aware of modifications. If we make material changes in the way we collect, use,
or share your personal information, we will notify you for sending an email to the email address you most
recently provided to us and/or by prominently posting notice of the changes on our website. Your continued use
of the mailVU.com site constitutes your agreement to this Policy and any updates.
