Privacy Policy - MainAd
MainAd is the trading name of mainADV S.R.L and is firmly committed to protect the privacy of Internet users as well as to foster user confidence in the Internet, online advertising and direct marketing.
We continuously evaluate innovative ways to protect online user privacy while also offering our clients the ability to own and use information regarding interactions with their customers.
The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to provide users with clear and complete notification about the user information we collect in connection with our services and corporate website.
– Information We Collect Through our Services
We do not collect PII.
We do not collect the online user’s personally identifiable information (“PII”) through our services. PII generally refers to information such as an individual’s name, mailing address, phone number or e-mail address.
Non-Personal Information Collected by our Services
We offer a wide range of services that allow advertisers and publishers to show online users the most useful and relevant ads online.
We may collect non-personally identifiable information (“Non-PII”) regarding the user’s behavior and usage patterns on advertisements and sites operated by our clients to better customize the type of advertisements users see on various sites.
Non-PII may include information such as the type of Internet browser used by an online user, the type of computer operating system used, the domain name of the website visited, as well as information related to websites and web pages a user is viewing when an advertisement is shown.
We collect Non-PII through the use of cookies and pixels. No personally identifiable information is collected or used in this process. A cookie is a file placed on certain pages that uniquely identifies your browser. A pixel is a line of code which is used by a website or third party ad server to track a user’s activity.
The use of a pixel allows us to record information when a user has visited a particular webpage along with the additional Non-PII that the website publisher or advertiser may choose to include with the pixel.
We encourage you to always read the privacy policies of the websites you visit to understand the issues relating to your online privacy.
The use of cookies by our affiliates, service providers or tracking utility company is not covered by our Privacy Policy.
We do not have access or control over these cookies. Third parties use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate through our site.
– Disclosure of Information to Third Parties
We do not collect PII via our services; therefore, we do not sell, rent, or share PII collected on our customer’s websites to affiliated or non-affiliated third parties.
We may disclose Non-PII collected through our services and information derived from it, to our customers. This Non-PII may be used by our customers to deliver tailored ads to users on participating websites. We shall not use this information to contact or identify any person individually. Furthermore, all of our customers have warranted that they shall use any Non-PII they receive in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but we shall not be responsible for any breach of any such warranty by customers.
We may disclose a user’s information to the competent authorities when we reasonably believe that we are obligated by law to do so, and in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual prohibited activities, including, but not limited to fraud as well as situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person. Furthermore, we may disclose a user’s information in order to establish, exercise, or defend our legal rights for the purposes of fraud prevention and reducing credit risk.
