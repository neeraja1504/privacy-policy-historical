How we use personal information
HHPL is a data controller in respect of all information we collect and receive about you when you use our services. We have put in place a set of information guidelines that serve as the basis for our customer and advertiser relationships. These guidelines have been developed to comply with the Data Protection Act 1998 and the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003. We will also, from time to time, act on advice published by the Information Commissioner.
Highwood House Publishing Limited is registered as required under the Data Protection Act 1998, registration number Z960527X. If you require information on the Data Protection Act 1998, the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 or the Information Commissioner you can visit www.dataprotection.gov.uk.
The following measures are taken by HHPL to protect our users’ privacy:-
We do not provide or sell your details to advertisers or third parties. In the case of any offers made to you these offers will only come from HHPL.
HHPL and our group of companies may contact you by post or telephone with details of their products, services and promotions. In the case of e-mail this correspondence will be sent to all users excepting those who have specifically opted out of receiving communications via these methods.
All e-mail correspondence that you receive will include an unsubscribe option.
We reserve the right to disclose information about member usage and demographics to advertisers and partners, but this will only be in anonymous aggregate format. HHPL will not reveal your personal identity in connection with the disclosure of such information.
What Personally Identifiable Information Is Collected About You?
Information is collected on our users in two ways: through the use of cookies and through registration. For more information about cookies please see below.
We may require users to provide us with a name, e-mail address, postal address, postcode, gender and date of birth in order to register for access to certain services. We may also ask for other non-mandatory demographic information from subscribers.
Following registration we will employ a registration cookie to recognise a subscriber and his or her access privileges on www.maturetimes.co.uk as well as to track site usage.
We will also collect personal information from you through your use of enquiry and feedback forms and every time you e-mail us your details. We will only collect such information when you choose to supply it to us.
We will also log IP addresses, or the location of your computer on the internet, for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes. We occasionally use IP addresses to track a user’s session, but do not link IP addresses to personally identifiable information.
For your information, an IP address is a number assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider (ISP), so you can access the internet. An IP address is generally considered to be non-personally identifiable information, because in most cases an IP address is dynamic (i.e. it changes each time you connect to the internet), rather than static (i.e. unique to a particular user’s computer).
What Do We Do With The Information We Collect?
We may use the information we collect to perform statistical analyses of user behaviour in order to measure relative consumer interest in the various areas of our site (to improve our site) and to inform advertisers as to how many consumers have seen their advertising content. In performing these statistical analyses, we will disclose information to third parties only in aggregate form. Personal information on individual subscribers will not be provided to third parties.
Our website also contains links to websites owned and operated by third parties. The third party companies are responsible for ensuring their websites adhere to their own privacy policies, including the use of cookies. We do not take any responsibility or liability for the practices of these third parties.
We may periodically send you e-mail updates on www.maturetimes.co.uk and services offered by www.maturetimes.co.uk and its advertisers. All users will receive these communications via e-mail unless they have specifically opted not to receive these communications. If you wish to opt out of receiving such information from us, then please use the unsubscribe option included in all our e-mail correspondence or send an e-mail to unsubscribe@maturetimes.co.uk stating that you would prefer not to receive such mailings.
We will use files generated by our web servers to analyse site usage and statistics but the files do not identify any personal information. Files analysis helps us to understand usage patterns on our website and to make improvements to our service.
‘Third Party’ Advertising Cookies
Most of the advertisements that you will see on www.maturetimes.co.uk are generated by third parties. Some of these third parties will generate their own cookies to track how many people have seen a particular advertisement (or use the services of third parties to do this), and to track how many people have seen it more than once. These cookies cannot be used to identify an individual; they can only be used for statistical purposes, for example, in providing you with advertisements that are more relevant to your interests. Some of the information gleaned from third party cookies will be aggregated with other anonymous information for statistical purposes. The third party companies that generate these cookies have their own, very strict, privacy policies but we don’t have access to these cookies; other than allowing them to be served, we have no role to play in these cookies at all (although we may use statistical information arising from these third party cookies and provided to us by third parties, to improve the targeting of advertisements to users of www.maturetimes.co.uk.
If you would like to disable these ‘third party’ cookies generated by advertisers or providers of targeted advertising services, you can turn them off by going to the third party’s website and getting them to generate a one-time “no-thanks” cookie that will stop any further cookies being served to your machine.
With Whom Do We Share The Information We Collect?
We do not sell your personal information to others. However, in the legitimate course of our business we may be asked to provide aggregate statistics on our customers, sales, traffic patterns and related site information to reputable third-party vendors. However, any information so provided will include no personally identifying information.
The Option to Opt Out

Third parties
There are certain circumstances under which we may disclose your personal information to third parties. These are as follows:
