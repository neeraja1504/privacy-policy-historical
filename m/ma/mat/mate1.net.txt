Mate1.com - Find Someone Today
Our mission at Mate1.com is to provide a secure meeting place where members can connect privately and anonymously. It is up to you to decide if and when to reveal your identity to another member or to meet in person. We believe that the web can be the safest and most sensible place to meet new people with a view to embarking on relationships of any kind, so long as the site operators and site members cooperate to keep it that way.
Our primary concerns in drafting this Privacy Policy were our members' peace of mind and security. The practices outlined below represent our best efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information while also protecting your interests and the collective interests of Mate1.com and its members. This privacy policy was last revised on January 11, 2011. Each time you visit this web site or provide us with any information, you are implicitly accepting the practices described in this privacy policy at that time. We reserve the right to change this policy at any time, without notice provided that such changes only apply to information gathered on or after the date of such change. In the event that we do decide to make material changes regarding how we use personal information previously collected, you will be notified of such changes by email or by a prominent notice on our website. If you have suggestions as to how we might improve this policy, or any aspect of this site, please contact us here or at privacy@mate1.com.

Information requested from visitors
When you register to use any Mate 1 Services you will be asked for some general identifying information which will enable us to provide you with this individualized service. We gather contact information (like your email address) and demographic information (like your city of residence, gender and age). We may share some of this information with our professional advisors, consultants, third party associates, partner sites, and in the event that any part of Mate1 is merged with or purchased by another company. In the event of a merger or a purchase, we will notify you by email before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy, and we will provide you with the opportunity to opt out of the transfer of your data before it takes place.
Public and Private Information
Public information is information that you enter into the Mate1 database that can be viewed by visitors to the site and occasionally in promotional materials. During the registration process, you will be asked to create a "Mini Profile." The Mini Profile consists of personal but non-identifying information (i.e. your civil status, height, body type, ethnicity, religion, personal habits, etc). Once you are a registered member of the site, you will have the option of adding further text, photos and a voice recording. This Public information, collectively known within the site as your "Profile," is not linked to your personal identification in any way that can be seen by other users of the site, unless you include personally identifying information in the portions of your profile that you type yourself. Moreover, if you provide us with a photograph of yourself, your Profile may become personally identifiable.
Private information is information that can personally identify you, such as your real name, email address or credit card number. When you register to use any Mate 1 service, you will be asked for some general identifying information to enable us to provide you with this individualized service. We gather contact information (such as your email address) and, if you choose to sign up for a Full Membership or to purchase credits, financial information (such as your credit card number and expiry date).
Financial and Billing Information
If you choose to become a Full Member, we may collect financial information (like your credit card number and expiry date or your checking account number) and your billing address. Financial information is gathered and processed through our own secure server or through a third-party billing site, and encrypted via a secure server to ensure that others cannot read it. You will know you are in secure mode when the tiny padlock icon - located at the bottom right of your browser - appears "locked". We will only use your financial information in the course of providing our Services to you. The specific financial information we collect is not rented, sold, or shared with any third party apart from the financial institution that processes your transaction, except under the following special conditions: where we determine that such disclosure is required by law; to cooperate with law enforcement; in the event of a merger or a transfer of ownership or of assets; to subsidiary and parent companies and businesses, and other affiliated legal entities and businesses with whom we are under common corporate control. In the event of a merger or a transfer of ownership of Mate1 to another company, you will be notified by email in advance and provided with an opportunity to remove your information prior to the merger or transfer.
