Matrox - Cookie setting
At Matrox, ensuring the privacy of our Web site visitors is an important concern. We will not collect any personal information about our Web site visitors unless it is submitted voluntarily, in which case we will act in a responsible manner to protect your personal information. The privacy practices described in this document (the “Privacy Policy”) apply to Personally Identifiable Information (as defined below) that we collect in connection with all products, services and website(s) (collectively, “the Site”) offered by Matrox Electronic Systems LTD, Matrox Graphics Inc. and its affiliates and subsidiaries (collectively “Matrox”). By visiting the Site you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use or access the Site. We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy without prior notice. Any changes to our Privacy Policy will become effective upon our posting of the revised Policy on the Site. Use of the Site following such changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy then in effect.
This Privacy Policy describes the Personally Identifiable Information we collect about you and how we may use and/or disclose that Personally Identifiable Information.
Personally Identifiable Information
"Personally Identifiable Information" (or "PII") is information that identifies you as an individual or from which you can be identified. Matrox may collect Personally Identifiable Information in a number of ways, but the two most common are during Site registration or Site personalization and product or service registration or enrollment. In some instances, you may visit the Site and use some of our services without providing PII to us. The PII requested may vary depending on which product, service or Site you are using or accessing. We typically ask for PII about you, such as your name, e-mail address, postal address, telephone numbers and fax numbers. We may also ask for financial information, such as account or credit card number to verify your user identity and to allow you to pay for any purchases you make. In addition to the PII we obtain at the initial stage of registration, we may ask you for PII at other times, such as when you make a purchase or use a service on the Site; when you participate in a contest, survey, or promotion; or when you report a problem with the Site or one of our services. In most cases, the more specific information you provide, the better we are able to personalize your experience with Matrox.

Additionally, we may use your PII to ensure that you are directed to the right Site, product and/or service for you.
Communications: If you sign up, we may use PII about you to provide you with information about products or services offered by Matrox, to recommend Matrox products and services and to enable you to take advantage of the many features they offer. If you later change your mind and no longer wish to receive such marketing communications from us, you may opt-out of such communications on a going-forward basis as set forth below.

With whom does Matrox share PII?
Our Business Partners, Strategic Alliance Companies: If you submit PII to purchase a product or service from a partner or a company with which we have a relationship, we will need to share that PII with the relevant partner/company so that Matrox or the partner/company can process your order(s) to ship, supply, maintain, renew or service the products or services that you requested and you may be contacted by the partner/company for any of these purposes. We shall require that any such partner or company comply with the provisions of this Privacy Policy in dealing with any PII we share with them. MATROX IS NOT RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR THE USE OF PII ABOUT YOU BY SUCH PARTNERS, COMPANIES AND/OR RESELLERS.
Marketing Relationships: If you opt-in, we may share your PII with third parties such as our affiliates, resellers, distributors and agents so that they can provide you with information about their products and services. If you do not want your PII shared with such third parties for marketing purposes, you may opt-out of such sharing as described in the Section entitled “Your choices regarding the use of PII” below.
Special Cases: Matrox may also use and/or disclose PII in other special cases when we have reason to believe that using and/or disclosing this PII is necessary to identify, contact, or if Matrox deems necessary, bring legal action (including action outside your country of residence) against someone who may be violating Matrox's Terms of Service, end user license agreements and/or intellectual property rights. The same policy applies in cases where we believe an individual may be causing injury to or interfering with (either intentionally or unintentionally) Matrox's rights or property, other users of an Matrox Site or service, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. Matrox may disclose or access PII when we believe in good faith that the law (including laws outside your country of residence) requires it, to comply with legal process, to respond to requests from public authorities including public authorities outside your country of residence, to protect our operations and to permit us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain. This includes exchanging PII with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
Service Providers: We occasionally employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive PII from customer lists, ensuring accuracy of PII, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, fulfilling purchases and processing credit card payments. We may share PII about you with third parties for the purpose of enabling these third parties to perform such functions.
Third Party websites: Matrox’s Web sites may contain links to other Web sites.
Assignment: As we continue to develop and expand our products and services, we may sell or buy businesses or product or service lines. In such transactions, customer PII is generally one of the assets transferred. As such, we reserve the right to transfer any and all information that we collect from Site users to a third party in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of Matrox’s business, assets or stock (including without limitation in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings). In addition, in connection with any such transaction, we reserve the right to share PII about you with our consultants and advisors (such as accountants and lawyers).
Your choices regarding the use of PII
We will normally ask you if you want to receive marketing information from us, or from our affiliated companies or other companies we will identify to you. If you do not want to receive that information, be sure to indicate that when you are asked to specify your choices.
In addition, if you change your mind, and no longer wish to receive marketing information from us on a going-forward basis, or if you would prefer that we do not share PII about you on a going-forward basis with our affiliates and/or with our partners for such affiliates’ and/or partners’ marketing purposes, you may opt-out of receiving such marketing-related information and/or from such sharing by submitting a request to change your communication preferences at:
