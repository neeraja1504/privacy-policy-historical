Are Cookies/Online Tracking Used On This Site?
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's device tied to information about the user. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. If users reject the cookie, they may still use our site. Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. We do not respond to browser do-not-track signals at this time.
Are Other Tracking Technologies Used on This Site?
Technologies such as cookies, web beacons (also known as pixel tags), or similar technologies are used by AIG Direct and our partners (such as DoubleClick and TradeDesk for paid advertising), affiliates, or analytics or service providers (such as Adobe Site Catalyst and Google Analytics for site performance metrics and LivePerson for online chat functionality). These technologies are industry standards and are used in analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users' movements around the site and to gather demographic and other information about our users individually and about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.
We partner with one or more third parties to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partners may use technologies such as cookies and web beacons to gather information about your activities on this site and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may optout by clicking here or by visiting the self-regulatory program opt-out page at www.aboutads.info/choices to opt out in desktop and mobile web browsers on the particular device from which you access the opt-out options. Download the AppChoices app at www.aboutads.info/appchoices to opt out in mobile applications. Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads. You will continue to receive generic ads. In addition, such a third party may pool the other information that they collect with other sources of information not collected during your visit to our website, which may include your name and mailing address, to permit you to receive mailings from us or them, and for other purposes. If you do not wish for cookies or web beacons to be placed on your computer, most commercially-available web browsers permit you to prevent that from taking place.
As is true of most Web sites, we use third party tracking partners to gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
Our website may also use a website recording service which may record mouse clicks, mouse movements, page scrolling and text keyed into website forms, not including personal information. Data collected by this service is used to improve our website usability. The information collected is stored and is used for aggregated and statistical reporting, and is not shared with anybody else.
How Is Information Used for Customer Reviews?
We may provide you the opportunity to participate in reviews conducted via email. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these reviews is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code).
We use this information to evaluate our level of customer service. With your consent we may post your reviews on our Web site along with your name. If you want your review removed please contact us at Client.Services@aigdirect.com.
We use a third party service provider to conduct these reviews; that company is prohibited from using our users' personally identifiable information for any other purpose. We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a review with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.
Is this Web Site Secure?
This Web site takes precaution to protect our users' information. Access to users' information is restricted in our offices, and we follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, an agent or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every year, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our users' information is protected. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment in a locked facility. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about the security at our Web site, send an email to Client.Services@aigdirect.com.
