PERSONAL INFORMATION
Math Playground does not collect or solicit any personally identifiable information from children or students. There are no contests or chat features on Math Playground. We do provide an option for educators to subscribe to our newsletter in a clearly labeled teacher's section of Math Playground. The newsletter is further separated from the rest of the site by an age-gate.
We enable users to purchase a “for-pay” subscription account on Math Playground. We use Stripe for payment and subscription management services. On pages related to payments, Stripe collects identifying information about the devices that connect to its services. Stripe uses this information to operate and improve the services it provides to us, including for fraud detection. You can learn more about Stripe and read its privacy policy at https://stripe.com/privacy.
ADVERTISING
Ads that appear on Math Playground come from our advertising partner, Playwire Media. Playwire offers a kidSAFE COPPA-certified service for publishers of child-directed websites. While many of the ads are directly bought from the brands advertised, Playwire also uses carefully screened, 3rd party ad networks. These networks may use aggregated information about your visit to this site, such as the number of times you have viewed an ad (but not your name, address, email address, or other personal information), to serve ads to you on this site. Some ads are targeted specifically to the content within Math Playground.com and we have taken careful measures to ensure that these ads link only to family friendly advertisers. In response to the new COPPA rules, Math Playground.com does not permit behaviorally targeted ads on its site, and instead only shows contextually-based ads or other carefully-selected ads which are not based on a user's browsing behavior.
If you would still like to know more about this practice and the choices you may have about not having your information used by these companies for advertising purposes, please see: http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp
CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY
If we make changes to this privacy policy, we will post them here. If these changes significantly affect the way we handle children's personal information, we will first notify parents and obtain their prior consent, to the extent feasible and required by law.
