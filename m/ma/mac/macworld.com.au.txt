Log data. Our servers automatically record certain information sent by your browser, such as your Web request, your Internet Protocol address, your referring URL, your browser type and language, and the date and time of your request.
Cookie data. When you visit the Macworld Australia Web site, Macworld Australia or one of our IDG affiliates or third-party partners may send one or more “cookies”ï¿½small files containing a string of charactersï¿½to your computer to identify you as a unique user. If you have registered with Macworld Australia, the information in your cookie is used to provide a more personalized experience on our site, for example by allowing you to customize portions of the site. If you haven’t registered, the cookie identifies you as a unique user and helps ensure a smoother experience on the site, such as by limiting the number of times that you see certain subscription offers. If you have not registered on our site, we cannot link the user ID in the cookie with personal identifying information and data about you, such as your name or e-mail address.
Traffic and advertising data. Other cookies without personally identifying information and data are used to enable Macworld Australia to gather and analyze site traffic and usage information, and to allow our advertising partners to manage the advertisements presented. These cookies sometimes work in conjunction with other techniques, such as clear GIFs or pixel tags; they do not contain personally identifying information, but they may gather information about what sites you have visited and use that information to determine which ads appear when you visit the Australian Macworld site.
