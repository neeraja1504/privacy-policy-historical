Privacy Statement (Personal Information)
INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE: Our primary goals in collecting and using information are to provide and improve the service, to administer and assist you in administering your Account on the service, and to provide you with a better experience with the service. We store and process information in the United States. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, we transfer your information to the United States and processes it there, which is required for the normal operation of the service.
Personal information is information that specifically identifies an individual, including, but not limited to, an individual's name, email, credit card or other billing information and billing address (for the purposes of fulfilling a purchase order and licensing). Personal information does not include information that has been irreversibly anonymized or aggregated so that it can no longer enable us, whether in combination with other information or otherwise, to identify you.
Non-personal information is information that is not, on its own, personal information, such as an individual's IP, zip/postal code, but that may be considered part of an individual's personal information if combined with other identifiers in a way that enables identification of an individual.
What Personal Information We Collect
Depending on the services you use, we collect different kinds of personal information from or about you. In addition, we create a unique user ID to track your use of our services. This unique user ID is stored in connection with your information.
Information you provide - We collect information in any form you willingly enter data into. Such as your name and email during account registration. Any contact information you provide when asking us support questions. Signing up to our newsletter, or participating in public discussions and writing reviews.

When you launch any of our applications, we collect information regarding your device type, operating system and version, carrier provider, IP address, whether you are using a point package, the game version, and unique device ID. We may gather some of this information automatically. Where available, our services may use GEO Location, your IP address, and other technologies to determine an approximate location to allow us to improve our products and services.
Information from third parties - Some 3rd party services we use, may send us some other personal information you provided during use of their websites and services. Such as any information you provide on the "Store Support" website (managed by desk.com).

Purchase licensing - Some information may be used in the fulfillment process for game purchases that return a license code. Some licensing is handled through third parties, and every effort is made to provide the bare minimum actual personal information.
