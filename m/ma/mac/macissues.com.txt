How does MacNut Magazine use personally identifiable information?
MacNut Magazine uses any information voluntarily provided by members to improve the experience of using the website and services provided by MacNut Magazine.
MacNut Magazine uses tracking information (log files) to determine which portions of the site are more popular than others, but what individual members read is not tracked. Likewise, when a search is performed with the MacNut Magazine search engine, the search terms used are recorded, but individual search terms are not connected to individual members. Both of these tracking methods are helpful to determine the relative popularity of individual pages and to improve the accuracy of the search engine.
MacNut Magazine also creates aggregate reports on member demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers, sponsors, and business partners.
This results in advertising campaigns that are more effective for advertisers. However, MacNut Magazine does not track the usage patterns of individual members, and therefore, advertisers, sponsors, and business partners will not be able to tell that a specific user clicked on a particular advertisement.
