Profiling is gathering information about an individual or a group of individuals and analysing their characteristics or behaviour patterns in order to place them in a certain category or group, and/ or to make predictions or assessments about their ability to perform a task, their interests or likely behaviour. We use several types of profiling and analysis, including: data matching, segmentation and high value donor analysis. You can object to us profiling you by writing to our Data Protection Officer at Macmillan Cancer Support, 89 Albert Embankment, London SE1 7UQ, or by email at infogov@macmillan.org.uk.
We use profiling techniques to ensure communications are relevant and timely, and to provide an improved experience to our supporters. For example, we use profiling to send information about campaigns and services in your area, or to find potential new supporters and invite you to be involved in supporting our cause through tailored communications which may be of interest to you.
We do this because it allows us to understand the background of the people who support us and use our services and helps us to make appropriate requests to supporters who may be able and willing to give more than they already do or to tailor our services to better suit them. We also use profiling to exclude people who may be vulnerable from marketing, for example, people living in care homes. Profiling enables us to provide you with a service that is more relevant for you, while raising more funds, sooner, and more cost-effectively, than we otherwise would. Profiling allows us to be more efficient with our resources, which donors consistently tell us is a priority for them.
In order to create a profile for you, we (or our trusted service providers) may use the information which you give us and which we collect from external resources, including information that is publicly available about you. This sort of profiling can include us using information such as your age, property prices and average earnings where you live, your job, directorships, your financial circumstances, networks, any previous donations you have made, your philanthropic interests (trusteeships and/ or support to other charities), and your estimated wealth, to assess how likely it is that you would be interested in donating to us and the level of donation that you may be able to give. We use this information in our analysis of high value donors.
Data matching
We use Experian for data matching. If you support us, we will match your postcode to Experianâ€™s tool MOSAIC to get information about you such as household income, household composition and other demographic information. We then add this information to our record of you to tailor our marketing and services communications to you and to help us raise more funds.
Segmentation
We use Experian for behavioural analysis on our supporters, to help us segment our supporter database and to enable us to profile other supporters, if we have a legitimate interest to do so.
We also use software tools owned by other companies to help us analyse who is most likely to donate to us. We do this by using information we hold, such as your name, age, gender, address, donation history, the events and products you have engaged with, your volunteering status and any previous segmentation, and combining it with external profiling tools, to more accurately target our engagement with you.
We use a tool called FastStats by QBase for this purpose. QBase is based in the UK. We also use a tool called Raisers' Edge for the same purpose. Raiser's Edge is owned by Blackbaud, Inc. They are a US based company and are certified under the US Privacy Shield. These businesses may rely on others for further information, such as GI, YouGov or Experian.
We may also use this information to help us determine whether and in what ways you might be interested in getting involved in our other fundraising activities. You can let us know if you would prefer us not to profile you in the ways set out here by contacting our Data Protection Officer at Macmillan Cancer Support, 89 Albert Embankment, London SE1 7UQ, or by email at infogov@macmillan.org.uk
