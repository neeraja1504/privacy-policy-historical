When you provide PII to us, including when registering to receive email newsletters, catalog subscriptions or other information, or to make a purchase, MacMall provides you with the opportunity to opt-out of having your PII used by MacMall to send you advertising or promotional materials. Unless you have opted out of receiving such marketing materials, MacMall may use your PII to forward you, via email or mail, advertisements concerning MacMall products, services, special promotions, surveys or other opportunities from MacMall that we think may be of interest to you. Such advertisements may also concern third party companies' products and services, including companies in industries such as hardware and software, and other providers of the types of products that are sold or featured on the Site.

|  |  |  | How We Protect Your Personal Information
To help ensure the security of your PII, MacMall seeks to use security technology and procedures, which are reviewed periodically. We use encryption technology and Secure Socket Layers ("SSL") in all areas where your personal and account information is required. This means that the PII you submit to us via our Site is encrypted by your computer, and then decrypted again on our side, discouraging others from accessing your private information during transmission. If your browser does not support SSL or if you are unable to establish a secure connection due to a company firewall, please call us at (800) MACMALL to place your order by phone.
In addition, your personal, account information, and transaction history are kept behind our firewall.
