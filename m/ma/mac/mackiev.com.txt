SUMMARY
This is a brief summary of our Privacy Policy for your convenience. Please read the full Privacy Policy on this page for more details.

To the extent your information is collected or processed on the basis of consent, you can withdraw your consent at any time.

Please note that it may take some time, consistent with applicable law, for us to process your request.
If you have registered using several email addresses or names, you will need to express your privacy choices for each of them separately using the applicable procedures above.
Please note that even if you choose not to receive future direct marketing emails with offers or promotions, we may continue to send you service notifications about the related products and services, or answer your questions about a product or service, and such notifications or replies may still include offers or promotions for products or services.
You may choose NOT to provide us with any personal information — for example, by not registering — although we will still need your contact information to provide you with free trial versions of products, product update information, or technical support should you require them.
Before collecting and storing any personal information we get through the use of cookies, we first notify you and obtain your consent.

CHILDREN'S PRIVACY
In compliance with COPPA (the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act) and the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we have adopted the following policies to keep children safe:
We will NOT knowingly collect, use, or distribute personally identifiable information from children under the age of 16.
We do NOT have any automatic sharing services or technologies integrated in our products that could allow children to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable information.
We will NOT knowingly keep any personally identifiable information that is mistakenly included in a child's email submission, technical support inquiry, or other one-time request, if we know that the child is under the age of 16. Information will be removed immediately after the issue has been resolved.
We will NOT knowingly post any personally identifiable information that is inadvertently included in a child's submission to a general audience contribution area (if we ever provide any on our website) if we know that the child is under the age of 16. These submissions will be deleted and handled anonymously thereafter.
We will NOT knowingly provide any direct link to websites that are unsuitable for children or teens.
We will advise children under the age of 16 that they MUST obtain permission from their parent or guardian before sharing ANY personal information.
Upon request, we will immediately provide a parent or guardian with a description of the information that may have been provided about their child during a registration process or support request made through any of our products or web pages.
Many of our software products are created for children under the age of 16, but we do not knowingly ask for data from, or market directly to children under the age of 16. Our websites are not targeted at children under the age of 16. The aim of our websites and web pages for children’s software products is to provide information about our software products to and collect data from parents and teachers only.
If we find out that we mistakenly obtained any personal information from a child under the age of 16, we will delete that information from our systems immediately.
All school registrations are to be created by a teacher and are attached to the teacher's or the school's account.
