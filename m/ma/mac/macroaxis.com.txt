We'll Keep You In Touch
When you choose to register with us, Macroaxis logs you in automatically using your email address. This makes it easier for you as you don't have to create and remember a login identifier. The use of your email address for login also allows Macroaxis the chance to email you a new password in case you forget or lost your old one.
Macroaxis gives you the option of receiving emails from us. We'll keep you in loop about new features available on our service. We notify our users only for big release so you will not get more than 1 email in every quarter. If you like, you can opt out any time. Our emails are sent from a Macroaxis address and are sent to your real email address. Every email that we send has an instruction how to opt out from our notifications, so you can be unsubscribed when you want. We do hate spam and suspect that you do too.
