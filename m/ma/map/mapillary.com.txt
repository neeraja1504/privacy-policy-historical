Privacy Policy | Mapillary
We respect your right to privacy and will only process your personal information in accordance with applicable data protection and privacy laws.
In this Privacy Policy, "we," "us," "its" and "our" refer to Mapillary AB ("Mapillary"), organized under the laws of Sweden. Please read carefully this Privacy Policy ("Policy") relating to your submission of Content (as defined in Mapillary’s Terms of Use) to and use of Mapillary applications, services and websites. Other terms used with a capital initial letter are defined in the associated Terms of Use or the associated Mapillary Marketplace Terms.
A. Introduction
This Policy explains how Mapillary collects, stores, uses and discloses information from you when you submit Content to and use Mapillary products, services, mobile applications and websites. This Policy applies to users of the Mapillary "Service", defined as the services, APIs, and functionality we make available either through our website at www.mapillary.com and related site pages (the "Website"), via private sites or repositories, or through third party sites that utilize our services and functionality, as well as through our mobile application (the "App"). When stated, this Policy is also applicable to visitors of our Website, and persons pictured in Content submitted to the Service.
This Policy does not apply to websites, applications, or services that do not display or link to this Policy or that display or link to different privacy statements; nor does this Policy apply to practices of companies that we do not control or to people we do not employ or manage.
It may be possible for you to browse certain parts of the Website without telling us who you are or revealing any information that enables us to directly identify you as an individual. However, you may lose anonymity once you give us personal information about you. In particular and as applicable, this applies to any personal data you voluntarily submit in your bio/profile page and the geolocation data indexed to photos submitted.
B. Information Collected
We collect information in various ways when you use our Service and as set forth in the Terms of Use. Some of this information may be Personal Data attributable to you. As used in this Policy, "Personal Data" means any information (either alone or in combination with other information we hold) that directly or indirectly may be used to identify or identifies you as an individual, such as your name, address and physical location, account numbers, email addresses, or telephone numbers. These are examples and please note that you are not requested to submit all of this information but may choose to do so. If there is data that could be understood as Personal Data included in Content, e.g. faces of individuals or license plates of vehicles, these data are automatically blurred to avoid any identification of individuals before posting on Mapillary. As this is an automated process, we welcome any requests or comments if there is something we missed by e-mail to support@mapillary.com.
As well as Personal Data, we also collect some information that is not personally identifying, including aggregate information, which is data we collect about use of the Service or about a group or category of users from which it is not possible to identify you (“Nonpersonal Data”; together with Personal Data, collectively "Information").

If any Personal Data attributable to you is included in any uploaded Content it is necessary for us to process such Personal Data in order to properly provide our Service. To protect your personal integrity, we automatically blur any Personal Data in such Content before it is posted on our Service. As this is an automatic process, we welcome any requests or comments if there is something we missed by e-mail to support@mapillary.com.

General
We may use and provide data and information to our partners and customers for commercial purposes after we have removed your name or any other personally identifying information from it, or have combined it with other people's data in a way that it is no longer associated with you.
We also may combine your Information with information we collect from other sources to improve our products and services. Content (as defined in the Terms of Use) may be exposed to public search engines and publicly available search results and via third party sites and applications that access the Service.

You have the option of submitting Content and using the Service anonymously as the user name and e-mail address you submit may certainly be created specifically to avoid identifying you as an individual. If you do not submit a valid e-mail address however, this may interfere with your use of the Service through i.a. loss of relevant notifications. However, we cannot guarantee absolute anonymity and make no guarantee that other users will never be able to determine your identity, such as (without limitation) by observations of your activity, the manner in which you express yourself, and other patterns of conduct or behavior. Moreover, all of your activities on the Service will be traceable to your username, from which your actual identity may be known. Notices may be sent to other users regarding suspicious activity and policy violations and refer to usernames and specific items. Please understand that if you link your name with your username or e-mail address, others will be able to personally identify your activities.
Further, we may use Personal Data to respond to legal requirements, in connection with a merger, sale of assets, or other similar corporate transactions, to respond to claims that Content violates the rights of others, or to protect the rights, property, or safety or any person.
Your choices regarding our use of your Personal Information for marketing purposes
If you no longer wish to receive marketing-related emails from us on a going-forward basis, you may opt-out of receiving these marketing-related emails by following the unsubscribe instructions in any such message, or by emailing us at support@mapillary.com. We aim to comply with such request(s) as soon as reasonably practicable. Please note that if you do opt-out of receiving marketing-related emails from us, we may still send you administrative messages; you cannot opt-out from receiving administrative messages.
D. Personal data within Capture Projects and the Mapillary Marketplace
This Policy applies to such processing of Personal Data over which Mapillary is the data controller pursuant to the GDPR. However, if you are using the Mapillary Marketplace or Capture Projects, Mapillary and the Organization/Requester that you collect images for, will be joint controllers in relation to the processing of your personal data within the scope of such Services.
When two or more parties are joint controllers in regard to processing of personal data, as in the case of personal data processed within the scope of Capture Projects or the Mapillary Marketplace, the joint controllers are to determine their respective responsibilities according to the GDPR. This determination is made through an internal arrangement between the joint controllers. The internal arrangement in force between Mapillary and the Organization/Requester that you collect images for can be found in Mapillary’s Terms of Use.
Mapillary processes personal data under this joint controllership for the purposes and on such legal basis as set out in section C above, and as otherwise stipulated in this Policy. You can always contact Mapillary at support@mapillary.com if you have any questions regarding your personal data processed under joint controllership, or if you wish to exercise any of your rights under this Policy or the GDPR. For the purposes and legal basis of the Requester/Organization, we refer you to their respective privacy policy.
If the Requester/Organization that you collect images for is a private individual acting in their private capacity, Mapillary is instead the sole data controller of your personal data processed within the scope of the Mapillary Marketplace or Capture Projects, and this Policy (except for this section D) applies to that processing.
E. Sharing Information
We do not disclose, sell or rent your Personal Data to third parties for their marketing purposes without your prior consent. If you do consent but later change your mind, you may contact us and we will cease any such activity. We only share your Personal Data as follows:
(i) at your direction and control via your normal and intended operation of the Service, or with your consent, for example, when you agree to our sharing your Personal Data with other selected third parties for their own marketing purposes subject to their separate privacy policies;
(ii) with service providers, consultants or similar contractors, Requesters/Organizations (within the scope of Capture Projects or the Mapillary Marketplace), or third parties who provide services or content in connection with our Service in order to support or enhance our products and services or our business operations, or to make available and consummate initiated transactions;
(iii) to comply with laws or respond to lawful requests and legal process or to enforce or apply our terms of use/service, license terms, or other agreements between us, and to protect the rights, safety and property of Mapillary, our agents, employees customers, members, and others; and
(iv) under written obligations of confidentiality, in connection with or during negotiation of any a merger, financing, acquisition, or dissolution, transaction, or proceeding involving sale, transfer, divestiture, or disclosure of all or a portion of our business or assets to another company.
We may also share and disclose Nonpersonal Data for the same purposes as described above.
When other companies, e.g. our service providers, process your Personal Data on our behalf, we always enter into binding data processing agreements that ensure that your Personal Data always enjoys the same level of protection as under this Policy.
F. No Guarantee of Security
We apply appropriate technical and organizational safeguards and take all reasonable steps to help protect your Personal Data in an effort to prevent loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. However, no one can create a completely secure website, app or service and third parties may unlawfully intercept, steal or access transmissions or private communications. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that your Information or private communications that you transfer over the internet to us will always be secure or remain confidential.
G. Password
Your password deserves careful thought and protection. Use unique numbers, letters, and special characters and do not disclose your password to anyone. You shall not share your password or your personal sign-in credentials with others, and please remember that you are responsible for all actions taken in the name of your account. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personal information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. If your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately access your profile to change your password and notify us immediately at support@mapillary.com.
H. International Transfers
We may process Information on servers located in a number of countries. Accordingly, we may share Information with our service providers and affiliated companies for such companies to carry out any of the activities specified in this Policy. We may also subcontract processing to or share Information with third parties located in countries other than your home country. Information collected within the European Economic Area, for example, be transferred to, and processed by our affiliates or other third parties identified above that are located in, a country outside of the EEA. However, regardless of country, we will always process Information in accordance with this Policy. In respect to our service providers, we will always enter into a data processing agreement that ensure that their processing gives the same level of protection to your Personal Data as this Policy.
In addition to the above, any transfer of Personal Data from the EEA to a third country outside the EEA, will only be made if permitted by the applicable EU data protection regulation. This means that we will only initiate such transfer of Personal Data if the receiving country outside the EEA has been deemed by the EU Commission to ensure an appropriate level of protection, if we have entered into the Commission’s standard data protection clauses with the receiving company, or if there are other safeguards in place that permits such a transfer. You can receive a copy of such safeguards by e-mailing support@mapillary.com.
I. Children
The Services are not directed at or intended for children under thirteen (13) years of age, and we do not knowingly collect Personal Data from such children. If you believe that we might have any Personal Data from a child under 13 years of age, please contact us at support@mapillary.com.
J. Policy Changes
We may amend this Policy from time to time. If we make any changes to this Policy, we will post the amended terms on Mapillary.com, change the "Last Updated" date above, and where appropriate, notify you by email or via our other notification mechanisms.
K. Your Information, Rights and Choices
You have the right to ask us not to process your Personal Data for marketing or promotional purposes. We will usually inform you (before collecting your data) if we intend to use your data for such purposes or if we intend to disclose your information to any third party for such purposes.
