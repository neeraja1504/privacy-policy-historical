Maplewood Computing Privacy Statement
At Maplewood Computing Ltd. (“Maplewood”), we are committed to protecting the confidentiality, security and accuracy of the personal information we receive about you. The management of personal information is fundamental to our service and this Privacy Policy explains our approach to honouring this commitment.

If you are a staff member of a “client” (school/board/district/authority/agency/institution using Maplewood’s products or services) with authorized access to Maplewood’s customer collaboration site, information that you enter on the site will be recorded in Maplewood’s support tracking application. The support tracking application records your questions and problems, and a ticket number is assigned associating the client with the information you entered. This entered information is confidential information between Maplewood and the client, and is used to help answer your question or resolve your problem. There is the ability for Maplewood clients to “share” the contents of tickets with other Maplewood clients outside their educational authority, and this feature should only be used if no personal information will be disclosed. Maplewood is not responsible if personal information is shared by a client, however, we reserve the right to unshare any ticket.
If you are a staff member of a “client” with authorized access to Maplewood’s support services, we will collect the following personal information so that we can communicate with you about our services, including informing you about product and service updates, and responding to your support or other inquiries:

Maplewood’s clients collect, use and disseminate personal information from, and about, individuals in the course of providing educational services. Each client will have its own privacy policy regarding the information that may be used or disclosed by the client. All data collected by the client remains the property of the client. Creating and supporting student information applications is Maplewood’s core business. Maplewood may be granted access to the client’s data for the purpose of supporting, maintaining and enhancing Maplewood’s products and services as required by the client.
Maplewood Computing Ltd. is responsible for personal information under our control and is committed to a high standard of privacy for our information practices. This Privacy Policy incorporates the ten principles set out in the National Standard of Canada’s Model Code for the Protection of Personal Information, CAN/CSA-Q830-96.
Principle 1 - Accountability
Maplewood is responsible for personal information under our control, including personal information transferred to third parties for processing. Maplewood has designated an individual who is accountable for the organization’s compliance with this policy.
Maplewood complies with PIPEDA by:
implementing policies and procedures to protect your personal information, and all other confidential information including information relating to students, parents/guardians, emergency contacts, and school/board/district staff and affiliates;
responding to complaints and inquiries;
educating our staff about privacy policies and practices.
Principle 2 - Identifying Purposes for the Collection of Personal Information
Maplewood will identify the purposes for which personal information is collected at or before the time of collection. Unless the new purpose is required by law, the consent of the individual is required before information can be used for that purpose.
Personal student/staff/affiliate information under our control but collected by the school/board/district will be subject to that school/board/district privacy policy. Persons collecting personal information should be able to explain to individuals the purposes for which the information is being collected.
Principle 3 - Consent for the Collection, Use, and Disclosure of Personal Information
Maplewood will obtain the consent of individuals before or when it collects, uses, discloses and retains personal information, except where authorized by law.
Principle 4 - Limiting Collection of Personal Information
Only the information necessary for the purposes identified may be collected. Maplewood will collect personal information by fair and lawful means.
Principle 5 - Limiting Use, Disclosure, and Retention of Personal Information
Personal information may be used only for the purposes for which it was collected, except with your consent or as required by law. The information is retained only as long as necessary for the fulfilment of those purposes.
Principle 6 - Ensuring Accuracy of Personal Information
Maplewood will make every effort to ensure the information we hold is accurate, complete and up-to-date as is necessary for the purposes for which it is to be used.
Principle 7 - Ensuring Safeguards for Personal Information
Maplewood applies security safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of personal information to aim to protect it against loss, theft, unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification, regardless of its format.
The nature of the safeguards will vary depending on the sensitivity of the information that has been collected, the amount, distribution, and format of the information, and the method of storage. Protection may include physical measures (i.e., locked filing cabinets and restricted access), organizational measures (limiting access on a "need-to-know" basis), and technological measures (use of passwords, encryption and audits).
New staff are required to complete privacy and confidentiality education and sign a confidentiality agreement as a condition of employment. Contracted staff are bound to privacy and confidentiality as a condition of the contract. All new staff and contracted staff have criminal record checks and vulnerable person screening. Care is used in the disposal or destruction of personal information, to prevent unauthorized parties from gaining access to the information.
Principle 8 - Openness About Personal Information Policies and Practices
Maplewood will make readily available to individuals specific information about its policies and procedures relating to the management of personal information. The information made available shall include:
the name or title, and the address, of the person who is accountable for the organization’s policies and practices and to whom complaints or inquiries can be forwarded;

a description of the type of personal information held by the organization, including a general account of its use.
Contact information for Maplewood’s Privacy Officer, to which complaints or inquiries can be forwarded, is provided in Principle 10.
Principle 9 - Individual Access to Own Personal Information
On written/email request, and subject to the exemptions stipulated by law, Maplewood will inform individuals of the existence, use, disclosure and retention of their personal information and provide access to that information. An individual will be able to challenge the accuracy and completeness of the information and have it amended as appropriate. In certain situations, Maplewood may not be able to provide access to all of the personal information that it holds about an individual. These situations shall be limited to those required or stipulated by law.
