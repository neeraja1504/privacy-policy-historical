This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information we gather. When you provide personal data during Online Counseling or other services offered by Mapping Your Future, the information is encrypted prior to transfer. Data is stored in a secured database and is administered with routine backup procedures.

Participating in a voluntary survey
Participating in Online Counseling
Participating in MappingXpress
Subscribing to a Mapping Your Future newsletter
We also may collect your personal information from others, such as your school or state guaranty agency.
Why can't I limit all sharing?
Mapping your Future needs this information and the ability to share it so that we can help you. If you were able to limit us fully from sharing this information, we would be unable to offer you the assistance you are requesting from us. Federal law gives you the right to limit only:
sharing for affiliates' everyday business purposes
affiliates from using your information to market to you
sharing for nonaffiliates to market to you
State laws and individual companies may give you additional rights to limit sharing.
