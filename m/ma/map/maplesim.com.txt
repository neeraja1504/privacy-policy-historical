Maplesoft Web Sites and Services
When you are visiting our web site or using our web-based services, we want you to feel secure that Maplesoft is respecting your privacy. The only private information we have about you is the information you choose to give us by filling out a form or an order.
Our web sites use cookies. A cookie is a piece of data that identifies you as a unique user. Maplesoft uses this information to better serve all visitors as we improve the content and design of the services, and to enhance the convenience of using the services by reducing redundant information entry for Users.
The default setting on most web browsers is to accept cookies. You can change this setting to refuse any cookie, or to be prompted when a cookie is being sent. Please note, however, that some areas and features of our services will not function properly if you refuse cookies.
If you are logged in to your Maplesoft account, we collect data about your interactions with Maplesoft web sites and services. This information could include your posts on our user forums, the applications you upload or download on our application sharing sites, your activities on our web store, and which pages on our web sites you visit. We collect this information to provide services such as awarding badges and reputation points on MaplePrimes, to improve our web sites, and to analyze engagement with our audience.
If you are not logged in to your account when you interact with our web site, any data we collect will not be associated with you. However, note that functionality of some Maplesoft services will be restricted if you are not logged in. For example, if you are not logged in, you cannot post to a user forum, upload an application, or access private files in the MapleCloud.
Email Communications
Maplesoft operates multiple commercial subscription-based email lists that interested parties can opt-in or opt-out of at any time from the email management area of the Maplesoft web site.
From time to time, Maplesoft may create new subscription-based commercial email lists and may pre-populate these lists with existing Maplesoft email list subscribers, based on subscriber profiles. If you are not already a Maplesoft email subscriber, you will not be added to any newly created Maplesoft email lists.
If you are a Maplesoft customer, and/or you have communicated with Maplesoft recently, you may periodically receive emails from Maplesoft staff or from a Maplesoft email account ending with @maplesoft.com, including emails such as new product updates, security updates, technical updates, customer service updates, and other commercial email communications considered relevant to you, based on your customer or contact profile.
If you would prefer to never receive commercial emails from Maplesoft, you have the option to remove yourself from all present and future email lists by globally unsubscribing by emailing privacy@maplesoft.com. You may still subscribe to any Maplesoft email list after globally unsubscribing, and by doing so you will be removed from the global unsubscribe list and put on the list(s) that you subscribe to.
Emails verifying opt-in and opt-out requests are automatically sent to the recipient after each email subscription update.
Products
Our software products require you to activate your license. Activation requires a one-time exchange of information between your computer and Maplesoft. We collect contact information that we use for customer service purposes, such as sending out notifications of software maintenance updates.  We also collect basic, non-identifying system information that is used to activate your product. This information also enables us to help you in the future if you have problems with your license. It may also be used for other customer service or development purposes, such as identifying customers who may be subject to problems specific to a single platform, or identifying trends in platform usage.
Software piracy is illegal and Maplesoft reserves the right to take all legal steps to stop piracy of their products and pursue those who take part in these activities. As part of these anti-piracy efforts, our software may contain security mechanisms intended to detect the installation or use of illegal copies of the Software. If an illegal copy is detected, the product may collect and transmit network, device, usage, user, and other data relating to the installation or use of those illegal copies, to Maplesoft and/or their agents. Such data may include, but is not limited to, host name, username, device ID, IP address, Wi-Fi access point information, email address, and information about usage of the software. Maplesoft and/or their agents may use this information to identify and contact users of illegal copies of the Software in order to bring them into license compliance. This data collection is not performed on the users of legally licensed software from Maplesoft and its authorized distributors.

Maplesoft will apply these principles regardless of the specific technologies employed for data collection and use.
