From time to time, Maplesoft may create new subscription-based commercial email lists and may pre-populate these lists with existing Maplesoft email list subscribers, based on subscriber profiles. If you are not already a Maplesoft email subscriber, you will not be added to any newly created Maplesoft email lists.

You may still subscribe to any Maplesoft email list after globally unsubscribing, and by doing so you will be removed from the global unsubscribe list and put on the list(s) that you subscribe to.
Emails verifying opt-in and opt-out requests are automatically sent to the recipient after each email subscription update.
