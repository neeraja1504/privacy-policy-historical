How do we protect your information?
We take a range of appropriate technical and organisational measures which are intended to prevent unauthorised or unlawful processing of personal data and accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, personal data. The following are only examples of the various steps we take to protect your personal data.
When you pay for your order online, we work with a reputable third party payment gateway Cybersource. Cybersource uses internet standard encryption technology, Secure Socket Layer (SSL), which encodes your credit card details before it is sent. Furthermore, as required by the UK Data Protection Acts of 1984 and 1998 and the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EU Directive) Regulations 2003 we follow strict procedures in the storage and disclosure of information, which you have provided to us, to prevent unauthorised access. Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we are able to disclose personal data to you.
We require all third parties to whom any personal data is disclosed to keep it secure, treat it as confidential information and only use it for the purpose of providing their services and to fully comply with all applicable provisions of the Data Protection Act 1998.
We will not disclose your personal data to any third party except as set out in this Privacy Policy.

We and other companies in the Mamas & Papas group may also store, use or otherwise process personal data outside the EEA. Data protection laws may not be as strong outside the EEA as they are in the EEA. Personal data will not be transferred to a country outside the EEA unless (1) the country to which it is transferred is one which the European Commission considers to provide an adequate level of data protection or (2) the personal data is transferred to a United States company which has signed up to the Privacy Shield scheme or (3) the personal data is transferred to a company which is required by our contract with them only to deal with the data in accordance with our instructions and to maintain appropriate security to protect the personal data which we are satisfied they have.
Our mail server is located in the UK. E-mail addresses, names and postal information are processed through this server. The third party who handles this processing has entered into a contract with us which meets the above requirements.
