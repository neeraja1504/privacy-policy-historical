Security
We use a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your Personal Data. We take great care to ensure that your Personal Data is stored securely on our servers, and we follow the standards generally accepted in the industry to protect Personal Data submitted to us. In particular, we:
we encrypt many of our services using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) when transmitting data. When a browser attempts to access a website that is secured by SSL, the browser and the web server establish a SSL connection, using keys. SSL creates a secure connection by establishing an encrypted connection.
hashing is used when storing passwords. Hashing is a one-way function in which a hashed value cannot be reversed to obtain the password. Only an encryption key can decrypt the password. Only the hashed password is stored by Makeblock.
we review our information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security measures, to guard against unauthorized access to systems.
we restrict access to Personal Data to our employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to process if for Makeblock and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations.
It is important to note, however, that no method of transmission or storage via the internet is 100% secure, and thus we cannot absolutely guarantee the security of your Personal Data submitted via the Site.
We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects Personal Data from accidental or malicious destruction. As a consequence, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems.
