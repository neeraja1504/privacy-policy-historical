• You can choose the level of access that others have to your profile, including access to your full
profile, friends list, personal photos and notes; however, all Members, regardless of profile
settings automatically have a public profile created, which displays User Name, Profile Image
(if provided), Lists and Selections, and the URL to your Public Profile. This allows others to
see who is commenting on lists and items. Any comments and content that you post to lists,
comment areas, and other profiles may be viewable to any site user. We will not display your
email address to other site users without your consent.
• You post Content on the site at your own risk. Although you can choose the level of access that
