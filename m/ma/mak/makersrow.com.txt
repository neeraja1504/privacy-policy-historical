1. What Information Do We Collect?
Passive Information We Collect About You
When you visit makersrow.com, some information is automatically collected, such as your IP address, browser type, system type, the content and pages that you access on the Site, the “referring URL” (i.e., the page from which you navigated to makersrow.com), the pages you navigate to on the Site, and from which you leave the Site, as well as the time you spend on the Site. In addition to using Uniform Resource Locators (URL), we also use Cookies to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the information for which you searched and viewed.
We use cookies to collect additional website usage data, and to improve and personalize the Site and our service to you. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer's hard disk.
We do not use cookies to collect personally identifiable information. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with the Site and our service, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on the Site, and to improve the Site and our services. A session cookie enables certain features of the Site and our service and is deleted from your computer when you disconnect from or leave the Site. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser help file directions. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.
We collect information passively using technologies such as standard server logs, cookies, and clear GIFs (also known as “Web beacons”). We use passively-collected information to administer, operate, and improve makersrow.com and our other services and systems, and to provide services and content that are tailored to you. We may aggregate information collected from our users to show statistical data to our potential investors. WE WILL NOT SHARE, SELL, RENT, SWAP OR OTHERWISE AUTHORIZE ANY THIRD PARTY TO ACCESS YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION.
Also, please be aware that third parties may set cookies on your hard drive or use other means of collecting information about your use of their services or content. We do not have access to, or control over, these third-party means of passive data collection and do not assume responsibility for such third-party privacy practices.
Personal Information We Collect From You
We may also collect personal information from you, specifically information that you provide to us when you create your factory profile or user account.
