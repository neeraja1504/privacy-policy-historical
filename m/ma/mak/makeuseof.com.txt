They are also used to help us understand your preferences based on previous or current site activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services.

We use Google Analytics to track and analyze our web traffic. We do not have access to the information collected by Google apart from what is displayed in our Google Analytics portal.
We have implemented the following data collection features in Google Analytics:
1. Remarketing with Google AdSense
Enables data collection for Display and Search Remarketing. This includes data from Google’s signed-in users who have chosen to enable Google to associate their web and app browsing history with their Google account, and to use such information from their Google account to personalize ads. Google Analytics temporarily joins these identifiers to your Google Analytics data in order to support your audiences. When you enable this setting, you must adhere to the Google Analytics Advertising Features Policy, including rules around sensitive categories and the necessary privacy disclosures to your end users about the data you collect and share with Google.
2. Advertising Reporting Features
Enables Advertising Reporting features like Audience Demographics and Interests Reporting, DoubleClick Campaign Manager reporting, DoubleClick Bid Manager reporting, and Google Display Network Impression Reporting that help you better understand your users.

We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.
California Online Privacy Protection Act
CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. – See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf
According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:
Users can visit our site anonymously.
Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website.
Our Privacy Policy link includes the word ‘Privacy’ and can easily be found on the page specified above.
You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes on our Privacy Policy Page.
You can change your personal information by logging in to your account.
How does our site handle Do Not Track signals?
We honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.
Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?
It’s also important to note that we allow third-party behavioral tracking
COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)
When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States’ consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children’s privacy and safety online.
We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.
Fair Information Practices
The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.
In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur we will notify you via email within 7 business days.
We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
CAN SPAM Act
The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.
We collect your email address in order to send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions
To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:
Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses.
Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way.

Affiliate Disclaimer
We love researching and reviewing stuff, then sharing our findings with you. And you can help us keep the lights on.
You may have noticed that we often use Amazon links when recommending products. We’re consumers too – often, our review products are purchased from Amazon. So if you do decide to use our links to purchase a product we’re recommending, then we get paid a small commission, and in turn, you’ll shop with confidence knowing that Amazon will deliver your product safely.
You’ll also be glad to know that our recommendations are always based on the merits of the items. As you can tell from our product review conclusions, we always provide advice on whether a product is worth purchasing. We would never recommend anything we wouldn’t buy ourselves.
You’ll also notice that we use iTunes affiliate links where appropriate. Rest assured, these affiliate links do not affect you in any way. They will, however, share a small portion of the sale with us. These links are always added after the article or review is written. We won’t publish a biased review for the sole purpose of profiting from affiliate sales. That goes against our principles.
We use Amazon Associates and VigLink to retroactively and automatically convert eligible links. You can opt out of Viglink, if you wish.
Some of our Best Of lists also contain affiliate links. Notable ones include our Best Web Hosting Services and Best VPN Service Providers. These pages were created with our readers in mind, and therefore, we only recommend the best apps and services. Affiliate links were inserted only as an afterthought, which again, pays us a very small compensation if you do decide to buy or sign up for a service. These links also appear in individual review articles.
And now, some legal stuff:
Disclosure of Material Connection: Some of the links on MakeUseOf.com are “affiliate links.” This means if you click on the link and purchase the item, we will receive an affiliate commission. Regardless, we only recommend products or services we believe will add value to our readers. We also receive compensation for sponsored posts and emails.We are disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission’s 16 CFR, Part 255: “Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising.”
A quick word regarding sponsored articles, manuals and giveaways
Whenever a company contracts us to write about their product in the form of a review, manual or giveaway, in exchange for compensation, we will always disclose that fact in the published work. We only choose to partner with high-quality clients in order to preserve our reputation. At the same time, we try to be as honest as possible, ensuring that our readers receive the most truthful information about the apps and services we review. Therefore, you have nothing to worry about — sponsored articles, manuals and giveaways are written by the same people who publish regular, non-sponsored articles, and contains the same advice we’d normally dish out. We do not discriminate.
