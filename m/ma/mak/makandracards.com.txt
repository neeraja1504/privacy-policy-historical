f) Use of Google Analytics
This Website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA ( "Google" ).
Google Analytics uses so called "cookies", i.e., small text files that are stored on the computer of the user and make it possible to analyse the Website usage. Usually the information stored in cookies about the Website usage is transmitted to a Google server in the USA and saved there. On makandra’s Website IP anonymization is enabled so that Google will shorten the user’s IP address within a member state of the European Union or a contracting party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the US and shortened there so that data processing might take place outside the European Union. In such case personal data collected by means of Google Analytics will be transferred to the USA. Google Inc. is certified under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield (see https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI) and thus has provided the legal requirements for ensuring an adequate level of data protection for the provision of the Google Analytics service by means of processing on behalf of the controller.
The user can object to the use of Google Analytics and prevent the storage of cookies by respective browser settings as explained above under section 3 c). The user can also stop data (incl. his IP address) created by cookies and associated with his website usage from being sent to Google or processed by Google by downloading and installing the browser add-on for deactivation of the Google Analytics JavaScrip available at the following link http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en.
