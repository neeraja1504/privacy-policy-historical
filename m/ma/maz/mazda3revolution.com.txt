Privacy Policy
We are strong advocates of anti-SPAM measurements and will never sell any personal information you provide to us to receive news feeds, be a member of our forums or leave comments on our website.
We have ongoing marketing relationships and affiliations with advertisers that we may link to on our website in the event that our advertising partners are able to provide a service you are seeking. All third party websites, including our advertising partners, have their own privacy policies.
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click here.
Though we do thorough analysis of all advertising partners before accepting them into our community we still encourage you to read their privacy policies so that you understand how each partner will use personal information that you submit to them. Privacy policies are most often found in the footer (bottom) of each page on a website.
