MaxSold respects the privacy of its Internet users.
MaxSold does not collect information that personally identifies individuals except when individuals provide such specific information on a voluntary basis. There may be occasions where specific personal information is requested before an individual can enter certain sections of a MaxSold site. For example, registration is needed to enter the Auction or to participate in any MaxSold forum or newsletter. This kind of registration helps us to ensure that standards on these sections of the site are upheld or that contact can be made with auction winners. Information requested in order to personalize the MaxSold homepage would be a similar example.
In all such cases, MaxSold will collect only information that is voluntarily provided by the user and undertakes that such information will be kept strictly confidential. Individual information provided to the MaxSold to gain access to any MaxSold site will not be sold or made available to a third party.
MaxSold does reserve the right, however, to perform statistical analyses of user behaviour and characteristics, in order to measure interest in and use of the various sections of its sites so as to improve design and navigation and to gather marketing information. Only aggregated data from these analyses, not individual data, will be used for this purpose.
As well, users should be aware that certain non-personal information and data may be automatically collected by the MaxSold through the operation of what are called "cookies". "Cookies" are small text files that identify an individual computer's browser entering a web site. They allow the site to track that browser's movement through the site over several sessions. Through cookies, a web site can recognize repeat users, facilitate the user's access to and use of the site and allow a site to track usage behaviour that will allow content improvements. The MaxSold uses cookies only for the above-mentioned purposes and will not use them to identify users or to track non-MaxSold usage.
If you do not want a cookie placed on your computer by MaxSold, you may disable cookies altogether by modifying the Preferences section of your Netscape or Internet Explorer browser (under Edit/Preferences/Advanced). Note that it is possible that some aspects of MaxSold sites may be unavailable to you if you choose this option.
If you have no problem accepting cookies, but wish to be informed of their appearance, you may turn on a warning prompt by modifying the cookie warning section in Edit/Preferences/Advanced.
