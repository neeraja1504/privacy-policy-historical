In their words….
“I have nothing but positive things to say about the company and the product! From the first day I spoke to a representative about their product until now, I have been impressed by their knowledge of student conduct processes, our need to track data for Clery reporting, and their responsiveness to the client. I couldn’t imagine a better partner for us than Maxient!”
