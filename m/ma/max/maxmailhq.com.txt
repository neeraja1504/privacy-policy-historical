Our legal basis for using your personal information
Entering into and performing the contract with you: If you have an Maxmail account or have registered to the Website or service, our legal basis for processing your personal information is that it is necessary for the performance of CyberCom ’s terms and conditions, terms of business and/or terms of use, as the case may be, and to provide a service to you. With respect to a Maxmail account, this includes facilitating access to our platform, processing payments and executing trades.
For other justifiable grounds, including legal obligation and legitimate interests: We process your personal information where necessary for CyberCom to comply with legal and regulatory obligations we are under, and also where it is necessary for legitimate interests we have in conducting our business. These include without limitation:
Learning about your interests and preferences to contact you with information that is relevant to you and helping us target marketing communications and adverts so that they are more relevant to you.
Analysing and continually improving the Website and our services and helping us pilot test versions of the Website internally to develop new features and ensure the efficient running of CyberCom’s services.
Detecting and reducing fraud and credit risk.
Customer Testimonials/Reviews/Comments
We post customer testimonials/comments/reviews on the Website which may contain personally identifiable information. We do obtain the customer's consent via email prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial.
Data Retention
We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services contact us at https://www.maxmailhq.com/support. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
Security
We protect your personal information by using data security technology and using tools such as firewalls and data encryption. We also require that you use a personal username and password every time you access your account online. As set out in the relevant Maxmail’s terms and conditions, terms of business and/or terms of use, as the case may be, you must not share your password with anyone else. We restrict access to personal information at our offices so that only officers and/or employees with a genuine need can access it. CyberCom takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the Website, your information is protected both online and off-line.
When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with industry-standard strong encryption - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'.
While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to your information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked door.
Users of the Maxmail Service must realize that although CyberCom employs high levels of security, no data transmission over the internet can be 100% safe.
Therefore, use of CyberCom's Messaging is at the client's own risk.
Furthermore, users must be aware that sending messages with CyberCom will have a similar level of security and reliability as that of Mobile Phone Networks.
CyberCom, its employees and contractors will not be held liable for any loss or damage whatsoever, incurred through the use of CyberCom SMS Messaging, including loss of information due to carrier failure, network failure or negligence on the part of CyberCom , its employees or contractors.
Please refer to our Terms and Conditions and Disclaimer for more information.

These communications may relate to your trading activity, account status, social interactions on Maxmail, or may include Cybercom’s updates and promotions. You can opt out of receiving updates at any time by clicking the “ Unsubscribe ” link at the bottom of any email from Maxmail, or by visiting https://www.maxmailhq.com/support.
Retention of personal information
The period for which we will retain personal information will vary depending on the purposes that it was collected for, as well as the requirements of any applicable law or regulation.
