We do not sell your personal information under any circumstances. We may pass certain information to third party vendors who help us to provide services to you (i.e., Recurly). We may disclose your personal information if we are required by law to do so or if you violate our Terms of Service.
SECTION 5 – RECURLY.
Monthly payments are processed by Recurly. They provide us with the online platform that allows us to manage monthly subscriptions, send out payment reminders, and process payments on a monthly basis.
Recurly stores your payment information in order to process monthly payments, and takes precautions to ensure the security of your Personal Data. However, they cannot guarantee that hackers / unauthorized personnel will not gain access to your Personal Data, despite their efforts.

In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us.

In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in a different jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves the services of a third-party service provider, then your information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its facilities are located.
As an example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction is processed by a payment gateway in the United States, then the personal information used in completing that transaction may be subject to disclosure under United States legislation, including the Patriot Act.
