Privacy Policy | MAXIMUS
Effective February 16, 2017
Our Commitment to Privacy
MAXIMUS, Inc. (together with its affiliates, "MAXIMUS") respects your privacy and we have developed the following policy to demonstrate our commitment to you. This privacy policy applies to personal information we collect about you on the MAXIMUS website located at www.maximus.com (the “Site”) and describes the types of information collected, how that information is used, and the choices users have about collection and use of this information. This privacy policy does not govern privacy practices associated with offline activities, websites other than this Site, or products and services not available or enabled via this Site, except as expressly set forth in this Privacy Policy.
Information We Collect
Although much of the Site is available without registration or providing personal information, in order to take advantage of some of our Site’s features, you will be asked to provide personal information. This personal information is provided voluntarily by you, the user, in order to participate or register for a particular product or service, or when you otherwise communicate with us or the Site. Personal information will be collected at various pages on the Site, including when you:
Submit an online inquiry
Submit an investor relations information request
Sign up for email alerts, newsletters and other MAXIMUS information
Submit an employment application
We clearly identify data you must provide so we can deliver the services or information you request. MAXIMUS may ask that you provide personal information, such as your first and last name, mailing address (including ZIP/Postal code), country of residence, email address, employer, job title and department, telephone numbers and other personal information. Providing this information is optional, but failure to do so in some cases will limit the services available to you.
In addition, our web servers automatically collect and log web usage data from you when you visit the Site. This information, including your Internet Protocol (IP) address, referring sites, pages viewed, browser type, operating system, CPU speed, referring or exit web pages, and length of visit, informs us about how visitors use and navigate the Site.
How We Use and Share the Information Collected
MAXIMUS does not share your personally identifiable information to unaffiliated third parties, but we may use your information to, among other things:
Provide newsletters and information about MAXIMUS
Provide the information or service requested or otherwise respond to your inquiries
Improve the content, navigation and efficiency of the Site
Make you aware of other benefits, products, services or events offered by MAXIMUS that may interest you
Enforce the MAXIMUS Terms of Use and otherwise prevent illegal or improper activity related to the Site
In order to respond to an information request you submit through the Site, we may share your personal information with our affiliated companies that may be able to respond directly to your inquiry. In addition, we may disclose your information to third parties (1) in connection with a merger, sale or consolidation of all or substantially all our assets, or (2) to comply with valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena or court order. By using this Site, you agree and acknowledge that personal information collected through the Site may be transferred across national boundaries and stored and processed in any country around the world, including the United States.
We may use and share with others aggregated or anonymous (not personally identifiable) information that we have collected based on web usage data, surveys or statistical information that we have compiled about our users.
Employment Applications
MAXIMUS collects your personal information to allow us to process your application for employment. Your personal information will be treated as confidential and made accessible only to authorized MAXIMUS employees and/or suppliers, external representatives and third parties engaged specifically to support MAXIMUS in conducting recruitment and selection or onboarding activities and for employment purposes in respect of successful candidates.
You may be asked to provide additional information not contained in your application to assist the recruitment and selection processes (for example, references or for vetting and/or security checks). If you choose not to provide the requested information, it may limit our ability to assess your suitability for employment and we may be unable to proceed with your application.
