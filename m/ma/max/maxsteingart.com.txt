We reserve the right to release personal information or other information about users who we believe are engaged in illegal activities or are otherwise in violation of our Terms of Service, even without a subpoena, warrant or court order, if we believe, in our sole discretion, that such disclosure is necessary or appropriate to operate our web site or to protect the rights or property of www.maxsteingart.com, our affiliates, or our officers, directors, employees, agents, third-party content providers, suppliers, sponsors, or licensor's. We also reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities we reasonably believe in our sole discretion to be unlawful.

Cookies
A cookie is a text file stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Many web sites create cookies to record information about a user's preferences, such as the items you add to your shopping cart, and for security purposes (see Security below). Cookies may also used to help us determine the various services you use and the support you may need, and to help us detect and solve any problems you may have while using our web site. Most cookies expire after a certain time period. If you wish, you may set your browser to reject all cookies and still view our web site.
Log Files
Like most standard web sites, we use log files on our servers. These log files store information regarding IP (internet protocol) addresses, browser type, ISP (internet service provider), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks. These log files are used to analyse trends, administer the web site, track user's movements in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for our use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personal information. In addition, we utilize Google Analytics to evaluate traffic on our website. Google Analytics stores information similar to that described above.
Sharing of General or Demographic Information
We may share aggregated, general or demographic information we collect about our users and their use of our web site with our third-party partners and advertisers in a manner which does not identify any individual user. We use an outside shipping company to ship orders placed on our web site, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services purchased on our web site. These companies will not retain, share, store or use any of our user's personal information for any secondary purposes. We may partner with other parties to provide specific services which are available on our web site. When a user signs up for these services, we will share the user's name or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services to the user. These parties are not allowed to use such personal information except for the purpose of providing these services.
www.maxsteingart.com partners with Amazon.com to sell books, CD's and tapes. www.maxsteingart.com does not pass any personal information to Amazon and no personal information is shared by Amazon back to www.maxsteingart.com.

Links
The web site contains links to other web sites. We want you to be aware that when you click on such links, including banner advertising, which take you to a third-party web site, you will be subject to such third-party's privacy policies. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other web sites and we expressly disclaim any and all liability for the actions of third-parties, including, without limitation, actions relating to the use and/or disclosure of personal information by such third-parties.

Surveys & Contests
From time-to-time, our web site may request information from our users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user has a choice whether or not to provide us with such information.

Security
This web site takes precautions we believe are reasonable to protect our users' information. When you submit personal information via our web site, your information is protected by us both on-line and off-line.
When our registration or order form asks users to enter personal information, such as credit card account number or social security number, such information will be encrypted by our encryption software, which is provided by Secure Socket Layer (SSL), before such information is transmitted over the internet. SSL prevents unauthorized people from intercepting your personal data. It is important to use a browser that supports SSL, such as Google Chrome, Apple Safari or Microsoft Internet Explorer. These browsers show a symbol in the status bar, such as a key or a lock, when you are viewing a web site that uses SSL. To learn more about SSL, you may visit their web site at: http://www.ssl.com.
While we use SSL encryption to protect users' personal information on-line, we also protect our users' information off-line. All of our users' information, including both general and personal information, is carefully stored in our offices and the facilities of our web hosting provider. Only employees who use such information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personal information. In addition, the servers that we store personal information on are kept in a physically and electronically secure environment.
We make efforts we believe are reasonable to prevent the alteration, theft, loss or misuse of our users' information by others. However, please keep in mind that there is always some risk in transmitting information over the Internet.
If you have any questions about the security of our web site, you can send an email to support@maxsteingart.com
