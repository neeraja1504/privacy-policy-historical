How MaxMouth Uses Information

Any personal information or video content that you voluntarily disclose online (e.g. on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, within your public profile page, etc.) becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by others. Your account name (not your email address) is displayed to other Users when you upload videos, post comments, or vote through the MaxMouth Sites and other Users can contact you through messages and comments.

We may use your email address or other personally identifiable information to send commercial or marketing messages  to you.  You have the ability to choose whether or not to receive these message through your user account that you create when you become a Registered User (or that you subsequently modify or update).

We use both your personally identifiable information and certain non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, click stream data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of the MaxMouth Sites and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing User preferences and trends.
We use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the MaxMouth Sites; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns; and (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.
When MaxMouth Discloses Information
We provide personally identifiable information and non-personally-identifiable information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or other businesses or persons for the purpose of processing such information on our behalf.

From time to time we may share your profile information to carefully selected companies whose products and services may be of interest to you.
We share non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third-parties to assist them in understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on the MaxMouth Sites.
We may release personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information if required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright Law) or respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant.

You may update or correct your personal profile information and email preferences at any time by visiting your account profile page. Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites
MaxMouth permits other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the MaxMouth Sites. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the MaxMouth Sites. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content you see.
MaxMouth does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks . However, please note that if an advertiser asks MaxMouth to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 18-24 who have viewed certain channels of content) and you respond to that advertisement by clicking the ad, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. The advertiser may also use information regarding your use of the MaxMouth Sites that they collect by virtue of you clicking through on an ad,(such as the number of times you viewed an ad), to determine which ads to deliver to you.
You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks  for more information on their practices. MaxMouth's privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites.
Our Commitment to Data Security
MaxMouth uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to MaxMouth and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, MaxMouth makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.
If MaxMouth learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you as required by law so that you can take appropriate protective steps.
To protect your privacy and security, we use industry standard security technologies and we take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you profile access or making corrections.
