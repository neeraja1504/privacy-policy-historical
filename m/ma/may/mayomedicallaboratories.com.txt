Privacy Policy - Mayo Medical Laboratories
We respect the right to privacy of all visitors to the MayoMedicalLaboratories.com website. We do not collect information that would personally identify you unless you choose to provide it. The personal information that you submit is shared only with those people in the Mayo organization who need this information to respond to your question or request. Information submitted through Mayo Medical Laboratories' online forms may be collected to ensure technical functionality. It will also be utilized to address any inappropriate use of our website. We do not save personal information to use for other purposes, nor do we provide it to any other organization.
We have taken reasonable steps to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of personally identifiable information that you may provide. You should understand, however, that electronic transmissions via the Internet are not necessarily secure from interception, and so we cannot absolutely guarantee the security or confidentiality of such transmissions.
Except for authorized law enforcement investigations or other valid legal processes, we will not share any personally identifiable information we receive from you with any parties outside of Mayo Clinic.
Surveys
We occasionally survey visitors to our website. The information from these surveys is used in aggregate form to help us understand the needs of our visitors so that we can improve our website. We generally do not ask for information in surveys that would personally identify you; if we do request contact information for follow-up, you may decline to provide it. If survey respondents provide personal information (such as an email address) in a survey, it is shared only with those people who need to see it to respond to the question or request.

The web server automatically collects the internet protocol (IP) address of the computers that access our website. An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer when you access the Internet.
