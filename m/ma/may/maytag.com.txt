Privacy Policy | Maytag
We collect two types of information: Personal Information and Other Information. “Personal Information” is information that can be used to identify you as an individual. “Other Information” is information that does not reveal an individual’s specific identity or does not directly relate to an identifiable individual, including information that has been de-identified or aggregated.
1. Personal Information
Information You Provide to Us. When you sign up for a Whirlpool account, contact us, sign up to receive communications from us , submit your product registration, or enter a sweepstakes or contest entry (either online or offline), we may ask you to provide your Personal Information, which may include:
Your contact information, such as your name, email address, mailing address, and phone number
Your billing information, such as your credit card number and billing address
Your Whirlpool account information, including your user name, account number, and a password
Your product and ownership information
Your preferences, such as product wish lists, order history, and marketing preferences
Information Provided From Third Parties. We may also receive Personal Information about you from third- party sources, including commercially-available sources, social media platforms, and providers of third-party products or services, and combine such Personal Information with other Personal Information that we have collected.
2. Other Information
Usage Information. Whirlpool and its business partners and service providers may use a variety of technologies that automatically or passively collect information about how you interact with our Websites ("Usage Information"). Usage Information may include: (i) your IP address, which is a unique set of numbers assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider (ISP) (which, depending on your ISP, may be a different number every time you connect to the Internet); (ii) the type of browser and operating system you use; and (iii) other information about your online session, such as the URL you came from to get to our Websites and the date and time you visited our Websites. In addition to using this information from our log files to better understand how our Websites are used, we may use this information to troubleshoot technical problems, maintain online safety and security, and if necessary, prohibit or restrict access to our online services.
The technologies used to collect Usage Information include but are not limited to:
Cookies. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies to improve your experience on our Websites, such as to allow you to return to the Website more easily, hold your shopping cart, or save your language preferences. Our third party service providers and business partners may also use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect Other Information from visitors to our Websites.
We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies:
A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our Websites.
A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. We set a persistent cookie to store your account settings so we can identify you the next time you visit or enable some functions on our Websites. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Websites.
You can delete cookies by following the directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file. If you reject cookies, you may still use our Websites, but your ability to use some areas of our Websites may be limited.
Local Storage/Local Shared Objects. We use Local Shared Objects (LSOs) such as HTML5 or Flash on our Websites to store content information and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our Websites or to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity use LSOs such as HTML5 or Flash to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs. To manage Flash LSOs please click here.
Web Beacons. Web beacons are tiny electronic image files that can be embedded within a web page or included in an e-mail message, and are usually invisible to the human eye. When we use web beacons within our web pages, the web beacons (also known as “clear GIFs” or “tracking pixels”) may tell us such things as: how many people are coming to our Websites, whether they are one-time or repeat visitors, which pages they viewed and for how long, how well certain online advertising campaigns are converting, and other similar Website usage data. When used in our e-mail communications, web beacons can tell us the time an e-mail was opened, if and how many times it was forwarded, and what links users click on from within the e- mail message. Based on this information, we can adjust the content, products, services, and promotions we provide you to better meet your interests, as well as make you aware of Whirlpool products, services, and/or special offers in which you may be interested.
De-Identifying or Aggregating Information. We may de-identify or aggregate Personal Information to create other Information. For example, we may aggregate Personal Information to calculate the percentage of our users who use our Websites within a particular zip code/postal code.
