mau5trap may work with third-party advertisers that use cookies and similar technologies to provide more relevant advertising about mau5trap Products and Services on our websites and across the internet. To provide this ‘interest-based advertising’, the parties combine non-personal data about your online activities acquired over time, which help cater advertising that we deliver to you. Examples of this may include a mau5trap advertisement on a Facebook page, or a Google-owned page such as a search results page or YouTube, or on a site within Google’s advertising network. We do not share your personal information as part of this process. Where necessary we obtain your consent to this process. At all times, you can opt out of these personalized ads from third-party advertisers and ad networks who are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) or who follow the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising by visiting the opt-out pages on the NAI websites and DAA websites. Opting out may make the ads you see across the internet less relevant to you.
If you have opted out of receiving communications from us, we will not use your email for interest-based advertising. If you have any questions about the use of your personal information, please send an email to privacy@mau5trap.com.
mau5trap may modify or update this Policy when necessary to reflect customer feedback and changes in our mau5trap Products and Service. Please review it regularly. When we update this Policy, we will revise the ‘Last Update’ date at the top of the Policy. If there are material changes to the Policy or in how mau5trap uses your personal data, we will notify you either by posting a notice of such changes before they take effect or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to regularly review this Policy to learn more how mau5trap is using and protecting your information.

Some browsers offer a “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) signal whereby you may indicate your preference regarding tracking and cross-site tracking.
