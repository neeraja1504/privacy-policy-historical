MAA TV.com Online Privacy Notice
(Revised - September 13, 2007)
Our Commitment To Privacy
At MAA TV, we are committed to protecting your privacy online. Our pledge is to safeguard any personal information that you provide us, and to make every reasonable effort to use this information only as you choose. We at MAA TV are taking a leadership role in assisting our customers and other businesses in understanding the importance of using your personal information appropriately.
Scope of This Notice
The goal of this Privacy Notice is to advise you of the online privacy practices of MAA TV.com and to describe the choices you have about the way the information collected on this site is used. It also applies to consumer digital registration cards. For information about other offline data collections, use the contact information noted below.
PLEASE NOTE:
This statement does not apply to our commercial customers.
If when you provide your personal information you indicate your residence as outside India, you may be offered a privacy notice that is specific to your country of residence. In such case, MAA TV is operating this site for itself as well as a service provider for its global affiliates.
On our co-branded sites (such as those sites where MAA TV has presented content together with one of our retail partners) a privacy notice unique to that site may be presented.
Private sites (such as those only available to dealers and distributors) and sites created for our employees (or prospective employees) may also have privacy notices unique to those sites.
Sites maintained by MAA TV subsidiaries and affiliates, although linked to MAA TV.com, have their own online privacy notices.
