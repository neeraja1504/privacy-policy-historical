May 11, 2018
This is the Mathematical Association of America (MAA) website Privacy Policy, which discloses the privacy practices of maa.org. The following principles govern our information practices and other privacy aspects of our website.
Protecting Your Information
At MAA, protecting the privacy of our members and customers is important. We encrypt the transmission of sensitive (such as credit card numbers) information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We protect your personal information from loss, misuse or unauthorized alteration by using industry-recognized security safeguards. We use both internal and external resources to review our security procedures. We follow industry-recognized standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once received. We cannot guarantee its absolute security as no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is completely secure but we are committed to safeguarding your sensitive information. If you have any questions about the security on our website, contact maaservice@maa.org.
Data Retention
We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services, contact maaservice@maa.org. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
How We Use Your Information
When we ask you for information on our website, we will tell you how the information you provide will be used. You retain the right to opt-out of communications that are not transactional at anytime.
Our Relationships With Third Parties
We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy. We do not sell your personal information to third parties.
We have limited relationships with third parties to assist us in servicing you, for example, by fulfilling customer orders, providing customer service or delivering subscription content. These service providers are contractually required to maintain the confidentiality of the information we provide them. When you request any of these products or services, you permit us to provide your personal information to the contractor to fulfill your request. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.
We may disclose your information if we are required to by a law enforcement action such as a court order, subpoena, or search warrant or similar legal process. We may also disclose your information when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.
If MAA is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.
How We Use Web Technology

We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.
