To establish an account on Maryland Health Connection, we collect information such as your first name, last name and your e-mail address.

These organizations may include the Social Security Administration (SSA), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Department of Defense (DoD), the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), and state Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) agencies.
In addition, information may be disclosed to the Maryland New Hire Registry and the National Death Registry to verify whether an applicant is eligible for or enrolled in employer-sponsored coverage and to ensure deceased individuals’ names are not fraudulently used. Your information may be shared with the employer(s) listed on your application for the limited purposes of verifying whether you are eligible for or enrolled in employer-sponsored coverage or advance premium tax credits.

When Sending You Marketplace Messages
Maryland Health Connection uses the email address you provide us to send emails about important updates, deadlines or reminders related to the health insurance marketplace, if you have given us permission to send you these email messages. MHBE uses Granicus, a secure marketing cloud application, to communicate with you via email.
Terms and Conditions for Text Alerts
These texting terms and conditions apply when you provide consent to receive text messages from Maryland Health Connection. You do not have to receive text messages to apply for health coverage. Maryland Health Connection offers text messaging as a way to communicate with you. To receive text messages from Maryland Health Connection, you must consent by providing a mobile phone number and opting in.
To stop delivery of text messages related to the status of your application and deadlines and health care benefits and general health information, reply STOP from your mobile phone.
If you want to specify the type of text messages you will receive, you can go to Manage Account Settings to manage your text subscriptions.
Text messaging from Maryland Health Connection also may include one-time texts for Multi-factor Authentication (MFA). For security reasons, if you would like to stop MFA, you must opt out in your Enable or Disable Additional Security from your account home page.
If you have any questions about text messages, you can contact us at 1-855-642-8572. Deaf and hard of hearing use Relay service.
When Calling About Your Application or Account
MHBE uses the phone number you provided us to communicate important information about your application or account. Only for extenuating circumstances are pre-recorded calls used to encourage consumers to call the Exchange. There is also a call-back feature that auto-dials consumers who opt to use this feature instead of waiting on hold for assistance from the Consumer Support. If you want to stop receiving notifications in the form of prerecorded phone calls, please contact the Consumer Support Center toll free at 1-855-642-8572, (Deaf and hard of hearing use Relay service.) for the deaf or hearing impaired, or Maryland Relay at 711, and ask to be added to our do not call list. After we update your account, a Marketplace representative may still call you if there is an issue with your account or health plan, including if:
A technical error occurred when you applied on MarylandHealthConnection.gov-you probably saw an error message when completing your application-that prevented you from enrolling in a plan or your health insurance company from receiving your enrollment information.
The Marketplace needs more information to verify or add to information you entered on your application about your income, citizenship, immigration status, identify, or something else. We do this when some information you provided doesn’t match our records. (Note: This is sometimes called a verification check list or VCL). The Marketplace won’t end health insurance or change savings based on health insurance data verification issues without giving you advance notice. You’ll get two warning notifications, and a reminder phone call for Medicaid or MCHIP enrollees, before coverage ends or your savings change due to a verification issue.
Your health insurance company is no longer offering your plan through the Marketplace.
When Conducting Surveys and Improving Services
MHBE also uses online surveys to collect opinions and feedback. You don’t have to answer these questions. If you do answer these questions, do not include any personally identifiable information in your answers. We analyze and use the information from these surveys to improve the site’s operation and content. The information is available only to MHBE managers, members of the MHBE communications and web teams, and other designated state staff and contractors who require this information to perform their duties.
When Using Third-Party Tools for Website Analytics
MHBE uses a variety of third-party web tools for web analytics. MHBE uses these tools to collect basic information about visits to MarylandHealthConnection.gov. This information is then used to maintain the website including: monitoring site stability, measuring site traffic, optimizing site content, and helping to make the site more useful to visitors. The MHBE staff analyzes the data collected from these tools. The reports are available only to MHBE managers, teams who implement State Based Marketplaces programs represented on MarylandHealthConnection.gov, members of the MHBE marketing and information technology teams, and other designated state staff and contractors who need this information to perform their duties. Tools include Google Analytics.
When Using Third-Party Tools for Outreach through Digital Advertising
MHBE uses third-party web services to conduct outreach and education through the use of digital advertising for the Marketplace. These third-party services may collect information through the use of web beacons that are located on our pages. A web beacon is a see-through graphic image (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel) that is placed on a web page and, in combination with a cookie, allows us to collect information regarding the use of the web page that contains the web beacon. We use web beacons to tell when a user is redirected to MarylandHealthConnection.gov after clicking on or otherwise interacting with a Marketplace advertisement that we ran on another website (known as “click tracking” or “conversion tracking”), and to better target Marketplace advertisements (known as “retargeting”) to inform citizens about Marketplace deadlines and the benefits available through MarylandHealthConnection.gov.
MHBE uses third-party tools to help deliver advertising. Vendors that operate the third-party tools may also gather information about your visits to third-party sites outside of MarylandHealthConnection.gov. However, while MHBE does not track your individual-level activity on the Internet outside of MarylandHealthConnection.gov, our vendors may collect information automatically collected by MarylandHealthConnection.gov (not information you provide), and combine it with data they collect elsewhere for targeted advertising purposes. The outreach and education analytics tools provide reports which aggregate data such as the number of clicks on advertisements. The reports are available only to MHBE managers, teams who implement the insurance affordability programs represented on MarylandHealthConnection.gov, members of the MarylandHealthConnection.gov communications and web teams, and other designated state staff and contractors who need this information to perform their duties.
How MHBE Uses Third-Party Websites and Applications with MarylandHealthConnection.gov
MarylandHealthConnection.gov site leverages a variety of technologies and social media services to communicate and interact with the public. These third-party websites and applications include popular social networking and media sites, open source software communities, and more.
Third-Party Websites
Your activity on the third-party websites that MarylandHealthConnection.gov links to (such as Facebook or Twitter) is governed by the security and privacy policies of those sites. You should review the privacy policies of all websites before using them so that you understand how your information may be used. You should also adjust privacy settings on your account on any third-party website to match your preferences.
How MHBE Protects Your Personal Information

If you visit MarylandHealthConnection.gov and choose to provide us with personally identifiable information through a request for information, paper or electronic form, application, questionnaire, survey, etc., we store your personally identifiable information in a record system designed to retrieve information about you by personal identifier (name, personal email address, home mailing address, personal or mobile phone number, etc.) We will safeguard the information you provide in accordance with the requirements of the Affordable Care Act and the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (5 U.S.C. Section 552a), and Computer Matching Agreement with the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services.
How Long MHBE Keeps Data and How It Is Accessed
MHBE will keep data collected long enough to achieve the specified objective for which they were collected. Once the specified objective is achieved, the data will be retired or destroyed in accordance with MHBE records schedules which, at a minimum, reflect the Affordable Care Act data retention requirements. MHBE does not store information from cookies on MHBE systems. The persistent cookies used with third-party tools on MarylandHealthConnection.gov can be stored on a user’s local system and are set to expire at varying time periods depending upon the cookie.

The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) governs information gathered online from or about children under the age of 13. The MarylandHealthConnection.gov site is not intended to solicit information of any kind from children under age 13. If you believe that we have received information from a child under age 13, please contact us at 1-800-318-2596 (Deaf and hard of hearing use Relay service).
Links to Other Sites
MarylandHealthConnection.gov may link to other HHS sites, other government sites, and/or private organizations (e.g. healthcare providers). We link to other websites solely for your convenience and education. When you follow a link to an external site, you are leaving MarylandHealthConnection.gov and are subject to the external site’s privacy and security policies. Non-federal websites do not necessarily operate under the same laws, regulations, and policies as federal websites. Aside from third-party websites highlighted in this privacy notice, MHBE is not responsible for the contents of external web pages and a link to a page does not constitute an endorsement.
Your Privacy on Social Media Sites and Other Sites that Require Registration
MHBE uses Social Media Sites in order to increase government transparency, enhance information sharing, promote public participation, and encourage collaboration with the agency. Please note that social media sites are not government websites or applications; they are controlled or operated by the social media site. MHBE does not own, manage, or control social media sites. In addition, MHBE does not collect, maintain or disseminate information posted by visitors to those Social Media Sites. If you choose to provide information to a Social Media Site through registration or other interaction with the site the use of any information you provide is controlled by your relationship with the Social Media Page Administrators in whole or part, based on a user’s privacy settings on the Social Media Site. For example, any information that you provide to register on Facebook is voluntarily contributed and is not maintained by MHBE. This information may be available to MHBE Social Media Page Administrators in whole or part, based on a user’s privacy settings on the Social Media Site or other site that requires registration, for targeted advertising or retargeting.
Although you may voluntarily contribute to a Social Media Site with the intent to share the information with others on a MHBE Social Media Page, to protect your privacy, please do not disclose personally identifiable information about yourself or others. MHBE does not keep separate records or accounting of any Social Media Site users or their interaction with the MarylandHealthConnection.gov pages on Social Media Sites. MHBE does not store or share this information. User information is retained by Social Media Sites in accordance with the Site’s policies. See each Social Media Site’s privacy policy to see how long user information is retained after an account has been deleted. Social Media Site users can learn more about how their information is used and maintained by each Social Media Site by visiting their privacy policy.
Permission for Information Submitted
By submitting this application, you acknowledge that you have permission from all of the people whose information is on the application to both submit their information to the Marketplace, and receive any communications about their eligibility and enrollment.
Privacy Act Statement-effective 10/1/2013
We are authorized to collect the information on this form and any supporting documentation, including social security numbers, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law No. 111-148), as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Public Law No. 111-152), and the Social Security Act.
We need the information provided about you and the other individuals listed on this form to determine eligibility for:
enrollment in a qualified health plan through the State Based Marketplace;
insurance affordability programs (such as Medicaid, CHIP, advance payment of the premium tax credits, and cost sharing reductions); and,
certifications of exemption from the individual responsibility requirement.
As part of that process, we will verify the information provided on the form, communicate with you or your authorized representative, and eventually provide the information provided as part of the ongoing operation of the Marketplace, including activities such as verifying continued eligibility for all programs, processing appeals, reporting on and managing the insurance affordability programs for eligible individuals, performing oversight and quality control activities, combatting fraud, and responding to any concerns about the security or confidentiality of the information.
While providing the requested information (including social security numbers), is voluntary, failing to provide it may delay or prevent your ability to obtain health coverage through the marketplace, advance payment of the premium tax credits, cost sharing reductions, or an exemption from the shared responsibility payment and you do not maintain qualifying health coverage for three months or longer during the year, you may be subject to a penalty. If you do not provide correct information on this form or knowingly and willfully provide false or fraudulent information, you may be subject to a penalty and other law enforcement action.
In order to verify and process applications, determine eligibility, and operate the Marketplace, we will need to share selected information that we receive outside of MHBE, including to:
Other state and federal agencies (such as, but not limited to, Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Social Security Administration (SSA), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Medicaid or Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), or local government agencies). We may use the information you provide in computer matching programs with any of these groups to make eligibility determinations, to verify continued eligibility for enrollment in a qualified health plan or Federal benefit programs, or to process appeals of eligibility determinations. Information provided by applicants will not be used for immigration enforcement purposes;
Other verification sources including consumer reporting agencies;
Employers identified on applications for eligibility determinations;
Applicants/enrollees, and authorized representatives of applicants/enrollees;
Agents, Brokers, and issuers of Qualified Health Plans, as applicable, who are certified by MHBE who assist applicants/enrollees; and
MHBE contractors engaged to perform a function for the Marketplace.
Authorized Representative
The Exchange permits an applicant or enrollee in the individual or small group market, to designate an individual person or organization to act on his or her behalf in applying for an eligibility determination or redetermination, in carrying out other ongoing communications with the Exchange.
A written document signed by the applicant or enrollee, or through another legally binding format subject to applicable authentication and data security standards is required in designation of an authorized representative. MHBE accepts representation via the application on the internet, by telephone through the call center, by mail and in person, with reasonable accommodations for those with disabilities, as defined by the Americans with Disabilities Act.
If submitted, legal documentation of authority to act on behalf of an applicant or enrollee under State law, such as a court order establishing legal guardianship or a power of attorney, shall serve in the place of the applicant's or enrollee's signature.
The authorized representative must agree to maintain, or be legally bound to maintain, the confidentiality of any information regarding the applicant or enrollee provided by the Exchange. The authorized representative is responsible for fulfilling all responsibilities encompassed within the scope of the authorized representation, as described below, to the same extent as the applicant or enrollee he or she represents.
The designation will remain in effect until the applicant or enrollee informs MHBE that representative is no longer authorized to act on his or her behalf using one of the methods available for the submission of an application; the authorized representative informs MHBE and the applicant or enrollee that he or she is no longer acting such capacity or has the legal authority to act on behalf of the applicant or enrollee.
An applicant or enrollee may authorize his or her representative to:
Sign an application on the applicant or enrollee's behalf;
Submit an update or respond to a redetermination for the applicant or enrollee in accordance with §155.330 or §155.335;
Designate his or her authorized representative to receive copies of the applicant's or enrollee's notices and other communications from the Exchange; and
Permit the authorized representative to act on behalf of the applicant or enrollee in all other matters with the Exchange.
The Exchange permits an applicant or enrollee to authorize a representative to perform fewer than all of the activities described in signed application of the applicant or enrollee. The Exchange provides information and notifications both to the applicant or enrollee, and to the authorized representative, regarding the powers and duties of authorized representatives, and tracks the specific permissions for each authorized representative.
Failure to Reconcile
Compliance with filing requirement.  The Exchange may not:
determine a tax filer eligible for advance payments of the premium tax credit if HHS notifies the Exchange as part of the process described in §155.320(c)(3) that (a) advance payments of the premium tax credit were made on behalf of the tax filer or either spouse if the tax filer is a married couple for a year for which tax data would be utilized for verification of household income and family size in accordance with §155.320(c)(1)(i), and (b) the tax filer or his or her spouse did not comply with the requirement to file an income tax return for that year as required by 26 U.S.C. 6011, 6012:
implement regulations; and,
reconcile the advance payments of the premium tax credit for that period.
