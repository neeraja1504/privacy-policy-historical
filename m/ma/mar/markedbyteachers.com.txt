What is a cookie?
The information supplied by a cookie can help us provide you with a better online experience and assist us in the profile of our visitors. A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier that is sent to your browser from a website's computer and stored on your computer's hard drive. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. Many sites do this whenever a user visits their website in order to track online traffic flows. You have the option to set your computer to accept all cookies, to notify you when a cookie is issued, or not to receive cookies at any time. The last of these means that personalised services cannot be provided to that user and accordingly you may not be able to take full advantage of all of the Marked by Teachers features. For more information on cookies please visit www.aboutcookies.org.
How we use IP addresses
We may use your IP address to help diagnose any problems with our server or to administer Marked by Teachers. Your IP address may be used to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information that helps us understand our users requirements.
Security
Marked by Teachers has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of information under its control. Please try and keep your log in information (username and/or password) secure at all times. If you suspect that the security of your log in information has been breached you can gain access to your members account area and change both your password and email address under the option 'Change your E-mail address or Password'.

We take specific steps to protect the privacy of children by not allowing minors (users under 18 years of age) to sign up to the site unless given permission by a parent or legal guardian (please see our Terms of Service clause 8 for full details). Parents and legal guardians should supervise the online activities of their children, and should consider the use of parental control tools available from online services and software providers that help provide a child-friendly Internet environment.

In the majority of cases, Marked by Teachers will allow you to view any information that is held about you if you ask for it either in an email or in writing. If you then inform us that part or all of the information is incorrect, we will review it. If we also believe that it is incorrect, we will then correct our records.
