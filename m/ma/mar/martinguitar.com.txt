Privacy Policy
C. F. Martin & Co., Inc.’s
Online Privacy and Security Statement
At C. F. Martin & Co., Inc. (“Martin”) we take the privacy of our customers and the security of their Personal Information very seriously. We believe that protecting your privacy is an integral part of the customer service we provide to you. This is Martin’s Online Privacy and Security Statement (the “Statement”) that applies to Martin’s website located at www.martinguitar.com. This Statement only applies to the www.martinguitar.com website.
How We Protect and Use Customer Personal Information
We are committed to protecting the security and integrity of customer personal information through procedures and technology designed for this purpose.
C. F. Martin & Co., Inc. ("Martin") has implemented a variety of encryption and security technologies and procedures to protect information stored in our computer systems from unauthorized access. We also maintain procedural safeguards that restrict access to your Personal Information to employees (or people working on our behalf and under confidentiality agreements) who need to know your Personal Information in order to provide the products and services that you request. "Personal Information" may include your name, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, and credit or debit card numbers.
Martin uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to keep others from intercepting your information while it is being transmitted across the Internet. SSL technology is the industry standard method of communicating secure online transactions and is built into most major browsers. Information, once on our server(s), is protected from unintended external access or intrusions. Only Martin employees who require your Personal Information to serve you have access to your data. Martin employees who have access to Personal Information are trained in the privacy and security practices of this Statement.
We may provide links to third party websites outside of www.martinguitar.com as an added convenience to our users. Martin is not responsible for the privacy, terms of use, or other policies of any other website or their management of information which you may provide to those websites. We encourage you to investigate and review the privacy policies and practices of any third party websites to which you may provide any of your information.
Transaction Security - Secured communications on the web involve the elements of authentication, encryption and data integrity. All three are addressed by the SSL protocol used by Martin.
Authentication is the process of establishing that you are communicating with our web server, as opposed to another server assuming our identity. We have obtained a VeriSign digital security certificate for www.martinguitar.com. VeriSign Authentication Services from Symantec Corporation is an independent third party that authenticates the identity of others on the Internet. The VeriSign certificate confirms that we are the recipients of your communication.
Encryption is the process of scrambling data to prohibit any unintended recipient from understanding it if they intercept the data while being transferred from your browser to our server(s).
Data Integrity ensures the data passed between your browser and our server is not being tampered with while in transit. SSL protects information en route to us, and the VeriSign certificate confirms that we are the recipients of this information. Although Martin strives to protect all data received, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be secure. Therefore, we do not warrant or ensure the security of any information sent to us online. To ensure you are in SSL or secure mode for your transactions, look at the address of the page. Secure pages will usually appear with an address that begins with https:// rather than the standard http://.
We collect and maintain customer information as part of servicing your product purchases and your customer relationship.
We maintain only the Personal Information you voluntarily provide to us or that is given to us by affiliated entities or third parties that have your permission to share your Personal Information with us.
