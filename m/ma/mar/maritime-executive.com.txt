Lawful basis for processing
We only process personal information where we have a lawful basis for doing so, such as the following:
User consent - This is where you have given us explicit permission to process personal information for a given purpose. For example, if you complete one of our general enquiry forms, we would ask for your consent if we wanted to use your personal information for any other purpose. You have the right to withdraw this consent at any time. You can manage your preferences within your account or by contacting customer services.
Legitimate business purposes - This is where we have a legitimate interest, as a business, to process personal information.

How we use your personal information
We collect personal information for eight main reasons:
To provide our service - We require some of your basic personal information so our services work as you would expect, for example, delivering the print magazine to your correct address, providing access to our digital content, notifying you of changes to our services and dealing with customer services queries.
To improve and maintain performance - In order to provide you with the best possible user experience, we need to make sure that our products and services work as they should.

This includes testing proposed developments on our Sites, reaching out to our customers with article comments by our readers, which remain posted on our systems.
To bill our customers - We, along with our authorized payments processors, securely process your payment information to take payments, give refunds and to detect and prevent fraudulent activity. We will also update your payment information, in the event that a payment is unsuccessful. You can manage your payment information at any time by contacting customer services. If your subscription is provided by your employer or educational institution under a group subscription, we will report how active you are for the purposes of billing.
To monitor compliance with our policies and terms - We monitor for breaches of our terms and conditions and copyright policies. For example, we reserve the right to inform the subscription holder if, through use of a group subscription, you are using our content in breach of the terms and conditions or copyright policies of our original content. We also monitor activity on our website and newsletter to detect and prevent invalid or fraudulent traffic.
To personalize our products and services - We improve your experience of our products and services by personalizing parts of our website and newsletter with the information you give us and what we learn about you.

We need to process your information to understand the effectiveness of the advertising we serve to you and others, and to deliver relevant personalized advertising. We use the information you give us and the information we collect about you to serve you with the most appropriate advertisements. You can manage your advertising settings for our websites and newsletter that carry out this activity in your account.
