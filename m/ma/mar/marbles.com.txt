13 What measures do we have in place to safeguard your personal data?
13.1 We know how important it is to keep your personal data secure. We protect your personal data when being transferred and when stored in IT systems.

Our security solutions are designed in line with industry standards to protect the personal data we store or transmit.
13.3 Access to personal information is strictly controlled. We ensure access to personal data is restricted to individuals on a need to know basis. Training is provided to individuals working within the group who need to access personal data to ensure that personal data is managed securely.

Where this is the case we and those third parties will ensure that appropriate safeguards are put in place to protect your personal information. For example, whenever FPAs transfer your personal data outside of the EEA, they impose contractual obligations on the recipients of that personal data to protect your personal data to the standard required in the EEA. They may also require the recipient to subscribe to ‘international frameworks’ intended to enable secure data sharing.

15.5 There are different types of cookies. They all work in the same way, but have minor differences:
15.5.1 Session cookies – Session cookies last only for the duration of your visit and are deleted when you close your browser. These facilitate various tasks such as allowing a website to identify that a user of a particular device is navigating from page to page, supporting website security or basic functionality. Some of the cookies we use are session cookies. For example, they help us to ensure the security of your online account servicing session, and can also keep you signed in while you move between pages or service your account. Our session cookies used for security are designed to be very difficult to read, change, access or use except by us when you have an active online account manager session. They contain no personal information that can be used to identify an individual (for example, our cookie named Identity.Cookie).
15.5.2 Persistent cookies – Persistent cookies last after you have closed your browser, and allow a website to remember your actions and preferences. Sometimes persistent cookies are used by websites to provide targeted advertising based upon the browsing history of the device. We use persistent cookies in a few ways, for example, to remember your username for log in so you don’t have to. We also use persistent cookies to allow us to analyse customer visits to our site, for example our cookie named _ga. These cookies help us to understand how customers arrive at and use our site so we can improve the service.

By using our websites you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your device, however you can block these cookies using your browser settings.
15.5.6 Functionality cookies – These cookies allow the website to remember choices you make (such as your user name).

By using our websites you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your device, however you can block these cookies using your browser settings.
15.5.7 Targeting cookies – These cookies collect several pieces of information about your browsing habits. They are usually placed by advertising networks. They remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with other organisations such as media publishers.

This type of advertising is called online behavioural advertising and those companies providing this advertising are working with the UK’s Internet Advertising Bureau to deliver more information to consumers. To highlight this information, publishers of advertising will, look to place an icon in the top right hand corner of an advert. This icon when clicked, will take you through to the website "youronlinechoices" (www.youronlinechoices.com/uk) where there is more help and guidance. By using our websites you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your device, however you can block these cookies using your browser settings.

It is a way of assessing how much you are able to afford to borrow and how you are likely to manage your account. Most lenders use credit scoring to help make fair and informed decisions about lending.
16.2 Credit scoring takes account of information from three sources:
16.2.1 The information you give us on your application;
16.2.2 Information provided by CRAs and FPAs, including information about how you manage similar accounts; and
16.2.3 Information that may already be held about you by us.
16.3 Credit scoring methods are regularly reviewed to ensure they remain fair, effective and unbiased. Using credit scoring helps us to lend responsibly.
16.4 You have rights in relation to automated decision making. Please see Section 18 for more details of these rights.
17 How do we use your personal data for profiling?
17.1 We use various profiling techniques to assist us with running our business. By “profiling” we mean the automated analysis of personal data about an individual to evaluate certain things about that individual – basically drawing conclusions about an individual based on a statistical model.
17.2 We use these techniques for instance in the course of evaluating applications for cards and/or products, to manage your account, to guard against fraud and for marketing purposes.
17.3 You have a right to object in relation to profiling. Please seeSection 18.1.7 for more details of this right.
18 What rights do you have in relation to your personal data?
18.1 You have a number of rights in relation to your personal data, these include the right to:
18.1.1 Information – Be informed about how we use your personal data;
18.1.2 Access – Obtain access to your personal data that we hold;
18.1.3 Rectification – Request that your personal data is corrected if you believe it is incorrect or incomplete;
18.1.4 Erasure – Request that we erase your personal data in the following circumstances:
(a) If we are continuing to process personal data beyond the period when it is necessary to do so for the purpose for which it was originally collected;
(b) If we are relying on consent as the legal basis for processing and you withdraw consent;
(c) If we are relying on legitimate interest as the legal basis for processing and you object to this processing and there is no overriding compelling ground which enables us to continue with the processing;
(d) If the personal data has been processed unlawfully (i.e. in breach of the requirements of the data protection legislation); or
(e) If it is necessary to delete the personal data to comply with a legal obligation
18.1.5 Restriction – Ask us to restrict our data processing activities where you consider that:
(a) Personal data is inaccurate;
(b) Our processing of your personal data is unlawful;
(c) Where we no longer need the personal data but you require us to keep it to enable you to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim; or
(d) Where you have raised an objection to our use of your personal data.
18.1.6 Portability – Request a copy of certain personal data that you have provided to us in a commonly used electronic format. This right relates to personal data that you have provided to us that we need in order to perform our agreement with you and personal data where we are relying on consent to process your personal data.
18.1.7 Objection – Object to our processing of your personal data where we are relying on legitimate interests or exercise of a public interest task to make the processing lawful. If you raise an objection we will carry out an assessment to determine whether we have an overriding legitimate ground which entitles us to continue to process your personal data.
18.1.8 Automated decisions – Not be subject to automated decisions which produce legal effects or which could have a similarly significant effect on you.
(a) As part of the processing of your personal data, decisions may be made by automated processes. This means we may automatically decide that you pose a fraud or money laundering risk if:
(i) our processing reveals your behaviour to be consistent with that of known fraudsters or money launderers; or is inconsistent with your previous submissions; or
(ii) you appear to have deliberately hidden your true identity.
(b) If you apply to us for credit but we are unable to offer you credit, you can contact us within 21 days of the date of your application to ask to have the decision reconsidered.
18.2 We will always tell you about the outcome of a request you have made in relation to the rights discussed above (except in relation to changes in marketing preferences, which are mostly automated).
18.3 If you would like to exercise any of your rights or find out more, please contact our customer services team on *0333 220 2692. The table at the end of this notice provides more details about the personal data that we use, the legal basis that we rely on in each case and your rights.
18.4 In addition to the rights above, you also have a right under the Consumer Credit Act 1974 to request a CRA to provide you with information they hold about you. A fee is payable. For more information about the fees charged please read the Credit Reference Agency Information Notice.
19 When do we rely on your consent to process your personal data?
