Personal Information that we collect may include, but is not limited to, your name, phone number, credit card or other billing information, email address and home and business postal addresses. Personal Information may also include information you supply to us that does not identify you, such as your preferences and interests expressed in the course of use of our websites and products or services, or your job title or industry, or your eligibility for special programs.
For example, we collect Personal Information when you purchase a product, contact us for warranty service or for customer or technical support, register to use one of our products, create a user ID to access services, or participate in promotions. From time to time in the future, we may offer additional products, features, services and promotional opportunities that would require you to submit Personal Information to us in order to participate. If you are unsure whether you would like to provide information to us and/or having your information used as permitted in this Privacy Policy, you should not use our websites or otherwise provide this information to us.
Navigational Information.  We also collect “Navigational Information” such as your IP address and the serial number, hardware and firmware version of your devices.
Some Navigational Information may be associated with Personal Information.
Our cloud services may collect usage information so we can manage how much to charge based on amount of use or storage, or when the limit of the services paid for has been reached. We may collect information about a Service being activated or updated, or success of update.
How we collect information
We collect your information in the following ways:
Log Files.  We may collect anonymous demographic information, which is not unique to you, such as your ZIP code, age, gender, preferences, interests and favorites using log files. There is also information about your computer hardware and software that is automatically collected by our services or websites. This information may include, but is not limited to, your computer’s Internet Protocol address, browser type, the web page you were visiting before you came to our site, information you search for on our websites, domain names, access times and referring website addresses. We may also collect information about the fact that you use certain features and functionality of our service and your responses to our surveys and research initiatives. This information is used by us for the operation of the services or websites, to maintain quality of the services or websites, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the services or websites. For these purposes, we do link this automatically-collected data to Personal Information such as name, email address, address, and phone number.
Cookies.  Like most websites, we use “cookies” and web log files to collect information to track site usage and trends, to improve our service, to deliver a customized experience. A cookie is a small data file that that is placed in the memory of your computer, mobile phone or other device by a web server and enables us to recognize you when you return to our site or log into our service. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time — for example, when you return to the same Service or Website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the features that you customized. We may use “persistent cookies” to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to the site. We may also use “session ID cookies”, which expire after a short period of time or when you close your browser. Session ID cookies are used to identify a particular visit and are used to enable certain features of the site or service, to better understand how you interact with the site and service, and to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on the site. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the services or websites. We keep track of the pages you visit on the websites, in order to determine what parts of our store and the websites are the most popular. This data is used to deliver customized content and advertising on the websites to visitors whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area.

Sharing of your personal information
We Never Sell Personal Information. We will never sell, rent or otherwise provide your Personal Information to any third party for marketing purposes.
Sharing Information with Third Parties.  We only share your Personal Information with third parties as described in this Privacy Policy, to carry out your instructions, as may be compelled by law, or as necessary to protect our rights or property. For example, we may share data with trusted partners to help us process information, extend credit, fulfill orders for our products and services, sell or deliver products and services to you, provide customer service, assess your interest in products and services, conduct customer research or satisfaction surveys, or help us perform statistical analysis.

Security and retention of your personal information
We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When sensitive Personal Information (such as a credit card information) is collected on our store, it is protected by Stripe, our third-party e-commerce provider. Although we use industry standard security measures, the Internet is not a 100% secure environment and we cannot, and do not, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit or store using the services or websites. There is no guarantee that your information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical or managerial safeguards and we are not responsible for third party circumvention of your privacy settings or our security measures. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information and for controlling access to your account.
We retain Personal Information that you provide us as long as we consider it potentially useful in contacting you about our company, products or services. We retain information about our customers for as long as we need it to provide service to the customer. We will delete this information from our servers at an earlier date if you so request, as described in “Opting-Out and Unsubscribing” below.
Social Media Features.  Our websites include Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button and Widgets, such as the “Share This” button or interactive mini-programs that run on our sites. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our sites, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our websites. Your interactions with these Social MediaFeatures are governed by the Privacy Policy of the companies providing them.
External Websites.  Our websites provide links to other websites. We do not control, and are not responsible for, the content or practices of these other websites. Our provision of such links does not constitute our endorsement of these other websites, their content, their owners, or their practices. This Privacy Policy does not apply to these other websites, which are subject to any privacy and other policies they may have. You should use caution and review the privacy policies of any web sites, services or third party providers that you visit from our websites or our products to learn more about their information practices, which may be significantly different from ours.
Public Forums.  We may offer publicly accessible message boards, blogs, and community forums. Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose any information through our public message boards, blogs, or forums, this information may be collected and used by others. We will correct or delete any information you have posted on our servers if you so request, as described in “Opting-Out and Unsubscribing” below.
