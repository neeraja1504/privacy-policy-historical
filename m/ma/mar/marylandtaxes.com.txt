Information We Collect
Let's start with what we don't collect. We don't collect or capture names; home, business, or e-mail addresses; telephone numbers; or account information unless you voluntarily give us that information for a specific purpose. If you do give us that information, we use it only for the stated purpose. We don't use cookies to track visitors to our Web site; however, for some of the interactive applications we do use them to hold your session information. Once you finish the application the cookie is removed.
Our web server software automatically logs the following information every time someone visits our Web site:
Information | Definition

Date | Date the visit occurred.
Time | Time the visit occurred.
Client IP | Internet Protocol address of the visitor.

How We Use the Information
We do not and will not sell this information or distribute it to anyone outside the agency.
We use the information we gather from your visit to help us improve our Web site. For example, by tracking how many people visit the Web site, when they visit, and the pages they visit, we can give visitors more of the kind of information they want and need. And, by tracking client software (e.g., browser type), we can avoid using features on our site that visitors cannot view or use.
Laws That Protect Your Privacy
The privacy of all tax information, including any information you submit to our Web site or information accessed through our Web site (such as the status of your refund), is protected by the Tax General Article of the Maryland Annotated Code, Section 13 - 202. The tax confidentiality law prohibits any state employee from divulging confidential tax information.
