Use of Cookies
Like many websites, we use cookies, web beacons and similar technologies to record your preferences, track the use of our products and your exposure to our online advertisements. We may also use these technologies to monitor traffic, improve the products and make it easier and/or relevant for your use. For example, we may recommend articles similar to the ones you’re reading or display advertisements that you haven’t already seen.
Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but, if you prefer, you can usually modify your browser setting to disable or reject cookies. If you delete your cookies or if you set your web browser to decline cookies, some features may not work or may not work as designed.
Some browsers make it possible for you to signal that you don’t want your Internet browsing activity to be tracked. Since the Internet community hasn’t reached a consensus on how to honor these signals, we don’t take action to Do-Not-Track requests at this time.
Online Advertising Partners
We allow third-party advertisers to display advertisements on our sites and in our products.  These third-party advertisers and related ad-serving companies may use cookies alone or in conjunction with tracking technologies such as web beacons to collect information about you when you use Industry Dive products.
We will not provide these online advertisers with access to any personally identifiable information you may have provided to us without your consent.  Advertisers may, however, use persistent identifiers to track your internet usage across other websites in their networks beyond our websites. While we will not provide these advertisers with personally identifiable information, they may already possess personally identifiable information about you, obtained from other sources, and may be able to combine that information with information behavioral data collected when you use Industry Dive products. For example, whether you engaged with their advertisement when it was displayed.
We do not control these third parties’ tracking technologies, how they may be used, or the information they may collect and we are not responsible for the privacy policies or the content of those third parties.
If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, you may so by visiting www.aboutads.info/ or networkadvertising.org/choices/ or www.youronlinechoices.eu/.

Where permissible, we will also delete your Personal Data upon your request.
