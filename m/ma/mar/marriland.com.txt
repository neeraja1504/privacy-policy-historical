Privacy Policy ‚Ä¢ Marriland.com
TL;DR Version (aka Short Version)
Marriland.com uses standard stuff you find on the internet that may track your visit to pages on the site (with cookies ‚Äî not the tasty kind).
Google ¬†Analytics so I know how many people are visiting, what state/province/country visitors are from, what pages they‚Äôre visiting, and stuff like that.
Google Adsense to serve personalized ads based on your browsing history. A site ‚Äî _with ¬†ADS¬†_on it?! Never seen one of those on the internet, am I right?! (Heck, you might even have an ad-blocker on‚Ä¶ üôÅ The ads here aren‚Äôt so bad, though, so maybe you‚Äôll be nice and turn it off here!)
Don‚Äôt like personalized ads from Google? You can opt-out by following the linked instructions.
YouTube videos, Facebook share buttons, Twitter share buttons or embeds. These kinda just‚Ä¶ happen, you know? It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm telling them ‚ÄúHey here‚Äôs this person, take all of their PRIVACIES!!1‚Äù but they just kinda do that stuff to do what they do.
Amazon Associates links will place a cookie telling Amazon that your visit came from my site. They may track it or process it according to their policies.
The Marriland¬†Forums are operated independently from the rest of the site and are governed by their own Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy, and Terms of Service.
That should be the basics. Hopefully it‚Äôs easy-to-read and has enough common sense for you to decide whether or not you feel comfortable continuing your use on the Marriland website.
If you want more juicy ¬†walls¬†of¬†privacy¬†policy¬†text, look no further, because I‚Äôve got plenty more down below for you to pretend to read.
What Data We Collect And Why
We (‚ÄúMarriland‚Äù) collect data pertaining to visits on the Website (‚ÄúMarriland.com‚Äù) in order to: better understand the site‚Äôs audience through analytics; serve dynamic, personalized advertisements; provide embedded content such as videos and social media excerpts; and track inbound and outbound links to affiliate sites and services.
Personal data such as your real name, e-mail address and street address are not collected through any first- or third-party unless you voluntarily supply this information. Geolocation data, sufficient to identify your state, province, and/or country, may be gathered by third-party services such as Google Analytics.
Country data may be used to personalize your experience in order to comply with certain regional laws, such as the GDPR for viewers from the European Economic Area to whom it applies. This information is gathered server-side using your IP address as a means to check your location. Your IP address and browser headers may be included in server logs used for diagnostic reasons.
Information gathered directly by the Website is not sold, resold, or distributed to any service other than the mentioned services. Aggregate data, such as total number of monthly users or pageviews, may be relayed to third-parties interested in marketing or advertising. Data gathered by third-party services are subject to their respective data collection and/or retention policy, as well as their own privacy policies.
This data may be tracked by using Cookies to store metadata on your browser that can be referenced and reused by the Website and its third-party services. How these Cookies are used is outlined in the Website‚Äôs Cookie Policy.
Who We Share Data With
Google Analytics
Aggregate data is shared with Google to provide analytics through their Google Analytics service. The data obtained should not be capable of uniquely identifying any user or visitor of the website and is intended to provide an aggregate look at overall viewership to the site, including traffic patterns, sources, behavior, and so on.
IP addresses collected by Google Analytics are anonymized before being sent and recorded by Google‚Äôs servers. This still provides enough geolocation data to determine state or country, but not enough to uniquely identify a given user.
You can learn more about Google Analytics and its policies by visiting their website.
Google AdSense and Its Partners
Google and its partners are responsible for serving advertisements on the Website. Unless you opt-out, these advertisements may be personalized based on your browsing history across other sites through the use of Cookies.
By default, Cookies are also set upon visiting each page on the Website to further personalize your ad experience here and on other sites in Google‚Äôs ad network.
Any personalization or ads shown to any individual viewer of the Website is inaccessible to the Website‚Äôs owner or operators ‚Äî for example, if your personalized experience is showing you ads for cars, the Website owner (Marriland) would not be able to identify that you, specifically, are into cars or looking for a new car. This information is only provided to Google and its ad network partners.
You can learn more about Google advertisement policies by visiting their website.
Amazon
As part of the Amazon Associates program, certain pages on the Website may include affiliate links to products on Amazon.com. These instances will always be disclosed with a disclaimer at the bottom of any page containing them.
By clicking through one of the aforementioned links, a Cookie may be placed on your browser indicating that the Website (Marriland.com) was the referrer. Additionally, you are then subject to Amazon‚Äôs Privacy Policy by using their website.
YouTube
On any page containing an embedded YouTube video, loading that video and/or interacting with it may share data with YouTube.
If you have an account on YouTube, playing or interacting that video may save such interactions to your account or its history.
If you do not have an account on YouTube or are not logged into your account on YouTube on the browser you are viewing the Website on, information may still be tracked for analytic purposes, such as registering total views on the video, tracking total time watched, and similar features.
You can learn more by reviewing YouTube‚Äôs (Google‚Äôs) privacy policy.
Twitter, Facebook and Instagram
When you click through to any social media links to share posts, pages, tools, or other features on the site, you will be taken to the appropriate social media site and will then be governed by the privacy policies of that service.
Additionally, some social media posts that are embedded into the Website (Marriland.com) may also track your interaction or behavior in regards to the included post, such as whether it was viewed, clicked on, whether you are logged in or not, and so on.
You can learn more about Twitter‚Äôs policies on the matter on their website.
Bitly
The Website makes use of ‚Äúshort URLs‚Äù or ‚Äúshortlinks‚Äù for various purposes, primarily to make easier-to-type URLs or URLs that take up fewer characters in their links. The two domains that are associated with Marriland short URLs are marri.land and marri.me.
These two domains use Bitly‚Äôs URL shortening service to shorten URLs and redirect them to destination pages on the Website. These shortened URLs also provide analytics shared with Bitly to measure the traffic, traffic sources, and other analytics.

Data Retention Policy
Due to the nature of the Website, any user-generated content will remain posted indefinitely, unless the user manually deletes their content using their account or requests (with verification) that their data be deleted by an administrator.
Server logs are maintained for a 60-day period and are not publicly available. These are not shared with any third-party and are used solely for diagnostic or abuse prevention reasons.
Anonymized analytic data on Google Analytics is retained for an indefinite period to monitor growth over time and understand trends so the Website can react accordingly.
The Marriland Forums
The Marriland Forums are community-run and operate independently from the rest of the Website. They are governed by their own Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy, and Terms of Service.
