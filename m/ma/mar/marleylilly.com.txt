Privacy Policy
Welcome to the Marleylilly website, located at http://www.marleylilly.com/ (the "Site"), and operated by Marley Lilly LLC, a South Carolina limited liability company ("Marleylilly" or "we"). Your privacy is a priority for Marleylilly and its affiliates and we want you to be familiar with how we collect, use, and disclose information relating to you, your computer or your device and that enable your identification (the "Personal Information"). This Privacy Policy only addresses Marleylilly’s practices regarding information collected from visitors of the Site and only addresses information collected directly through or from the Site – it does not address or govern any information-gathering, use, or dissemination practices related to information collected from you other than directly through or from the Site, such as from telephone, facsimile, postal mail, personal delivery, or other or additional offline means or media.
By using the Site, you consent to the collection and use of Personal Information by Marleylilly in the manner stated here.
This Privacy Statement is incorporated into Marleylilly's Terms and Conditions by reference, as if set forth fully therein. By using the Site, you agree and consent to the Terms of Use and this Privacy Statement.
What information do we collect from you?
Information You Provide.
We collect Personal Information that you knowingly choose to submit through the Site in order to benefit from the specified features or to participate in a particular activity. For example, we may request Personal Information from you when you create an account on the Site. You may also have the opportunity to submit other data and information about yourself and your surroundings, such as your present location or another location of interest. You will be informed what information is required to utilize these features of the Site, and what information is optional.
When making purchases through the Site, we collect information relevant to the purchase including your name, billing and delivery address, email address, telephone (or mobile) number, credit/debit card number, information on your product requests and how you are using the product, and your purchase/return/exchange information. If you are applying for a job, information relating to your resume, your employment history, your education and training, and any work restrictions are also collected. We also collect your password when you register for an account.
Upon making purchases through the Site, our website stores the last four digits of the credit card used to complete the transaction, the credit card type (e.g., Visa, Mastercard, etc.), and the billing address associated with the transaction. A payment made while using our Site is processed by a payment processor. Marleylilly uses a third payment processor called Chase Paymentech to process personally identifiable payment information. The information collected for payment purposes, such as your credit card number and expiration date, are collected by Chase Paymentech. Chase Paymentech’s use of your Personal Information is governed by a separate privacy notice, which may or may not contain privacy protections as protective as this privacy notice. Please visit Chase Paymentech’s website to review their privacy notice, which can be found here: https://merchantservices.chase.com/online-privacy-policy.
Certain aspects of the Site may allow you to post or otherwise submit photos, videos, graphics, information, comments, and other content to the Site. Upon submission, all such content may become publicly available and may be viewed, read, collected, or used by others, outside of our control, including any geo-location, tags, or other metadata in such submissions.
We may combine the information you submit through the Site with other information we have collected from you, whether on- or offline. We may also combine it with information we receive about you from other sources, including publicly available information sources (such as publicly available social media profiles) as well as our service partners and data licensors, in compliance with applicable laws.
Sensitive Information.
We ask that you not send or otherwise disclose to us your racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, criminal background, or trade union membership. Where you provide us with such information, we reserve the right to erase any such information at our discretion.
Information Related to Minors.
The Site is not intended for persons under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information online from persons in this age group. We reserve the right to delete any information identified as having been provided by such persons at our discretion.
Passive Information Collection, Use, and Choices.
As you navigate the Site, certain Personal Information may be passively collected, meaning it is gathered without your actively providing it. This is done using the following technologies in the following ways:
1. **Through your browser:** Certain information is collected by most browsers, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type and operating system type and version screen resolution, and Internet browser type and version.
2. **Through your device:** If you access the Site through a mobile device or other network-connected product, certain information may be collected about that device, including your device type, network service provider, and other identifiers. We may collect unique device identifiers (such as IDFA and AID tags and UUID and UDID identifiers) associated with the device you use to access the Site.
3. **Using cookies:** Cookies are pieces of information stored directly on the computer you are using. Cookies allow us to collect information such as browser type, time spent on the Site, pages visited, and language preferences. We and our service providers use this information for security purposes, to facilitate navigation, display information more effectively, and to personalize your experience while using the Site. More specifically, we use cookies to: (i) recognize your computer or device to make your use of the Site easier, such as to remember your locations of interest and other preferences with the Site; (ii) gather statistical information about use of the Site in order to continually improve its design and functionality, understand how individuals use it, and to assist us with resolving questions regarding it; (iii) select which of our advertisements or offers are most likely to appeal to you and display them while you are on the Site and on other websites, applications, and online services that you use; and (iv) track consumer responses to online advertisements. We do not use data collected by cookies to identify who you are. We do not allow our service providers to use or share our analytics data.
4. **Social Media Widgets.** Our Site may include social media tools, including social media widgets or plug-ins, to connect you to our social media accounts. These features may set a cookie or use other automatic collection and tracking technologies to collect information about you and your use of the social media features through and in connection with our Site. These social media tools may be hosted by a third party. Your interactions with these tools and the corresponding social media platforms are governed by the privacy policies of the companies that provide such platforms.
5. **Using Monitoring Tools:** The Site may utilize pixel tags, web beacons, clear GIFs, Flash Shared Objects, HTML5 Local Storage, HTML5 Mini Databases, and other similar technologies (collectively, “Pixel(s)”), both on certain aspects of the Site and in HTML-formatted e-mail messages to you. These monitoring tools are used for the purpose of, among other things, measuring the success of our marketing campaigns, compiling statistics about Site usage and response rates, and tracking the activities of users of the Site and e-mail recipients.
6. **IP Address:** Your IP Address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider. An IP Address is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user visits the Site, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited. Collecting IP Addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many online service providers, including website operators. We use IP Addresses for purposes such as calculating Site usage levels, helping diagnose server problems, and administering the Site.
Analytic Tools: We also use tools and third party services to collect information about usage of the Site, including Google Analytics. You can learn more about Google Analytics, and its privacy practices, at the Google Analytics Help Page. Generally speaking, Google Analytics collects information on how often users visit the Site, what aspects of the Site they visit when they do so, and what other websites users visited prior to accessing the Site. You may opt out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising or customize Google Display Network ads through the Google Ads Settings page. You may also prevent your data from being collected and used by Google Analytics by opting out through the use of the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.
7. **Location-Based Features:** We may use information about your location to conduct analytics and improve the Site and to provide certain location-based features and services, as further described in this Privacy Policy and as otherwise described to you at the point of collection. To provide these location-based features, in addition to the information that you voluntarily submit through the Site, we may also access information about your location using automated means. We generally will collect information about your latitude, longitude, and the date and time when you accessed the Site. We may disclose location information as described in Section 3 of this Policy. Some services on the Site may continuously track your location information to allow our third party advertising partners to deliver advertisements that are relevant to your current location. Depending on how you access the Site, your web browser or your mobile device operating system may inform you that the Site would like to collect your location and request permission to do so. If you allow such access, the Site will collect your location information. If you decline, you will need to manually enter your location information to utilize certain features of the Site.
If you are uncomfortable with the idea of your Personal Information being collected and used in these ways, most computer systems, devices, and web browsers offer privacy settings and options, such as disabling cookies, resetting your IDFA, turning off location-based services, or opting for “Do Not Track” features. Each browser has a different procedure for disabling the use of cookies. The Help function within your browser should tell you how. Alternatively, you may visit http://www.aboutcookies.org where you can review information on how to control cookies on a variety of browsers. You will also find details of how to delete cookies from your computer and other general information about cookies. We do not override these settings or options and encourage you to use them to enhance your choices and personalize your experiences. However, in order to access certain content, features, services, products, or benefits of the Site, you may be required to provide us with certain information. If you do not wish to provide that information through the Site or if you opt to utilize the aforementioned privacy features, you may be unable to obtain certain content, features, services, products, or benefits of the Site. Changing these settings will not prevent you from seeing advertisements and offers, but those advertisements and offers may not be tailored to your interests and needs.
