MarketSurveys Privacy Policy
MarketSurveys ("MS") is a survey research company and our use of your information is strictly limited in accordance with this Privacy Policy. To use MarketSurveys.com and its related sister sites (including MarketSurveys.com, SurveyMojo.com, YourInterestsOnly.com, ExpressMyOpinions.com, MusicSurveys.com, MovieSurveys.com, EmployeeSatisfaction.com, SatisfactionSurveys.com, RestaurantSurveys.com, QueEncuestas.com, and EncuestasdeOpiniones.com (collectively, the "MS Sites") you must register as a User (at no charge) and be at least thirteen (13) years old. The MS Sites neither target, nor are intended for, children.
Information MarketSurveys collects
The information we collect helps us ensure that our services are best designed to meet your needs. MS receives and stores information that you enter when you register on the MS Sites and on MS Site forms. Typically, these are registration forms to take and/or create surveys, contests, or other promotions. Because participation on MS Sites is strictly voluntary, you are free to decide whether or not you wish to participate in any given survey, contest, or other promotion, and you can choose whether or not to disclose the requested information. If some information is required and some is optional, we will make this distinction clear. We collect both contact and other types of information:
your survey responses concerning products, services or other subjects covered in that survey ("Survey Data");
your demographic profile, such as gender, age, income, geographic area, or other characteristics ("Demographic Data");
your personally identifiable information (including email address) and other identifying information that you choose to provide, such as your physical address, first and last name, phone number, or other contact information ("PII"); and
your IP address, browser settings, a "cookie", which is a piece of data stored on your hard drive containing information about you. We collect this to analyze trends, administer the site, track Users' movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. You can set your browser to not accept cookies, but please note that by doing so many features of MS may not work and you may not be able to participate in certain surveys. See your browser's documentation for more information on accepting cookies. Our use of cookies and tracking of IP addresses are not linked to PII.
When you create an account we will send you a confirmation e-mail acknowledging your new account to the address that was supplied us. This e-mail will give you the option to delete your account, in case you change your mind or in case you are not the one who registered your email address with MS. Please keep the confirmation e-mail, as it also contains helpful contact information.
How we use User information
Survey Data and Demographic Data are tabulated collectively using data from all respondents, and are provided to research clients only in aggregate statistical form. We do not provide research clients with your PII.
MS does not send unsolicited or "spam" e-mail. We send e-mails to registered Users and others who have given us permission to communicate alerts about new surveys, as well as send newsletters and or other pertinent information.
MS has also entered into partnerships with other online third party market research companies for MS to send their survey invitations to you that take you to their online surveys and they may provide their own incentives for participation.
This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this and all MS Sites. We work to protect your information by using Secure Socket Layers (SSL) software to encrypt your information when it is being transmitted to us, and access to data is limited through the use of internal firewalls and strictly enforced. It is against our policy to provide any customer information to any third party except as stated in this Privacy Policy. While we strive to protect your PII, MS cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. Although we strongly encourage all of our partners to post their privacy policies on their sites and to adhere to the same high security standards as we do, we cannot ensure or warrant their information policies or security measures. Thus, we disclaim any responsibility for the actions of these third parties.
Public Forums and Comments
The MS Sites may make forums, user-created surveys, and message boards available to its Users. MS does not collect any User data through such forums, surveys, and message boards. Nonetheless, please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose PII online - for example on message boards, through e-mail, or in chat areas - that such information can be collected and used by others. Such third party conduct is not within the control of MS. As a result, you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your PII in these forums.
All feedback or comments submitted to us are the property of MS and we may use this information for our own marketing purposes or to contact you for further feedback on the site.
Disclosure of User Information
We may release User or account information as necessary (1) to our partners as set forth above; (2) to comply with the law; (3) to enforce or apply our Rules or Disclaimers; or (4) to protect the rights, property, or safety of MS, its subsidiaries, affiliates or partners, our Users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection.
Of course, at some time in the future a third party could acquire the MS business or assets of the business in order to conduct their own surveys with panel members. If the MS business, the panel, or a part of the panel is acquired by such a third party, Personally Identifiable Information would be transferred to the acquirer.
How can I change my information?
If you'd like to change your account information, please visit the Member's Area of MarketSurveys.com, enter your email address and password and click "Sign In". You will then have access to change your Personally Identifiable Information. If you would like to leave the MS panel completely, send us an email via the "Contact Us" link with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject box. Or, you can unsubscribe from the MS panel by responding to an email we have sent to you with "unsubscribe" in your email response. If you opt not to receive e-mail from us we will honor your request and not send e-mail unless we need to notify you that you are a contest winner. Please note that if you have submitted PII under more than one e-mail address, you must unsubscribe from each address separately. MS will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete records from our mailing list when we receive requests to do so. Because of possible retention of a residual copy in a system backup file, however, we cannot guarantee deletion in every instance.
Effective Date of Privacy Policy
MS reserves the right to change its Privacy Policy at its sole discretion at any time. If it does so, MS will inform panelists of any such change by posting it on the MS Sites. The effective date of any change of privacy policy will be clearly marked. This Privacy Policy is effective as of March 01, 2009.
