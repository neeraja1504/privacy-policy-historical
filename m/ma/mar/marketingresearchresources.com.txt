How we use the information we collect
When you participate in one of our surveys, M&RR uses your responses along with other participants' responses to inform clients about people's attitudes about their products or services. As part of the research process, your responses are analyzed in aggregate with all the other respondents' information, and your individual responses are not linked to your personally identifiable information without your permission. We are interested only in your opinions and will never try to sell you anything.
If we collect your postal address in any survey, it is to mail any survey-related incentives. We never share your e-mail or postal address without your permission.
We use your e-mail address to send you invitations to participate in new Internet surveys and to contact you with messages if you would happen to win a sweepstakes. When you participate in one of our Internet surveys, our servers only record the time you start and finish our survey. We may place "cookies" on your computer when you take our surveys; these "cookies" are used only to ensure survey security and do not collect or extract any personal information from your computer.
In phone surveys, your phone number has been either randomly generated or selected from a list provided by a reputable sample house or by our client. M&RR is not subject to The Do-Not-Call Implementation Act of 2003 or the FCC's National Do Not Call Registry. As a market research firm, we are interested only in your opinions and will never try to sell you anything. Your responses in our phone surveys are never linked to your phone number.
How we protect your information
We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use the information we collect online, by telephone, or by mail.
We may occasionally need to share your information with third parties, our agents or sub-contractors, who perform services on our behalf such as reward fulfillment, web hosting, data analysis, and the like. When we use such agents or sub-contractors, we require these parties to comply with our privacy policy and utilize all appropriate security and confidentiality measures (i.e., a "chain of trust").
Child Privacy
M&RR abides by the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) legislated by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 1998. We do not knowingly contact children under the age of 13. If you are a parent whose child has been contacted by M&RR and wish for your child not to have future correspondences, please contact us at unsubscribe@m-rr.com and we will gladly remove your child's e-mail address and/or phone number from all future e-mail and phone surveys.
