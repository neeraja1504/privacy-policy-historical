E-mail Addresses and Their Usage
Mariner Software does not purchase or rent bulk email lists. We do ask that you enter your e-mail address on our download pages before downloading software. You always have the option to not provide your e-mail address. Mariner Software does not sell, trade or rent your email address to others. We ask for your e-mail address so that we may contact you to inform you of updates, special offers, or other software that we think would be of interest to you. When you participate in a contest, promotion or survey, we may ask for your name, address, e-mail address or other information. We know that the members of our e-mail list are very sensitive to receiving SPAM, or unsolicited email; hence we are very careful about what we send out and to whom.
