Additionally , like many retailers, we or companies acting on our behalf may collect certain computer and browser information through automated technologies such as cookies and web beacons when you visit our Website. A "cookie" is a file that a website sends to a visitor’s computer or other Internet-connected device to identify the browser or to store information or settings in the browser. A 'web beacon," also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, links web pages to web servers and their cookies and may be used to transmit information collected through cookies back to a web server.
The information collected using these tools may include your IP address, browser characteristics, operating system, the address of the web page that referred you to our Website, dates and times of Website visits, the language your system uses, and the country and time zone in which your device is located. These automated technologies also permit the collection of "clickstream data," which may include a log of content you access while browsing a website. Companies acting on our behalf may combine the information collected from your visit to our Website with other information they have collected previously. See the section below titled "Opt-Out From and/or Restrict Cookies" for more information on your options with respect to the use of cookies.
Interest-Based Online Advertising
This section of our Privacy Notice provides details about interest-based online advertising (also called "targeted advertising" or "behavioral advertising"), and your choices with respect to this type of advertising.
We work with companies that collect information about your online activities to provide advertising targeted to suit your interests and preferences. For example, you may see certain ads on other websites because we contract with a company called Turn to target our ads based on information Turn has collected, including information that was collected through automated means (such as cookies and web beacons). Turn also uses automated technologies to collect information when you click on our ads, which helps track and manage the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. To learn more about Turn, including how to opt out of its collection of information for this purpose, click here. Please note that opting out from such data collection by Turn does not necessarily mean you will not be served an ad for Marshalls, and it does not prevent you from receiving e-mail or postal mail from Marshalls or having cookies collected from our Website by entities other than Turn. To learn more about your options with respect to those practices, click here.
