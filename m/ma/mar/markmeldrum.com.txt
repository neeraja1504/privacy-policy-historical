Describes how we gather and protect personal information ( ‘Personal Information’ )
How we use and share Personal Information
Personal Information
We do collect some personal information from you, as you can imagine it is important to us to know where our candidates live (in order to plan seminars and online events accessible in every time zone) and how to reach them by email (regarding account and payment issues). The information we collect, however, is never sold. We have no third party advertising affiliations and your content will never be data mined, lent, sold or otherwise manipulated for another organization’s benefit.
We use Stripe for all online payments; their privacy policy should be reviewed by our subscribers. We do not store any payment information on our website in any format whatsoever. Period.
If you request to have your account deleted, we are happy to oblige you. Please understand that there is no restore capability, so the process is permanent.
Cookies
Not just for eating.
We do offer cookies to enhance the user experience, for example, to store your login information or to bookmark where you left off in a video on your learning device. These are the only cookie functionalities we offer, as what you do on your time is entirely none of our business. We just want you to enjoy your experience at markmeldrum.com.

It is the subscriber’s responsibility to review this Policy periodically. If we make any changes to this Policy, we will change the “Last Updated” date above.
