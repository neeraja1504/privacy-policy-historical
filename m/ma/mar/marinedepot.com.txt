Information Collection and Use
MarineDepot.com is the sole owner of information collected on this site to purchase products and services from MarineDepot.com. We will not sell, share or rent this information to any outside parties, except as outlined in this policy. We collect information from our customers to process orders and better serve you with pertinent information, such as order confirmations and order status updates. Information collected includes your name, shipping address, billing address, telephone numbers, email address and payment information, such as your credit/debit card number. You have the option of creating an account with a username and password for future access to your account information and order history. To safeguard your username and password, DO NOT share them with anyone. If you do not want to create an account (for instance, if you are buying a gift for a friend), you may checkout as a guest. You will still be required to provide information relevant for processing your order but do not need to create a username and password for future visits.
Registration
You have the option of registering for an account while placing an order with us. Having an account is useful if you intend to place future orders or use advanced store functionality, like writing product reviews. Accountholders can track orders on our website, save their shopping cart, check order history, setup returns and store multiple shipping addresses. Information collected during account registration and checkout includes first and last name, billing and shipping address, email address and telephone number. This information is used to provide you with important MarineDepot.com services such as automated order status updates via email.
Orders
Information collected during registration and checkout is used to process orders. During the order process, you will have to provide financial information such as your credit card number, expiration date, money order, wire transfer or check information. This information is used for billing purposes and to fulfill your order. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use your contact information to get in touch with you. To properly process your credit card information, we must share your personal and financial information with the merchant bank for authorization and approval. This process is protected by an enhanced security system. See the Security section below for more details on security measures and procedures. We do not share your personal and financial information with any third parties, except those specified in the Sharing section of this policy.
