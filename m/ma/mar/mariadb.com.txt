Privacy Policy | MariaDB
Effective: May 1, 2018
This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect, when you access or use any of our websites and products, when you communicate to our staff, or when you otherwise interact with us (collectively, the “Services”).
This Privacy Policy describes how MariaDB collects, and processes your information, and what choices you have with respect to the information, as well as your rights relating to the collection and processing of your information.
When we refer to MariaDB we refer to MariaDB Corporation Ab, MariaDB USA, Inc. and other affiliates (“MariaDB” or “we” or “us”) and the MariaDB.com or other MariaDB websites (“Site” or “Sites”). In order to use MariaDB Sites, Services and/or to provide any personal information to us, you must accept the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not accept these practices, you must not access or use any MariaDB Sites or Services or provide us with your personal information.
What Information Do We Collect?
Personal Information
In describing the information we collect, the term “personal information” refers to information that tells us specifically who you are, such as your name, company name, phone number, email or postal address. In many cases we need this information to provide the products or services that you have requested. Unless necessary to provide our products and services, the amount of personal information that you choose to disclose to MariaDB is completely up to you. The only way we know something about you personally is if you provide it to us. In order to process certain transactions, we may also need to collect payment information from you (e.g., credit card information) which will not be shared with anyone outside of MariaDB, its affiliates and the financial institutions and vendors used to process payments. We do not intentionally collect any sensitive information, such as information concerning race, religion, health, sexual orientation or political beliefs. Please do not send any sensitive personal information to us.
Voluntary Information
We receive and store any information you voluntarily communicate to us in connection with your use of our Sites or which you may voluntarily communicate to us in any other fashion. You may choose not to provide certain information we request from you. However, if you so elect, we may not be able to provide our products and services, and you might not be able to access or take full advantage of the features and functionality of the Site. Once you initiate a voluntary transaction, we will ask you for certain information depending upon the nature of the transaction in question. For example:
When you request our products or services, we may collect your name, job title/rank, company name, address, mobile/phone number, social media account names, and email address and any other relevant information needed to contact you.
When you contact us concerning downloads or with general inquiries, we ask for the information we need in order to answer your question as quickly and as accurately as we can. We ask for your email address in order to be able to reply directly or to ask for additional information necessary to respond to your question.
When you submit a request to receive our newsletter, we ask for your email address to deliver the newsletter.
We may ask for your name, job title/rank, company name, email address, social media account, phone number, address and/or country to register you to attend our webinars or conferences upon your request.
When you participate in chat discussions or other public forums on the Site, any information posted in these areas of the Site becomes public information, and you should exercise care when disclosing personal information.
We may use information collected about you to protect our rights and to investigate and prevent fraud or other illegal activities and for any other purpose disclosed to you in connection with our Services.
