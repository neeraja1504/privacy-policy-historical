Please note that if you disagree with anything in this Privacy Policy, you must not use the Site.
1. Information You Voluntarily Provide To Margaritaville
If you open an account with us, purchase products or services, sign up for a mailing list, send us an email, or voluntarily share information with us in any other way, we receive and store the information you provide. You can choose not to voluntarily provide your information, but then you may not be able to use certain services or features offered through the Site.
Registration, Site Offerings and Other Communications: We may gather certain information voluntarily provided by you, such as your name, user name and password, address, phone number, email address, and other information about your background or personal interests, through various means, such as: (i) the Site's account registration process and mailing list service; (ii) portions of the Site that allow you to post comments and/or communicate with other users, sign up for promotional offers, download screensavers or other software, or use any other services we may offer from time to time (collectively referred to in this Privacy Policy as the “Site Offerings”); and (iii) through any communications you have with us. In addition, we may request information about other users through our “tell-a-friend” or other referral service, which is further explained below in Section 6.
We may also request similar information at our physical locations, including our restaurants, retail stores, and resort properties. However, this Privacy Policy applies only to information collected through the Site. Information about our customers that is collected at our physical locations may be subject to other terms, policies, or applicable local laws.
Online Orders: For the purpose of processing online orders, we may request contact information (including your name, address, email address, and phone number) and financial information (such as your credit card number).
2. Information That We Automatically Collect
Like many websites, we use automated tools or mechanisms to collect certain information pertaining to your use of the Site and online activities. Information that is automatically collected may be used to help us recognize you as a previous visitor to the Site, to serve relevant online advertising to you or to analyze trends and statistics (such as purchasing activities, the number of visits to certain webpages or websites, and similar data) to improve the services provided on our Site.
Use of Cookies: We may collect information about you and your use of the Site through the use of cookies. A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on your computer and that your browser provides to the Site each time you submit a query on this Site. Cookies collect information that may help us identify you (or your computer or network) and tell us how you accessed the Site and what parts were of interest to you. This information may include your Internet protocol address, referring website address, browser type and the times you accessed the Site. Internet protocol address is unique number that is assigned to each computer on the Internet. Referring website address is the domain name or URL of the webpage you were visiting immediately prior to when you accessed, visited or use the Site. Browser is the software application on your computer that lets you “see” websites (such as, Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera and Apple Safari).
IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO HAVE COOKIES PLACED ON YOUR COMPUTER, YOU CAN SET YOUR BROWSER TO REFUSE COOKIES BEFORE ACCESSING THE SITE. HOWEVER, DISABLING COOKIES MAY PREVENT OR CAUSE CERTAIN FEATURES OF THE SITE NOT TO FUNCTION PROPERLY. YOU MAY ALSO DELETE COOKIE FILES AFTER EACH VISIT DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF BROWSER YOU USE, USUALLY BY GOING TO THE TOOLS MENU AND SELECTING "DELETE BROWSING HISTORY." SOME BROWSERS ALSO CONTAIN "DO NOT TRACK" FEATURES. FOR MORE INFORMATION, YOU SHOULD REVIEW THE SPECIFICATIONS OF YOUR BROWSER AND CONTACT YOUR SERVICE PROVIDER OR DEVICE MANUFACTURER.
Do Not Track Requests. Although your browser may allow you to adjust your browser settings so that “do not track” requests are sent to the websites that you visit, Margaritaville will not disable tracking technology that may be active on the Site in response to any “do not track” requests that we receive from your browser.
Use of Web Beacons: We may place web beacons on pages of this Website and in emails we send to you. A web beacon, also sometimes called a pixel tag or transparent GIF, is an object that is embedded in a web page. It is usually invisible to you, but allows website operators to check whether you have viewed a particular web page or email communication.
3. Information from Third Parties and Other Sources
We use third party analytics such as Google Analytics to gather and analyze anonymous user information. Google Analytics is a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”), to collect information about your use of the Site.

The Site may also link to third-party websites or display advertisements by third-party advertisers. Third-party websites and advertisers may use information collected about your Internet activity via their own cookies, web beacons, or other automated tools to track the actions of users online over time and across different websites or platforms to assist them in delivering targeted electronic ads to you. For information about how tracking works for online advertising purposes you can visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/.
You may be able to configure your browser to block third parties from tracking your activities, and some third-party companies may provide a mechanism to opt-out of their information gathering technologies.

For example, if you want to post a comment to the Site you will need to have a Facebook account and be logged in to Facebook. By logging in to a third-party social media service used to communicate or post a comment on the Site, you give us permission to access, store and use any information that you permit the applicable third-party social media service to share with us in accordance with the privacy settings that apply to your account with the third-party social media service you use post comments on the Site.

7. How We Share Your Information With Third Parties
From time to time, we may share the information we collect about you with our service providers, partners, affiliates, and third-party advertisers, if any, as follows:
Service Providers: We may use other companies or individuals (“Service Providers”) to provide certain services to us or on our behalf, such as operating and supporting the Site and its services, analyzing data, or performing marketing or consulting services. For example, we may use outside shipping companies to ship orders and outside credit card processing companies to bill for goods and services. We do not authorize these Service Providers to use your information for any purpose outside the services related to the Site or the purpose for which the applicable Service Provider was engaged by us.
These Service Providers (such as companies used to process shipping orders and credit card payments) may, in turn, provide us with similar information about you that may help us create your personalized user profile as well as other service enhancing features that we implement from time to time.
Marketing Partners and Third-Party Advertisers: From time to time, we may share information about you with our affiliates, partners, or other third-party companies so that they may send advertising and marketing communications to you. In addition, if you sign up for specific services that are provided by us and a partner, affiliate, or other third-party company, we may share information you provide to us with these third parties. For example, our sweepstakes and other promotional offers may be partnered with or co-sponsored by another company, and if you enter the sweepstakes or sign up for the offer, your information may be collected by that other company.
If you do not want us to share your information with our affiliates, partners and other third party companies for their own advertising and marketing purposes, please refer to our opt-out process in Section 12.

However, any information you submit or that is collected after this type of transfer may be subject to a new privacy policy adopted by the successor entity.
