Welcome to Capcom USA!
OUR PRIVACY COMMITMENT
Capcom U.S.A., Inc. (collectively, "Capcom USA", "Capcom", or "we") respect the privacy rights of our online visitors and recognizes the importance of protecting all information that you may choose to share with us. To further this commitment, we have adopted this Online Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") to guide how we collect, store, and use the information you provide us.
This Privacy Policy and the ESRB certification seals shown on our websites confirm that Capcom USA is a member in good standing of the Entertainment Software Rating Board's Privacy Certified Program ("ESRB"). To protect your privacy, we have voluntarily undertaken this privacy initiative and all of our websites where this Privacy Policy is posted have been reviewed and certified by ESRB Privacy Certified to meet established online information collection, use, and disclosure practices. As a licensee of this privacy program, we are subject to frequent audits of our websites and other enforcement and accountability mechanisms administered independently by the ESRB.

This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected on the websites where this Privacy Policy is posted, and does not apply to any other information collected by Capcom USA through any other means. This Privacy Policy applies to use and sharing of information collected on and after the date that this Privacy Policy is posted.
Please note that this Privacy Policy applies only to information submitted and collected online, and does not apply to information that may be collected by Capcom USA offline. This Privacy Policy applies only to websites maintained by Capcom USA, and not to Capcom Game Studio Vancouver, Inc. (www.capcomvancouver.com), our international affiliates (Capcom Asia, Capcom Europe, Capcom Japan), our mobile applications, or any websites or mobile applications maintained by other companies or organizations to which we link. Capcom USA is therefore not responsible for the content or activities provided on those websites.
Once you have clicked on an advertisement or a third party link and have left our websites, our Privacy Policy no longer applies and you must read the privacy policy of the advertiser/third party to see how your information will be handled on its website.
Finally, the terms of this Privacy Policy are subject to all applicable laws.

With the exception of your Internet Protocol address ("IP address"), we do not require personal information to access our website. However, if you prefer not to disclose personal information, you will not be able to enjoy certain features of our website. Personal information is information that can be used to directly identify and contact you.
These Websites and Children
We do not knowingly collect personal information from users under the age of 13 ("Child" or "Children"). We take Children's privacy seriously and encourage parents to play an active role in their Children's online experience at all times.

Non-Personal Information You Provide to Us
Additionally, we may also collect other types of non-personal information (known as demographic information) such as your age or date of birth, gender, hobbies, occupation, marital status, platform preferences, and other game ownership information. This demographic information may be combined with your personal information.
Information Collected Through Social Networking Sites
You can also engage with our websites on or through third-party social networking websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, or other third-party social media plug-ins and applications. When you engage with our websites on or through third-party social networking websites, plug-ins and applications, you may allow us to have access to certain information from your social media profile (e.g., name, e-mail address, photo, gender, birthday, location, your list of friends, people you follow and/or who follow you, the posts or the "likes" you make) to deliver content or as part of the operation of the application. We may also obtain non-personally identifiable information (e.g., content viewed, game performance, high scores, and information about advertisements within the content you have been shown or may have clicked on) from your interaction with our websites.
When you provide information from your social media account, it can help enable us to do things like:

Information Collected Through Technology
We collect information through technology to make our websites more interesting and useful to you. For example, when you come to one of our websites, we collect your IP address. An IP address is often associated with the portal through which you enter the Internet, like your ISP (Internet Service Provider), your company, or your university. At times, we use IP addresses to collect information regarding the frequency with which our guests visit various parts of our websites.
Cookies
Our websites also use cookies. Cookies are pieces of information that a website sends to your computer while you are viewing the website. We and other companies use cookies for a variety of purposes. For example, when you return to one of our websites after logging in, cookies provide information to the website so that the website will remember who you are. You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You can do this through your browser (like Internet Explorer or Firefox) settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser's help menu to learn the correct way to modify your settings. If you turn cookies off, you will not have access to many features that make your web experience smoother, like the features mentioned above, and some of our services may not function properly.

• Q3. How is your information used and shared?
Whatever the purpose may be, we will only collect information to the extent reasonably necessary to fulfill your requests and our legitimate business objectives.
Capcom USA Activities and Updates
Information collected from those who voluntarily submit it to us is used to provide services like newsletter subscriptions, updates on special events, game news, and e-mail announcements of interest to our users.
Forums, Blogs, and Message Boards
If you register for access to our blogs or message boards, we will use your personal information to enable you to view and post messages on the boards. You should understand, however, that community forums, blogs, and message boards are tools that allow you to communicate with members of the online community. So whenever you give out personal information in public areas, that information can be collected and used by people you don't know.
Should you wish to remove content or information after you have posted it, you may do so by logging into your Capcom account and clicking either the "garbage can" or "x" icon located on your post. Alternatively, you may contact us at privacy@capcom.com with your request. In addition, Capcom provides all registered users the ability to completely and permanently delete their account information including all comments, blogs, and forum posts. To delete your Capcom-Unity account, please log in and visit this link: http://www.capcom-unity.com/help/remove_user.one. Please note that deleting your profile cannot be reversed.
Please also note that removal of this content or information from public view does not guarantee complete or comprehensive removal. After your removal request has been honored, we may retain copies of the content or information you have previously posted on our servers. We are not required to remove your posted content or information if it has been rendered anonymous or if we are required by law to retain it. Additionally, we do not have control over third parties (e.g., other users) who may have copied or reposted this information.
Operational Uses
We may also use your personal information for other purposes such as "Operational Uses." For example, we may use your information to send you administrative communications either about your account with us or about features of our websites.
We occasionally employ other companies to perform services necessary to our internal operations. For example, we have partnered with other companies to personalize our web pages, process credit card transactions, analyze customers' interactions with our websites, and process consumer surveys. We also provide postal addresses to the U.S. Post Office for delivery purposes. While providing their services, these companies may access your personally identifying information. These companies have agreed to securely store and maintain the personal information received from us.
Aggregate Information
Finally, we may take your personally identifiable information and make it non-personally identifiable. We do this either by combining it with information about other individuals (aggregating your information with information about other individuals), or by removing characteristics (e.g., your name) that make the information personally identifiable to you. This process is known as de-personalizing your information. Given the non-personal nature of this information, no restrictions apply under this Privacy Policy on our right to de-personalize your personal information. We may use de-personalized information in any way and share it with third parties without your consent.
Business Information
For practical reasons, we treat personal information submitted to us in a business capacity different from information we receive in a non-business capacity. Personal information submitted to us in a business capacity (e.g., resumes) may be shared with third parties, depending on the nature of the inquiry.
Purchase or Sale of Businesses
From time to time, we may purchase a business or sell one or more of our businesses and your personally identifiable information may be transferred as a part of the purchase or sale. If we purchase a business, the personally identifiable information received with that business would be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy, if it is practicable and permissible to do so. If we sell a business, we will include provisions in the selling contract requiring the purchaser to treat your personally identifiable information in the same way required by this Privacy Policy (including any amendments to this Privacy Policy). The provisions of this paragraph will also apply if we are sold as part of bankruptcy proceedings.
Third Party Use
Our company does not share and has not reserved the right to rent or sell personal or demographic information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.
Disclosures Required By Law and Disclosures to Help Protect the Security and Safety of Our Websites and Others
We will disclose personal information when we believe in good faith that disclosure is required by law (e.g., court order or subpoena) or to help:
enforce our Terms of Service, or contest, sweepstakes, promotions, or game rules;
protect your safety or security, including the safety and security of your property; or
protect the safety and security of our websites or third parties.

• Q4. What are your California Privacy Rights?
Since 2005, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits our customers who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. However, as previously stated, we do not share information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. If you still have inquiries regarding our disclosure policy, please contact us:

• Q5. What kinds of security measures do we take to safeguard your personally identifiable information?
The security and confidentiality of your information is extremely important to us. We have technical, administrative and physical security measures in place to protect your personal information from unauthorized access and improper use. We also review our security procedures periodically to consider appropriate new technology and updated methods. But, despite our best efforts, no security measure is ever perfect or impenetrable. Specific security measures we currently implement to prevent unauthorized physical or electronic access to web users' personal and demographic information:
Web user data is stored behind a firewall
Data is stored in a secure physical environment (e.g. behind locked doors)
Data is stored in a database accessible to authorized employees on a need-to-know basis only
Users or employees must have a unique password before gaining access to user data
We use standard encryption technology when transferring or receiving sensitive personal information like credit card numbers
We maintain written security policies to which all employees must adhere.

• Q6. How can you update your personal information and profile?

You may update the information in your profile by logging into your account and visiting your account settings.

Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. Capcom has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access and enforcement.
