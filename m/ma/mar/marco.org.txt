Overcast
This policy applies to all information collected or submitted on Overcast’s website and our apps for iPhone and any other devices and platforms.
Information we collect
When creating an account, you will be asked to enter an optional email address and a password. Email addresses are only used for logging in, password resets, responding to emails that you initiate, and notifications that you request. We don’t send promotional emails.
You may choose not to provide an email address and have an anonymous sync account instead.
We store information about your podcasts, episodes, and listening progress to sync this information between the website and your devices. We also collect anonymous statistics about which podcasts are most popular to help inform our recommendation engine.
Technical basics
If you enable notifications, we must store a token to send them. We never use notifications for marketing.
If you upload files to Overcast, we need to store them until you delete them.
If you subscribe to a password-protected podcast, we need to store the credentials you provide in order to keep it updated.
We use cookies on the site and similar tokens in the app to keep you logged in. Our server software also stores basic technical information, such as your IP address.
Twitter accounts
If you connect a Twitter account, episodes that you “recommend” may appear in Overcast to people who follow you on Twitter, identifying you as the recommender.
Any podcasts you add to Overcast may appear to your Twitter followers in their “Podcasts You Might Like” section.
We store a read-only Twitter login token to look up your Twitter username and avatar, and who you follow. Overcast cannot post tweets, change your account, or read your private messages. You can revoke access to your Twitter account at any time.
Ads and analytics
Overcast’s app collects aggregate, anonymous statistics, such as the percentage of users who use particular features, to improve the app.
No personal data is used to target Overcast’s ads except the categories of podcasts that you’re subscribed to, such as “Technology” or “Business”. Each ad collects, and shares with its advertiser, only three numbers: total views, total taps, and total subscriptions from the ad.
Information usage
We use the information we collect to operate and improve our website, apps, and customer support.
We do not share personal information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to accomplish Overcast’s functionality. We may share anonymous, aggregate statistics with outside parties, such as how many people listen to a particular podcast with Overcast.
We may disclose your information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal requirements; to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud or abuse, violations of our policies; or to protect our rights and property.
In the future, we may sell to, buy, merge with, or partner with other businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets.
Security
We implement a variety of security measures to help keep your information secure. For instance, all communication with the app and website requires HTTPS with certificate pinning. Passwords are hashed, not stored, using industry-standard methods (currently bcrypt).
Accessing, changing, or deleting your information
You may access or change your information or delete your account from the Overcast iOS app.
Deleted information may be kept in backups for up to 90 days. Backups are encrypted and are only accessed if needed for disaster recovery.
Third-party links and content
Overcast displays links and content from third-party podcast feeds and sites, and downloads podcast files directly from each podcast’s third-party servers. These have their own independent privacy policies, and we have no responsibility or liability for their content or activities.
California Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance
We comply with the California Online Privacy Protection Act. We therefore will not distribute your personal information to outside parties without your consent.
Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance
We never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.
Information for European Union Customers
By using Overcast and providing your information, you authorize us to collect, use, and store your information outside of the European Union.
International Transfers of Information
Information may be processed, stored, and used outside of the country in which you are located. Data privacy laws vary across jurisdictions, and different laws may be applicable to your data depending on where it is processed, stored, or used.
Your Consent
By using our site or apps, you consent to our privacy policy.
Contacting Us
If you have questions regarding this privacy policy, you may email privacy@overcast.fm. Please note that account deletion should be done within the Overcast app, not via email requests, for security reasons.
