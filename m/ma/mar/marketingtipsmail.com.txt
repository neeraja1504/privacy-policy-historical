Our Privacy Pledge:
When you participate at PV as a member, your privacy is protected.
You will notice when you register at PV that we do not ask for your full name. We ask for a user name for the purpose of addressing you in emails and displaying your wins to our community on our home page and past winner's pages. You are free to supply a pseudonym on PV. We are not interested in your real name. We also do not ask for your precise address. Depending on your country of residence, you may need to supply your phone number in order to validate your account. In the US, we ask for your state, county and zip code. In other countries we may as for similar geographic and postal information, but not your precise address. We ask for your email address at registration. We will not rent, sell or share your email address with anyone without your expressed permission, except in the rare instances required by law such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process and when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.
You are able, at your option, to upload an avatar into your account. This is entirely voluntary. The avatar may be your true likeness or photo at your sole discretion. If you choose to upload an avatar, PV may from time to time display your avatar on publicly viewable portions of the website and label the avatar with your first name, first initial of your last name supplied at registration, and account winnings or cash out. Your avatar may be overlaid on a map and show your approximate registered location. Umongous will not share your avatar with Umongous Clients or associate it with any survey answers. Should you decline to upload an avatar, PV may on occasion display a stock avatar image along with your first name, first initial of last name and account winnings or cash out.
If you use a social media login, such as Facebook, your social media profile photo and name will be shared with us through the relevant API. In those cases, PV will display your social media profile photo as your avatar on PV. Your true name, obtained from the API will also be displayed on your profile page within PV. Your registration demographics, such as your relationship status, household income, employment status, etc., will not be displayed on your PV profile page for others to see nor shared in a personally identifiable fashion with any third party at any time, with the exception of PV employees who may be required to service your account. Your precise answers to survey questions and traits questions will not be displayed on your PV profile page nor shared in a personally identifiable fashion, with any third party at any time with the exception of PV employees who may be required to service your account.
We do share your anonymous demographics, which you supply during registration or periodically update, with our Clients, along with your survey answers. Although our Clients are not interested in your personal identity, theoretically (in unusual circumstances), there could be cases where our Clients might be able to determine your personal identity. An example would be if you live in a zip code with a very small population and your demographics are unique for that zip code. In practice, we are unaware of any of our Clients making this effort. Such an effort by Umongous Clients is against our policy and MR-TOS. Because our Umongous survey system is self-service, it is possible that one of our Clients could potentially violate our policies and MR-TOS and deploy a survey into PV that requests personally identifiable information ("PII"). We urge you not to answer any question in a market research survey that requests PII such as your real name, address, phone number, social security number or email address. If you see such a violation on PV, please report this violation to notification [at] paidviewpoint [dot] com.
We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy. Umongous will never try to sell you anything. We will never share, rent, sell or provide your email address to anyone else who might want to sell you anything. We are not in the lead generation business and it is against our MR-TOS for Umongous Clients to use our system and attempt to access you through PV for that purpose.
We may provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities such as delivering your incentive, shipping materials and tools, needed for conducting research, or offering customer service. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.
Your individual responses to surveys will also be kept confidential and will never be linked to your personal identifying information WITH THE EXCEPTION THAT Umongous does supply the demographics provided by you at registration and kept updated by you in your profile including state, county, zip code and inferred city or town. This information is supplied to Umongous Clients along with your survey answers so that they can make determinations about the opinions of people who generically are similar to you.
If you ever see a survey that you do not wish to answer, exit the current session in your browser and come back PV at a later time. It will be removed from your account due to completion of the number of responses ordered by the Umongous Client, and no longer appear when you log in to PV. Do not answer any survey in which you do not wish to participate.
Many of the surveys you will encounter while participating at PV exist for the purpose of identifying certain psychographic characteristics such as interests, activities, personal opinions and possessions. Umongous uses this information to direct certain surveys by Umongous Clients to you. For example, you might be asked if you own a pickup truck because a Umongous Client either does or doesn't wish to survey people who own pickup trucks.
Many questions asked in non-market-research surveys shown to you at PV are used by Umongous to make a determination about whether you are carefully reading questions and providing deliberate, consistent and candid answers. Your answers to these questions are used to determine whether Umongous will ask you to complete market research surveys. The magnitude of your opportunity to win monetary compensation on PV is largely predicated upon your level of activity on PV AND our determination of whether you are reading questions carefully and providing deliberate, consistent, candid answers. We use our proprietary algorithm "TraitScore" to make that determination. Umongous is always seeking to provide the highest quality service to its Clients and looks to you to be candid and truthful with your opinions.
Other information Collected by PV During Your Visits
PV automatically collects information and records in its database log files to help administer the site and aid in technical problem solving. Examples of log file information collected include IP address, time a page was viewed, your browser type, URL parameters, and information from cookies that were set by PV at the time of the visit. IP addresses are correlated with your declared location such as zip code. Use of proxy servers to mask your location is a violation of PV terms of service ("TOS"). It is important for PV to prevent users from creating and operating multiple accounts. Log file information is never linked to personal identifying information other than the information provided in your account profile.
Other Activities/Games on PV
As a member of PV you may optionally elect to participate in PredictionMatch and other PV contests. In order to participate you may be required to login to PV using your Facebook account. This will result in your Facebook profile photo being used as your avatar within PV, in the "top score" charts and on your profile page unless you provided a separate avatar within your PV account. That profile page is viewable by other members of PV. Your name as registered at Facebook may also appear on your profile page and be viewable by others. Once you have activated contests in your account, should you later decide to opt out, you must log in to your account and choose "opt out" within your profile settings. You may also choose to notify us by contacting PV at support [at] paidviewpoint [dot] com.
Your demographics and specific answers to questions in surveys or PV contests will not be shared with anyone in a manner that can be linked to your personal identity. For instance, your household income that you supplied at registration will not be shared with anyone in a manner that can be personally linked to you. Your Facebook login credentials are never received nor stored on PV servers. Other members of PV can see your success in PV contests.
Links to Other Web Sites
Our Site includes links to other Web sites whose privacy practices may differ from those of Umongous. If you submit personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy statements. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy statement of any Web site you visit.

For instance, if you send us an email, your name may be revealed to us in your email address, or because you have used your name in your email. We do not encourage you to publicly reveal your name even though no third parties will be able to see your registration demographics or other personal information. When we send you money by PayPal.com, your name may be revealed to us in our Paypal account but we will not transfer your name from there to the PV database.

Data Security
PV has industry standard security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. These procedures are in place to secure PV member email addresses, anonymous demographics, psychographics and survey answers. PV members may access their demographics within their profile page for the purposes of verifying and updating. Under no circumstance can one member view the demographics of another member. As with any Internet endeavor, absolute security of information transmitted through channels (communication networks, hardware, software) not directly operated or controlled by us cannot be guaranteed. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
In the event PV and/or Umongous or its affiliates enters into a merger, acquisition, sale or other transaction pursuant to which PV, or any portion of Umongous assets is acquired by a third party or an affiliate of Umongous, or is subject to bankruptcy, your personal information may be disclosed to the third party or affiliate both before and after the transaction, for the sole purpose of facilitating the transfer of your account and effecting that transaction. In the event a transaction is consummated, you will be notified of the transaction via email and/or through a notice on our website, and custody of your personal information will be transferred subject to all the terms and restrictions in this privacy policy. In the event the transaction is not consummated, PV and Umongous will require the third party or affiliate not to use or disclose your personal information in any manner whatsoever and to completely erase the same.
As is the case with any information you provide to any business operating in the United States, information provided to PV is subject to disclosure pursuant to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, or orders.
