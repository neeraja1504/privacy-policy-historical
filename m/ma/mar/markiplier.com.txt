For example, we currently use Shopify to operate this website, and Shopify uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software which encrypts information you input.
However, you should be aware that information transmitted over the internet is not completely secure because of the nature of the internet and that systems and measures used to secure information are not flawless. For these reasons, although we will use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information, including those mentioned above, we do not warrant the security of personal information transmitted to us or stored by us.  Personal information that is transmitted to us by you electronically is done at your own risk.
