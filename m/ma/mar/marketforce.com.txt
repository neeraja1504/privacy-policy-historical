Apart from the uses described in the WHAT WE DO WITH YOUR DATA AND WHY section above, we may disclose your Personal Data to third parties:
if a third party acquires any Market Force Information company, or substantially all of its assets, in which case Personal Data held by it about its customers will be one of the transferred assets and the buyer is likely to seek information about its independent contractors. In such cases we may disclose your Personal Data to the prospective or ultimate purchaser and/or their legal and other professional advisers, irrespective of where in the world any of them are located. Where reasonably practicable, we will endeavour to anonymise the data until contracts have been signed and/or request the recipient to contract to keep the data secure and confidential and, if the transaction does not proceed, either to return the data to us, or to destroy it. (Once contracts are signed, the buyer is committed and it will usually be necessary to remove the anonymization so that the buyer can make more concrete plans for dealing with customers and independent contractors).
if we are under a duty to disclose or share your Personal Data in order to comply with any legal or regulatory obligation or request, including lawful requests by public authorities to meet national security or law enforcement requirements; or
in order to enforce or apply our Terms of Use, the terms and conditions of the use of our Sites and other agreements or to investigate potential breaches; or

Privacy Shield, and you may be notified and informed of your choices relating to the disclosure in accordance with the law that applies to you.
Where we store your personal data
We use servers in several locations to process and store Personal Data, including servers provided by our third party provider Calligo (https://calligo.cloud/) which are located within and outside the EEA. Personal data of independent contractors and other data subjects located in Europe is stored on servers located in countries within the EEA which have been recognized by the European Commission as providing adequate levels of protection for Personal Data. Personal data of independent contractors located elsewhere is stored on servers located outside the EEA.
All these servers are kept in a secure, locked environment with restricted access and we have on our own, and in conjunction with the third parties who operate the servers, established physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your information.
The Personal Data stored by us may be accessed and processed by staff operating outside your jurisdiction, who work either for us or for one of our suppliers. These staff may be engaged in the fulfilment of your request, order or reservation, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services to us. We will take all steps required by applicable law to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy and applicable law.
The transmission of information via the internet is not secure. Although we will do our best to protect your Personal Data, we do not encrypt email messages and cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to the App or our Sites; any transmission is at your own risk. We have implemented a variety of technical and organizational measures to protect Personal Data from loss, misuse, unlawful processing, unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, alteration and destruction. These include limiting access to the databases to a limited number of authorized staff, who are required to enter into non-disclosure agreements before access is afforded to them and who can only access the database for legitimate pre-authorised purposes; access to the databases is password protected. We also have in place audit logs, intrusion detection software, anti-virus or malware protection and system integrity tools to further protect data stored on these databases.
Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password that enables you to access certain parts of the App and/or our Site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. You are responsible in protecting your account by not sharing your password with anyone.
Also, ensure that when using features such as social networking, chat room or forums, you do not submit any Personal Data that you do not want to be seen, collected or used by other users.
