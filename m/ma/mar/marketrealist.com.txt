To exercise any of these rights, please contact us at privacy@marketrealist.com.

For example, we store the personal information you provide on computer servers with limited access that are located in controlled facilities.
Within the Company, we restrict access to User Information to individuals who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our products or services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.
