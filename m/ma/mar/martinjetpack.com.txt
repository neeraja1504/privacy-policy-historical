We collect personal information in the form of your name, email address and location as provided by you when you sign up for our newsletter or initiate a query through the Contact Us form on our website. We also automatically collect some information each time you visit our website for analytical purposes. In all cases we will only collect your personal information through lawful means.

3. Third Parties
This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses “cookies”, which are text files placed on your computer, to help the website analyse how users use the site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. In case of activation of the IP anonymization, Google will truncate/anonymize the last octet of the IP address for Member States of the European Union as well as for other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases, the full IP address is sent to and shortened by Google servers in the USA. On behalf of the website provider Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage to the website provider. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser. However, please note that if you do this, you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website.

In addition, Martin Aircraft Company makes use of MailChimp by Rocket Science Group LLC, 675 Ponce De Leon Ave NE, Suite 5000, Atlanta, GA 30308, USA to manage its newsletter subscribers and to keep our followers informed of product changes or updates. This information is provided to us via the Keep Up To Date form on our website and includes an email address and location that are manually entered into the MailChimp system. Occasionally we may receive an email containing a subscription request. In these cases the name and address of the party who put forward the request may be captured as well as their email and location information. A copy of all requests whether via the form or by direct email are stored on our mail server in a dedicated MailChimp folder. When a person unsubscribes from our newsletter, this email is deleted.
With the help of Mailchimp we can analyse our newsletter campaigns. When you open an email sent with Mailchimp, a file contained in the email connects to the Mailchimp servers in the USA. This allows you to determine whether a newsletter message has been opened and which links have been clicked. In addition, technical information is recorded (e.g. time of registration, IP address, browser type and operating system). This information cannot be assigned to the respective newsletter recipient. They are used exclusively for statistical analysis of newsletter campaigns. The results of these analyses can be used to better adapt future newsletters to the interests of the recipients.
If you do not want Mailchimp to analyse your data, you must unsubscribe from the newsletter. For this purpose, we provide a respective link in every newsletter.
