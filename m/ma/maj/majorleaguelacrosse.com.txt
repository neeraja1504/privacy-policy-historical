We cannot collect any personal information from a child under the age of thirteen [13] without the consent of that child's parent. The statements in this Privacy Policy generally about our collection and use of personal information also apply to our treatment of personal information from children under the age of thirteen, with the added protection of the special rules that follow. Parental Consent Some services on the Website (e.g., Shop, Ticketing, Auctions) require the submission of a credit card number along with personal information, and are therefore not available to children. Other services on the Website may not be available to children under the age of thirteen. From time to time, we may request limited personally identifiably information (e.g. email address and/ or email address of parent or third party) in order to conduct online contests or sweepstakes or offer other online activities (e.g. electronic post cards, newsletters). We do not condition participation in any of our online activities on the disclosure of more information than what is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. In the event a child under the age of 13 asks to receive our electronic Newsletter or participate in an online contest or sweepstakes, prior to processing the request, we will send an email to the child asking for his/ her parent’s email address. If the child does not reply, his/ her request to participate is not processed and the child’s information is deleted. If we do receive a parent’s email address, we send the child’s parent a notification email informing him/ her of the child’s request to participate in the online activity, and give the option to have his/ her child’s information removed from our database. At any time after receiving this notification email, the child’s parent has the opportunity to exercise the option to request that we remove the child’s information from our database by following the “unsubscribe” instructions found on our website and newsletter, or by calling us at 617-746-9980. All information collected may be transferred, disclosed or shared with third parties who may be engaged by us specifically to handle the execution of the online event (e.g. newsletter, sweepstakes). These third parties may not use it for other purposes and have agreed to maintain the confidentiality of such information.
