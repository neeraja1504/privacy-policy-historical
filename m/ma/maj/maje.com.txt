What Information Does Maje Collect?
Maje collects data that you voluntarily provide on the Website through transactions, user registration on the Website, surveys, sweepstakes, or contests; that you provide to our sales associates in our Company-owned or affiliated stores; or through phone, e-mail, mail and fax interactions or paper registrations that you submit to us. In the event we conduct surveys or run a contest or sweepstakes, a set of rules or terms governing the survey, contest or sweepstakes will be provided – please read such rules carefully before participating in or entering any survey, contest or sweepstakes relating to this Website.
Maje may collect and store two types of information: "personal information" and "automatic information."
"Personal information” is personally identifiable information about you including, but not limited to, your name, gender, billing address, shipping address, email address, telephone number, date of birth or age, any personal preferences you choose to provide, transaction details such as style, size, price, discount, date, store, and an assigned password to protect your privacy.
"Automatic information” is information that we collect automatically whenever you interact with this Website, such as your IP address, the type of computer you use, and the web browser you use. An IP address is a number assigned to your computer when you connect to the Internet. Each time you visit this Website, our web server may automatically recognize and collect this information.
Automatic information also includes "cookies" and "web beacons." A "cookie" is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Among other things, cookies provide a means for us to keep track of your online patterns and preferences. By understanding which areas of the website you visit, cookies allow us to present information, products and services that are of personal interest. A cookie will not allow us to learn any personal information (such as your real name and address) that you have not otherwise disclosed. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can change your browser so that it will not automatically accept cookies. However, if you do so, it is possible that some portions of the Website may not function as intended. "Web beacons", also known as clear GIFs or single-pixel GIFs, are small image files that we may place on web pages within this Website and within web-based email newsletters that we send. Working in conjunction with cookies, web beacons allow us to accurately count the number of unique users who have visited a specific web page and the number of times those web pages are displayed. We can also use web beacons to let us know how many people opened a web-based email newsletter.
We may associate automatic information with your personal information. In the event of such association, such automatic information will be considered personal information.
Some advertisements on the Website are provided by third-party advertisers. Please note that our advertisers may also use cookies (alone or in conjunction with web beacons or other tracking technologies) to collect information about our users. We do not have control over third-party advertisers' tracking technologies or practices or how they may be used. If you have any questions about an advertisement, you should contact the responsible advertiser directly.

Any such information, materials, suggestions, ideas or comments sent to us will be deemed non-confidential, and by submitting it, you are granting us an irrevocable and unrestricted license to use, modify, reproduce, transmit, display and distribute it for any purpose whatsoever, with no payment or other compensation to you.

You may access and edit the personal information that is stored in your user account on this Website by signing or logging in on the Website. Simply click on "Login" or "My Account" from the home page and enter your email address and password to access your information.

You may also request to access, correct or delete personal information that you have provided to us at any time from our customer service representatives or by contacting us using the contact information below.
How Does Maje Protect Your Information?
We have implemented appropriate physical, electronic and administrative measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration and disclosure. When you place an order on the Website, Secure Socket Layer Technology ("SSL") encryption technology is utilized to protect your personal information during data transport. Please note that e-mail is not encrypted and is not considered to be a secure means of transmitting credit card information. While we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee or warrant that such information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our system or otherwise in our care, as the case may be, will be completely secure. Therefore, the provision of such information is done at your own risk. We shall have no liability for disclosure of your personal information due to errors, omissions or unauthorized acts of third parties during or after transmission.
When you create an online account on the Website and become a registered user, you will be asked to provide an accurate email address and create a password. You are responsible for keeping this password confidential and are urged (i) not to share your password or account information with others, (ii) to use a secure web browser, and (iii) to change your password from time to time. If you wish to cancel a password, or if you become aware of any loss, theft, or unauthorized use of a password, please contact us as set forth below.
Does Maje Disclose Your Information to Others?
All of the information that Maje collects may be shared among our subsidiaries and affiliates. Maje maintains a central database of customer information collected by online and from offline sources. When you establish or update your customer profile information with Maje, whether through a purchase, becoming a registered user of the Website, modifying your online account, or signing-up for promotional materials at the Website, our stores, through a customer service representative, or in any other communication you may have with us, we will update your customer profile information on the database.
Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, Maje does not sell, rent or trade with third parties any personal information you provide to us online or at our stores, nor do we share such information with third parties. We may disclose personal information about you to third party service providers that act on our behalf and who agree to maintain the confidentiality of such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and use the information only in connection with the services they provide. These third parties may provide a variety of services to us including, without limitation, processing credit card payments, providing website hosting and services related to storage and/or analysis of data, fraud protection and credit risk reduction, assisting us in fulfilling your transactions and customer service inquiries, updating your customer profile information in the database, marketing and promotional material distribution, assisting in data collection, or fulfilling your request to unsubscribe from our emails, newsletters and/or other promotional materials. We do not authorize such third party service providers to make any other use of your information.
We may use and/or disclose to others aggregate information about your demographics and use of our Website in a manner that does not reveal your identity.
We may disclose personal information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may have breached our HYPERLINK "http://www.ninewest.com/Terms/TERMS,default,pg.html" Terms of Use or who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property, or those of other users of our Website, or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities. We may also disclose personal information when we reasonably believe that the law requires us to do so.
We may transfer or disclose personal information in the event that Maje and/or its subsidiaries or affiliates engages in a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, the sale of a business unit or assets, or other “change of control” transaction. In such transactions, personal information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing privacy policy.
Can I Unsubscribe?
Yes. Maje honors requests to unsubscribe or “opt-out” from receipt of emails, newsletters and/or other promotional materials (including for emails that we permit other companies to send to their own list of customers or subscribers). There are several ways in which you can tell us whether or not you want to unsubscribe or “opt-out” from receiving promotional communications from us or from certain uses of your personal information. For example, (1) in emails you receive from us, you will have the opportunity to unsubscribe or “opt-out” from receiving future promotional emails from us, or (2) when you become a registered user of the Website or when you access your online account thereafter, you may have the opportunity to make or change your selections in this regard.  Please note that you may continue to receive emails, newsletters and/or other promotional materials from Maje and/or its subsidiaries or affiliates until such requests become effective – we will endeavor to respond to such requests as soon as practicable. In the event you unsubscribe or “opt-out” from receiving promotional correspondence from us, we may still contact you in connection with your relationship with us, Website-related orders or transactions, and related communications with us.
