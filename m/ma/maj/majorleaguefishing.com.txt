Finally, MLF might use various tracking, data aggregation and/or data analysis technologies, including, for example, the following:
·      Cookies, which are small data files (e.g., text files) stored on the browser or device you use to view a website or message.  They may help store user preferences and activity, and may allow a website to recognize a particular browser or device.  There are several types of cookies, including, for example, browser cookies, session cookies, and persistent cookies.  Cookies may record information you access on one page of a website to simplify subsequent interaction with that website, or to help streamline your transactions on related pages of that website.  Most major browsers are set up so that they will initially accept cookies, but you might be able to adjust your browser’s or device’s preferences to issue you an alert when a cookie is downloaded, or to block, reject, disable, delete or manage the use of some or all cookies on your browser or device.
·      Flash cookies, which are cookies written using Adobe Flash, and which may be permanently stored on your device.  Like regular cookies, Flash cookies may help store user preferences and activity, and may allow a website to recognize a particular browser or device.  Flash cookies are not managed by the same browser settings that are used for regular cookies.

Please be advised that if you choose to block, reject, disable, delete or change the management settings for any or all of the aforementioned technologies and/or other tracking, data aggregation and data analysis technologies, then certain areas of the Site and/or the ScoreTrackerLive App might not function properly.
