UCLA Extension: Privacy Policy
About the Information We Collect for Enrollment
Online registration requires that some personal information and payment card information be transmitted via the web by you to us, and subsequently by us to others with a need to know such as our acquiring bank. Furnishing all information designated by an asterisk as required on the forms on this site is a condition of enrollment. (Date of birth, gender, Social Security number (SSN)/Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), and ethnic identity are not required fields.) Failure to provide required information will delay or may even prevent your enrollment.
If you do not have or could not provide us with your SSN/TIN, you will be permitted to enroll; however, UCLA Extension will not be able to provide the IRS with evidence of fee payments that might entitle you to tax credits provided under the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. Each year in December, UCLA Extension will conduct an annual solicitation of students whose records are subject to IRS reporting but where the SSN/TIN field remains blank, this to ensure that an oversight on your part can be addressed. You may append your record online at any time by logging in to MyExtension , or submit IRS form W-9S by mail to UCLA Extension Records Office, 10995 Le Conte Avenue Room 113, Los Angeles, CA 90024.
UCLA Extension routinely reports its student census to the National Student Clearinghouse. Those seeking deferments for repayment of student loans may wish to provide SSN to expedite the deferment process.
Consistent with California practice for amending tax returns, UCLA Extensionâ€™s interest in retaining SSN for reporting purposes expires four years beyond the tax year. If still on file four years after your last enrollment, the first five characters of your SSN will be automatically expunged, leaving only the last four as an optional record identifier. SSN data are stored in an encrypted state. You may request at any time to have either or both elements of your SSN data deleted.
Contact information furnished on these forms may be used by University departments and publicly announced program co-sponsors for distribution of information on future programs and activities of interest to you. This and other information will be transmitted to the state and federal government if required by law. Except for sharing with other University departments and program co-sponsors, as provided by law UCLA Extension does not sell or share its mailing list.
