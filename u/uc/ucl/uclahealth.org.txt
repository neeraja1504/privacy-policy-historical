Eff. Date: April 14, 2003
(current-to-date)
---|---
This notice describes how medical information about you may be used and disclosed and how you can get access to this information. Please review it carefully.
UCLA HEALTH SYSTEM
UCLA Health SystemÂ is one of the health care components of the University of California. The University of California health care components consist of the UC medical centers, the UC medical groups, clinics and physician offices, the UC schools of medicine and other UC health professions schools, the student health service areas, employee health units, and the administrative and operational units that are part of the health care components of the University of California.
The University of California, including UCLA Health System, is a teaching and research institution. All patient care is overseen and supervised by an attending physician and provided by a team of health care professionals. Residents, fellows, students and graduate students of health care professions schools may participate in examinations or procedures and in the care of patients as a part of the health care education programs of the institution.
This Notice applies to information and records regarding your health care maintained at UCLA Health System.
OUR PLEDGE REGARDING YOUR MEDICAL INFORMATION
UCLA Health System is committed to protecting medical information about you. We create a record of the care and services you receive at UCLA Health System for use in your care and treatment.
This Notice tells you about the ways in which we may use and disclose medical information about you. It also describes your rights and certain obligations we have regarding the use and disclosure of your medical information.
We are required by law to:
make sure that your medical information is protected;
give you this Notice describing our legal duties and privacy practices with respect to medical information about you; and
follow the terms of the Notice that is currently in effect.
HOW WE MAY USE AND DISCLOSE MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU
The following sections describe different ways that we may use and disclose your medical information. For each category of uses or disclosures we will describe them and give some examples. Some information such as certain drug and alcohol information, HIV information and mental health information is entitled to special restrictions related to its use and disclosure. UCLA Health System abides by all applicable state and federal laws related to the protection of this information. Not every use or disclosure will be listed. All of the ways we are permitted to use and disclose information, however, will fall within one of the following categories.
For Treatment. We may use medical information about you to provide you with medical treatment or services. We may disclose medical information about you to doctors, nurses, technicians, students, or other health system personnel who are involved in taking care of you in the health system. For example, a doctor treating you for a broken leg may need to know if you have diabetes because diabetes may slow the healing process. In addition, the doctor may need to tell the hospital's food service if you have diabetes so that we can arrange for appropriate meals. We may also share medical information about you with other UCLA Health System personnel or non-UCLA Health System providers, agencies or facilities in order to provide or coordinate the different things you need, such as prescriptions, lab work and x-rays. We also may disclose medical information about you to people outside UCLA Health System who may be involved in your continuing medical care after you leave UCLA Health System such as other health care providers, transport companies, community agencies and family members.
For Payment. We may use and disclose medical information about you so that the treatment and services you receive at UCLA Health System or from other entities, such as an ambulance company, may be billed to and payment may be collected from you, an insurance company or a third party. For example, we may need to give information to your health plan about surgery you received at UCLA Health System so your health plan will pay us or reimburse you for the surgery. We may also tell your health plan about a proposed treatment to determine whether your plan will cover the treatment.
For Health Care Operations. We may use and disclose medical information about you for UCLA Health System operations. These uses and disclosures are made for quality of care and medical staff activities, UCLA Health System health sciences education, and other teaching programs. Your medical information may also be used or disclosed to comply with law and regulation, for contractual obligations, patients' claims, grievances or lawsuits, health care contracting, legal services, business planning and development, business management and administration, the sale of all or part of UCLA Health System to another entity, underwriting and other insurance activities and to operate the health system. For example, we may review medical information to find ways to improve treatment and services to our patients. We may also disclose information to doctors, nurses, technicians, medical and other students, and other health system personnel for performance improvement and educational purposes.
Appointment Reminders. We may contact you to remind you that you have an appointment at UCLA Health System.
Treatment Alternatives. We may tell you about or recommend possible treatment options or alternatives that may be of interest to you.
Health-Related Benefits and Services. We may contact you about benefits or services that we provide.
Fundraising Activities. We may contact you to provide information about UCLA Health System sponsored activities, including fundraising programs and events. We would only use contact information, such as your name, address and phone number and the dates you received treatment or services at UCLA Health System.
News Gathering Activities. A member of your health care team may contact you or one of your family members to discuss whether or not you want to participate in a media or news story. News reporters often seek interviews with patients injured in accidents or experiencing particular medical conditions or procedures. For example, a reporter working on a story about a new cancer therapy may ask whether any of the patients undergoing that therapy might be willing to be interviewed.
Hospital Directory. If you are hospitalized, we may include certain limited information about you in the hospital directory. This is so your family, friends and clergy can visit you in the hospital and generally know how you are doing. This information may include your name, location in the hospital, your general condition (e.g., fair, stable, etc.) and your religious affiliation. The directory information, except for your religious affiliation, may also be released to people who ask for you by name. Your religious affiliation may be given to members of the clergy, such as ministers or rabbis, even if they don't ask for you by name. You may restrict or prohibit the use or disclosure of this information by notifying the Director of Patient Access Services.
Individuals Involved in Your Care or Payment for Your Care. We may release medical information to anyone involved in your medical care, e.g., a friend, family member, personal representative, or any individual you identify. We may also give information to someone who helps pay for your care. We may also tell your family or friends about your general condition and that you are in the hospital.
Disaster Relief Efforts. We may disclose medical information about you to an entity assisting in a disaster relief effort so that your family can be notified about your condition, status and location.
Research. The University of California is a research institution. All research projects conducted by the University of California must be approved through a special review process to protect patient safety, welfare and confidentiality. Your medical information may be important to further research efforts and the development of new knowledge. We may use and disclose medical information about our patients for research purposes, subject to the confidentiality provisions of state and federal law.
On occasion, researchers contact patients regarding their interest in participating in certain research studies. Enrollment in those studies can only occur after you have been informed about the study, had an opportunity to ask questions, and indicated your willingness to participate by signing a consent form. When approved through a special review process, other studies may be performed using your medical information without requiring your consent. These studies will not affect your treatment or welfare, and your medical information will continue to be protected. For example, a research study may involve a chart review to compare the outcomes of patients who received different types of treatment.
As Required By Law. We will disclose medical information about you when required to do so by federal or state law.
To Avert a Serious Threat to Health or Safety. We may use and disclose medical information about you when necessary to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to your health and safety or the health and safety of the public or another person. Any disclosure would be to someone able to help stop or reduce the threat.
Organ and Tissue Donation. If you are an organ donor, we may release medical information to organizations that handle organ procurement or organ, eye or tissue transplantation or to an organ donation bank, as necessary to facilitate organ or tissue donation and transplantation.
