All (90%) of your web pages (html) must be 'linked' with files (.GIF, .JPEG, etc.) stored on UCVHost Technologies's server. Web sites that are found to contain either/or no html documents, a large number of unlinked files are subject to warning, suspension or cancellation at the discretion of UCVHost Technologies management. Any customer who violates UCVHost Technologies's Policies in abusing either space/site transfer will be notified and given 2 days to remedy the problem. If the problem is not resolved within the allotted period, the client will be billed for the overages.
To maintain the integrity of our service the following limitations apply:
Sites with banners, graphics or cgi scripts running from their domain used on other domains. Sites with picture galleries (This is any site where 50% of the files transferred is graphics) Sites offering download files or archives. (This is any site where 50% or more of there monthly traffic is from file downloads). Sites using more than 30% of system resources for longer than 60 seconds. Sites running multimedia files (QuickTime, Real Audio, Real Video, MP3).
Unsolicited Email (Spam)
Unsolicited commercial advertisements are not allowed in e-mail, and will likely result in account suspension or cancellation. Commercial advertisements are unwelcome in most Usenet discussion groups and on most e-mail mailing lists. Inappropriate posting may result in account suspension or cancellation. See the newsgroup or mailing list's charter for whether advertising is allowed or not. "Spamming," or sending a message to many different off-topic newsgroups, is particularly unethical and will be treated as such. Sending a message, especially an advertisement, to more than five or six recipients, is by itself spamming unless the individuals have specifically requested to be added to a mailing list on that topic. E-mail is a person-to-person medium, not a broadcast medium. Upon your first Spam offense your mail will be disabled for 72 hours. Upon your second Spam offense your entire domain will be disabled for 72 hours and you will be fined Rs.300.00 per sent Spam.

Chat Rooms
We do not allow clients to install their own chat rooms, without approving it with the UCVHost Technologies Support Team. Most chat rooms tend to be large system hogs and we cannot allow it as an account option. However, we do provide a choice of Java chat rooms for a small extra charge that will more than fill your needs and run without hindering the performance of the machine for others. Note: Parachat chat rooms do not apply to this rule. They are perfectly fine to install.
Abuse of SMTP Mail Server
We only allow our clients to use our SMTP server without using any illegal techniques and any unauthorised use of our SMTP server such as spam mail is not allowed.
