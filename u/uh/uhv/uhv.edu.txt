We use cookies and other technologies to learn how to improve the quality of our online service to you.

You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies.
If you send us an electronic mail message with a question or comment that contains personally-identifying information, or fill out a form that submits this information to us electronically, we may combine the information collected from you with information available within the university or from third parties to provide you with better service. We may redirect your message to another government agency or person who is in a better position to answer your question.
For site management functions, information is collected for analysis and statistical purposes. We do not report or use this information in any manner that would reveal personally identifiable information, and will not release it to any outside parties unless legally required to do so in connection with law enforcement investigations or other legal proceedings.
We use log analysis tools to create summary statistics, which are used for purposes such as assessing what information is of most interest, determining technical design specifications, and identifying system performance or problem areas.
