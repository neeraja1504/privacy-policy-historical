We take your privacy very seriously, and this Privacy Policy explains the ways in which we collect, use, disclose, and protect information relating to our Site and Services. By visiting the Site or by using the Services, you accept the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy may be amended at any time, with or without notice or notification, so we recommend periodically reviewing it. Continued use of the Site or Services following the posting of any change to this Privacy Policy constitutes acceptance of all changes. We suggest printing or saving a local copy of this Privacy Policy for your records.
Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning assigned them in our Terms of Service, “General Terms” section, found at http://unbounce.com/terms-of-service/.
Information We Collect Directly from You
We collect different types of information from or through the Site and/or Services. Where appropriate, the legal basis for our processing of Personal Data is either consent, where we ask for it, or that the processing is necessary for providing the Site and/or Services and is carried out in our legitimate interests, which are further explained in the “How We May Use Information We Collect from You” section.
Account Information : When you sign up for an Unbounce Account, you select a User ID (by entering an email address and password) and we collect and store that information. Collected information is data we have solicited in a form or obtained via cookies or by other means; stored information is collected information that has been subsequently deposited into our databases after collection. In addition to your User ID, we also collect and store your first name and last name. We may also collect and store your company name, telephone number, address, and certain other information about you that may be required by us to provide the Services or be disclosed by you during your use of the Services.
Billing Information : When your Account includes a Subscription, we collect, but do not store, your credit card number. When you enter your credit card number, it is sent directly into Recurly, our Third Party payment provider, and bypasses our databases entirely. From there, Recurly transfers Billing Information to Stripe for payment processing. You agree that our Third Party payment providers and processors may collect and store your billing address and credit card information on our behalf, and that we may change our payment provider and processor at any time for any reason.
Unbounce will collect and store your billing address. Full credit card numbers are never visible to Unbounce employees or contractors, and we will not modify your credit card number or billing address under any circumstances. We adhere to all controls required for handling cardholder data in accordance with Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliance standards. You agree that our Third Party payment processors may collect and store your billing address and credit card information on our behalf. We only use Third Parties providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures.
Log Data : When you use the Services, our servers may automatically collect and store information, including information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. This log data may include, but is not limited to, your Internet Protocol (IP) address, the address of the web page you visited before using the Services, the operating system you are using, the date and time of your accessing the Services, geolocation information, type of device, cookie data, and browser signatures.
IP Addresses : We will log the IP address of any visitor to a webpage you create and publish using the Services in order to calculate traffic usage per Account and conversion rates per variant, investigate spam allegations and discrepancies in page statistics, as well as to ensure the security of the webpage, Services, and related data. Unbounce never uses the IP address or other Personal Data of visitors to your pages to conduct marketing activities or promote the Services.
Cookies and Log Files : Cookies are small amounts of data that are transferred to your web browser by a web server and are used to collect and store information about a user. The ways we use cookies include, but are not limited to: tracking which webpage variant a visitor has seen, monitoring traffic patterns, and gauging the popularity of service options. Cookies also allow us to ensure that visitors see the webpage variant they expect to see if they return to the same website URL, and to calculate total visits and views per webpage, variant, Account, and client sub-account. First-party cookies on Unbounce landing pages are anonymous and cannot be used on their own to identify an individual.
Use of the Site and Services signifies consent to Unbounce’s use of cookies, including and without limitation Third Party cookies that Unbounce may choose to use for analytics or other purposes. You agree that should you disable cookies on your browser, certain aspects of the Services may be unavailable to you, and that Unbounce is not responsible for any adverse effects arising from your browser or other computer or mobile settings.
You agree that you are responsible for adhering to all laws, policies, and other regulations in your relevant jurisdiction(s), including but not limited to all laws requiring that cookie use must be disclosed. Unbounce disclaims all liability in this area.
User Contributions : You may also provide information to be published or displayed on public areas of the Site and/or Services, or transmitted to other users of the Site and/or Services (collectively, “User Contributions”). Your User Contributions are posted and transmitted to others at your own risk. We cannot control the actions of other users of the Site with whom you may choose to share your User Contributions. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that your User Contributions will not be viewed by unauthorized persons.
Lead Data : You have the option of using the Unbounce platform to build forms and solicit information from individual data subjects (“Lead Data”). In these situations, since you choose which data to collect and process, the nature of the data, as well as the purposes and means of processing, you are acting as “Data Controller” under applicable laws (including, but not limited to, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”)) and you have the associated responsibilities under these applicable laws.
By maintaining an Account with us, you voluntarily consent to the collection, storage, use, and disclosure of Personal Data as specified in this Privacy Policy. Without limiting the foregoing, we may on occasion ask you to consent when we collect, store, use, or disclose your Personal Data in specific circumstances. These circumstances may include, but are not limited to, Trial Programs, Beta Tests, research and development, and other changes, updates, or additions to the Services.
WordPress Plugin : You have the option of adding a “WordPress Domain” to your account. A WordPress Domain is a domain you have purchased from a hosting provider or domain name seller and onto which you have installed wordpress.org software. In order to publish Unbounce webpages to your WordPress Domain, you will need to install Unbounce’s Plugin for WordPress (“the Plugin”) in your WordPress account.
When installing or updating the Plugin, Unbounce will collect and store certain data from your WordPress environment. This data includes, but is not limited to: WordPress version number, PHP version number, cURL version number, the names of other WordPress plugins installed on your domain, the names of other PHP extensions installed on your domain, your operating system, and key PHP configuration settings.
We are collecting this information in order to better support the Plugin and the environments on to which it is installed. Among other things, we will collect and store this data in order to inform our decisions on minimum configuration and testing requirements, and to improve the stability of Plugin updates.
You hereby consent to the collection and storage of this information in your use, installation and updating of the Plugin. If you do not consent to the collection and storage of this information, you may not use the Plugin.
How We May Use Information We Collect from You
We take steps designed to ensure that only those employees who need access to your Personal Data to fulfill their employment duties will have access to it.

We may use your Personal Data to generate Aggregated Data for internal use and for sharing with Third Parties on a selective basis.
