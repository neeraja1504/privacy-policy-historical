At Ideal Health, we believe that understanding what our customers want for products, services and information is an important part of building an interesting and useful online environment.

We have restricted our Marketing Representative from using your personal information in any way other than to provide you with more information about products & services that Ideal Health offers.
Any information that is sent to Metametrix® Clinical Laboratory, is also held in confidence as well, and IS NOT shared with your Marketing Representative.
