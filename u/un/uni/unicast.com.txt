Data Collection through Sizmek Services
Sizmek's technology may be deployed on other websites to collect information that may be used for online ad tailoring purposes or to deliver an advertisement to you from a company whose website you have visited in the past.  Sizmek's technology may employ cookies to collect non-personally identifying information, such as information related to advertising campaign results, in the course of providing its clients with its ad-serving services and for the purpose of helping its clients determine which advertisement is suitable to be delivered to you.  This non-personally identifiable information collected through a cookie may be shared with our customers for their advertising purposes and may be combined by them with other data, including personal information, in possession of our customers.

The Opt-Out Cookie & Your Choices
Sizmek allows consumers to opt out of having online ads tailored using the Sizmek ad-serving cookie. Blocking and/or opting out of cookies does not stop advertisements from being served to your computer; rather, it prevents data from being associated with your browser. Please note that if you choose an opt-out cookie, we will be unable to recognize your browser from one visit to the next, and you may therefore receive the same ad multiple times.
