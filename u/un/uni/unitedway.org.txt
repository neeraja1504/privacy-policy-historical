Privacy Policy | United Way
Our General Policy
United Way Worldwide (UWW) recognizes the importance of protecting information we may collect from visitors to our site. Our policy is to use the information we acquire from visitors to our sites for internal purposes only, and we maintain appropriate security measures to keep this information private. The only exception is "Postings" which is discussed above. Your browser, however, does automatically tell us the type of computer and operating system you are using.
Users can visit the site without revealing any information about themselves. If one chooses to give us personal information via the Internet for the purposes of correspondence, processing an order, or providing a subscription to a publication, then it is our intent to let you know how we will use such information.
If users tell us that they do not wish to have this information used as a basis for further contact, we will respect those wishes. We do keep track of the domains from which people visit us. We analyze this data for trends, insights and statistics, and then we discard it. Information may be maintained on an opt in basis only for receipt of communication and products from United Way. Only users of 13 years or older can opt in.
UWW takes precautions to keep the user information disclosed to us secure, and such information will not be disclosed to third parties for commercial purposes. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and to ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect.  UWW uses SSL encryption for all financial transactions to protect personal information.
If you provide an email address or other personal information (excluding financial information) when you visit our site,  we may enter such information into one of our data bases so we can contact you to ask your input,  provide information about our programs and events, and request contributions.  We may also share your information with your Local United Way to be used solely for the foregoing specified purposes. If you would like us to withhold your information from such an exchange, please contact us.
Use of Cookies
Certain sections of the UWA web site use "cookies" to store user information. A cookie is a small string of text that a web site can send to your browser. A cookie cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive, pass on computer viruses, or capture your email address. Currently, web sites use cookies to enhance the user's visit; in general, cookies can securely store a user's ID and password, personalize home pages, identify which parts of a site have been visited, or keep track of selections in a "shopping cart." Cookies help us understand which parts of our web sites are the most popular, where our visitors are going, and how long they spend there. We use cookies to study traffic patterns on our site so we can make the site even better.
Cookies were originally designed to help a web site distinguish a user's browser as a previous visitor and thus save and remember any preferences that may have been set while the user was browsing the site. If you are just browsing UWW's web site, a cookie identifies only your browser. If you become a registered user on a UWA web site (with a user ID and password), we may use cookies so that we can provide personalized information that we believe will be of value to you based on preferences you have indicated while visiting the site. It is possible to set your browser to inform you when a cookie is being placed - this way, you have the opportunity to decide whether to accept the cookie. If you are just browsing our site and are not a registered user, you do not have to accept a cookie and you can still continue browsing the site. However, if you are visiting a site where you will be accessing a confidential account, you must accept that site's cookies because they are essential for site administration and security.
User Agreement
If you have any questions about this User Agreement, contact UWW. If you do not agree with these terms of this User Agreement, you may not use the site. UWW reserves the right to change this User Agreement at any time without notice.
