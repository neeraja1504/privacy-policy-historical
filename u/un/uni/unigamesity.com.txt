They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content you see. However, no other Personal Information (such as name, e-mail, address etc) is collected or required in such circumstances. When it comes to Google advertising, users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy.
