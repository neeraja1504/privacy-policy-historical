Privacy Statement
The Union Leader Corporation and its affiliates collect, use, store, and share information obtained from users of UnionLeader.com and NewHampshire.com (referred to in this policy as "Union Leader").
Union Leader collects information from users at several different points on our websites. For example, we request personal information from users at the time of any registration and on order forms such as subscriptions, wherein a user provides information such as name, address, e-mail address, phone number, credit card or other billing information.
UnionLeader.com does not provide credit card or billing information to outside third parties, other than as necessary for credit card and billing processing by service providers prohibited from using the information provided to them in any other way, or sharing or selling the information.
Union Leader may share personal information with third party vendors and service providers like email distributors, list processors, analysts, and promoters. Only information necessary for these third parties’ services is provided, and they are prohibited from sharing or reselling the information.
Personal information such as name, address, email, and telephone number may also be shared with our partners and advertisers in connection with promotions such as contests, sweepstakes, or special offers, should you decide to participate in such promotions or contests.
Union Leader uses personal information to communicate with you. You may receive e-mail messages alerting you when the website is updated with breaking news, or other information or offers that may be of interest to you. You can opt out of this service at any time by sending a message to the webmaster.
Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on Union Leader Corporation and relating to our Web site.
Union Leader may also collect and share with third parties like vendors, service providers, advertisers, and marketing partners aggregate information such as age, town, ZIP code, gender, whether you read the print edition, and other non-personal information about the device or computer used to access our sites, such as IP address, browser type, browsing history, language, and other transactional information, including geolocation information. This helps us provide useful content and services and it gives our advertisers, who make this site possible, a better understanding of who they reach by advertising with Union Leader.
For example, visitor traffic is logged so we can count user sessions, identify our customer base and make improvements to meet user preferences. Non-personal information is collected to help us better serve our readers and advertisers. Clicks from an advertiser's banner or tile to that advertiser's website are logged and reported to the advertiser. No personally identifiable information is collected in these operations.
