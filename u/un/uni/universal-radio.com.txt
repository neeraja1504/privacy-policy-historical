The Way We Use Information:
We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order only to complete that order. We do not share this information with outside parties or other companies.

We do not permanently store credit card information. This information is periodically purged. CID numbers are not stored electronically.
Our Commitment To Children's Privacy:
Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13. There is no adult material on our website.
