Introduction - Our Commitment to You
HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A. ("HSBC", "we", "us", or "our") is the proud issuer of The Union Plus Credit Card. HSBC is proud to be part of a financial services organization that has been providing superior products and services for more than 150 years. We greatly appreciate the trust that you and millions of customers have placed in us, and we protect that trust by continuing to respect the privacy of all our applicants and customers even if our formal customer relationship ends.
This Privacy Statement illustrates our commitment to your privacy and explains our privacy practices to help you understand how we protect and use your information.
We may change our privacy practices at any time as permitted by law, and if we do so, we will provide you with notice as required. If you have selected a credit-related insurance product, the Privacy Statement applicable to that credit insurance product is set forth at the end of this Privacy Statement.

How We Handle Information We Collect
It is important for you to know that in order to ensure that our customers get the very best service and the highest quality products, and to develop new products, HSBC collects demographic information (like your name, address, and social security number) and credit information (like information from your application, your credit report or related to your accounts with us). In some instances, we obtain information about you directly from Union Privilege†. In addition, if you visit our website, we may collect certain information about your internet usage.
Because some of the information we gather is not publicly available, we take great care to ensure that this information is kept safe from unauthorized access, and we will not share the information in violation of any regulation or law. HSBC diligently maintains physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with applicable laws to guard your private personal information and to assist us in preventing unauthorized disclosure or access to that information.
Top of Privacy Statement
How We Protect Your Privacy Online
Our website offers you the opportunity to view your current account information and make payments online, in addition to providing general information about our company and products. You may also view our Privacy Statement when you visit our website.
To help us learn which products, services and sections of our websites interest you, and to improve your experience, we use "cookies." Cookies are small files that our web server places on your hard drive to track activity on the website during a browsing session, and across multiple sessions. We also use cookies to "remember" which online service you last logged into, so that we can preselect that service on your next visit. The cookies we set contain no personal information. Cookies can only track activity on our website, and cannot be read by any non-HSBC websites.
We may also use online profiling to help us better understand your individual financial needs. This information does not identify you personally unless you voluntarily give us personal information while online.
We also work with other third parties to learn more about activity on our website. These vendors use "web beacons," "tracking pixels," "third party cookies" and other similar technologies to gather user demographics and usage patterns, which help us improve the effectiveness of our marketing and of our website design. These vendors do not share any personally identifiable information about you.

How We Share Information within the HSBC Family of Companies
From time to time, for general business purposes or when we think it may benefit you, we share certain information with other companies within the HSBC family of companies (our "Affiliates*"), except as prohibited by applicable law. We may also provide information to Affiliates that perform operational services related to your account(s). These Affiliates all provide financial services, such as banking, consumer finance, insurance, mortgage, and brokerage services. Some examples include companies doing business under the names HSBC, HFC®, Household, or Beneficial®. We may also share certain information with non-financial service providers that become affiliated with us in the future (such as travel, auto, or shopping clubs), except as prohibited by applicable law. The information we share might come from your application, for instance your name, address, telephone number, social security number, and e-mail address. Also, the information we share could include your transactions with us or our Affiliates (such as your account balance, payment history, and parties to the transaction), your internet usage, or your credit card usage.
Top of Privacy Statement
How We Share Information with Union Privilege, Your Union and the AFL-CIO
We have an established relationship with Union Privilege and the AFL-CIO. Pursuant to this relationship, we issue credit card offers to members of AFL-CIO affiliated unions. Except for California and Vermont residents, we share certain information about you with Union Privilege, your union and the AFL-CIO so that we and they can provide you with the services and benefits of the Union Plus Credit Card Program and continue to bring you new opportunities. We obtain some information about you directly from Union Privilege. Other information we collect comes from the sources described above. The information we share with Union Privilege, your union or the AFL-CIO includes information we receive from you on your application or other forms such as your name, address, telephone number, income, real property purchased, leased or rented, marital status, dependents and e-mail address, as well as information about your transactions with us, such as the status and usage of your Account, purchase and payment history, including merchants (and/or categories thereof) from whom you have purchased, and marketing preferences. Sharing information with Union Privilege allows them to provide you with information about valuable union benefits and services that are available to you and your family that you might not otherwise hear about. For California and Vermont residents, state law restricts how we share information about you. Accordingly, we will not share information about you in this way without your permission. If we request your permission, we will notify you of the categories of information we would like to share with Union Privilege, your union and the AFL-CIO and the manner in which you can provide us with permission if you choose to do so.
Top of Privacy Statement
How We Share Information with Other Third Parties (Non-Affiliates other than Union Privilege, Your Union and the AFL-CIO)
Except for California or Vermont residents, we may share information with companies outside of the HSBC family of companies (i.e. Non-Affiliates) that are able to extend special offers that we feel might be of value to you. These companies may be financial services providers (such as mortgage bankers, insurance agents or a re-insurer) or they may be non-financial companies (such as retailers or marketing companies). These offers are typically for products and services that you might not otherwise hear about. The information that we may provide Non-Affiliates comes from the sources described above and might include your name, address, phone number, and information about your account with us. For California and Vermont residents, applicable law requires us to obtain your permission in order to share information about you with Non-Affiliates, and so we have chosen not to share your information in this way while you are a resident of California or Vermont.
We may also provide information to Non-Affiliates that perform operational services for your account such as, collection, fraud control and marketing. The sharing of information with these types of Non-Affiliates is permitted by law. This might include a financial company (such as an insurance service provider) or a non-financial company (such as a data processor or Internet service provider) with whom we have a service agreement. The information we may share also comes from the sources described above and might include your name, address, phone number, and account experience with us.
Finally, we provide information about you to Non-Affiliates as permitted by law. These may include credit reporting agencies and companies which provide services related to your account.
