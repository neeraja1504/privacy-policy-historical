Privacy policy for Universal Hub, Boston Online and Boston Blogs | Universal Hub
Last update: 7/18/18. Changes information related to Quantcast cookies - we no longer use Quantcast for audience measurement - and to what happens when you click on an Amazon link on Universal Hub.
At Universal Hub, we value your privacy. What follows is a description of how we collect information about you and what we do (or don't do) with it:
Your name and e-mail address
You do not need to register to read posts or replies on Universal Hub, or to post replies on the site. However, if you wish to post an article yourself, or if you wish to have the system keep track of messages for you - you will need to create a free account. To do so, you'll be asked for a user name and an e-mail address. Optionally, you can also add additional information that will be displayed to other users who click on your user name at the top of a posting or comment you make. Once you create an account, you can have the system send you e-mail notifications when people reply to your posts or when people post new messages in specific forums.
Universal Hub never makes your address public - although you can let other users contact you, it is done through a "proxy" system on our site - another user fills out a form, which our server then mails to you without revealing your address to the other person.
We do not sell or give out our user names and addresses to anybody. If somebody e-mails us seeking to contact you, we will forward the message to you, leaving it up to you whether to reply.
Cookies
Universal Hub, Boston Online and Boston Blogs currently use cookies in a couple of different ways:
If you post an article or comment on Universal Hub, or sign up for notification of replies in specific discussions, the software will attempt to put a cookie on your hard drive. This cookie will identify you to the system the next time you connect to it, so that it can tell you which messages are new (i.e., posted since the last time you logged in) and to display them in your preferred form. We do not do anything else with this information.
Universal Hub, Boston Online and Boston Blogs have banner advertising. Some of the advertisers may attempt to write a cookie to your hard drive when you visit their sites.
Similarly, Universal Hub, Boston Online and Boston Blogs employ tracking software from Google Analytics. These create aggregate reports on the numbers and types of site visitors, but do not track individual users.
If you do not wish to receive a cookie, you can disable them via your browser (each browser has a different way to do this) or with add-on security software. Caveat: Without cookies enabled, you will not be able to have the sites remember your preferences or new-message settings from session to session, i.e., you will have to log in each time.
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use aggregated information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.
Universal Hub is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com. If you click on an Amazon link on Universal Hub, a tracking code will be used during that visit to Amazon, allowing Universal Hub to be credited for anything you purchase.
Other information
In addition to the above, our servers collect certain standard "log" information on each visit - the time of the visit, pages seen, type of Web browser, which site, if any, you came to our sites from and your IP address. We do not attempt to create individual user profiles from this information, but do use the data in the aggregate to help determine our audience's interests, popular pages and the like.
If you have any questions about our privacy and cookie polices, please contact Adam Gaffin at adamg@universalhub.com.
