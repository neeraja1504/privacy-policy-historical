OPTING-OUT:
Established members will occasionally receive e-mails containing information regarding new offers or special promotions from UniqPaid if they have not opted out. "Opting-out" means the user does not wish to receive such e-mails from UniqPaid.com. The opt-out can be performed upon initial registration or later.

SITE AND SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENTS:
Under rare circumstances UniqPaid.com may need to contact specific or all users in order to make an important announcement about the UniqPaid site or service changes. Members are not able to un-subscribe, or "opt-out" of these announcements, because they may contain very important information regarding their accounts.
