Introduction
Uniserve is an Internet Service Provider providing a full range of Internet services primarily to British Columbia and other provinces in Canada. For Uniserve, customer and employee privacy is a high priority. We have a long-standing policy of protecting the privacy of customers in all of our business operations. Federal Government Statute dictates that private sector organizations must follow a standardized code for the protection of personal information. Businesses, consumers, academics and government under the auspices of the Canadian Standards Association developed the code – the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (“the Act”). It lists 10 principles of fair information practices, which form ground rules for the collection, use and disclosure of personal information. These principles give individuals control over how their personal information is handled in the private sector. Uniserve is a strong believer in the objectives and goals of the Code and this policy paper sets out how we will adhere to the principles set down in the Code.
We believe that an organization is responsible for the protection of personal information and the fair handling of it at all times, throughout the organization and in dealings with third parties. Care in collecting, using and disclosing personal information is essential to continued employee and consumer confidence and good will.
