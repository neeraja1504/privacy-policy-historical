Our Commitment To Privacy
Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information
practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to
find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be
requested.
The Information We Collect:
This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on client ticketing websites managed by UniversityTickets. On
some pages, you can order products, make requests, and register to receive materials. The types of personal information
collected at these pages are:
Name
Address
Email address
Phone number
Payment Information
The Way We Use Information:
We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order only to complete that order. We do not share
this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.
We use the information you provide about someone else when placing an order only to ship the product and to confirm
delivery. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.
We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive and to distribute electronic marketing materials if you opt-
in to receive such materials. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.
We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with those concerned. For
example, we may release that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and
Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify
those individuals.
Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones
described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.
Our Commitment to Data Security
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place
appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
Our Commitment to Children's Privacy:
Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information
at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under
13.
How You Can Access or Correct Your Information
You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain by logging into your user
account and clicking ‘My Account.’ We use this procedure to better safeguard your information.
You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information yourself, by accessing the ‘My Account’ portal. To
protect your privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting your access to this
portal or permitting your corrections.

Should you have other questions or concerns about these privacy policies, please call us toll-free at 888-771-1420 or send
