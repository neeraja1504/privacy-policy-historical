This Privacy Policy ('Policy') explains how information about you is collected, used and disclosed by Unittus, Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates ('Unittus,' 'we' or 'us'). This Policy applies to all of the websites (including www.Unittus.com), products, applications (including mobile applications and applications and pages) operated by Unittus and services offered by Unittus wherever this Policy is displayed (collectively, the 'Services').
Please note that we are based in the United States of America. As such, any personal information you provide us with or is collected by us as detailed below is transferred to and processed by us in the United States of America (or other countries). By registering or subscribing to the Services, you agree to this transfer and processing.

When you register or subscribe to any of our Services, we may collect a variety of information, including your name, birth date, photographs, email address, password, phone number, including mobile phone number, billing information, credit card information and other contact or demographic information you provide. We also collect other profile data such as your personal interests and background, gender, age, geographical location and physical characteristics and any content or other communications you provide or make in connection with your use of the Services. We may also obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through our Services.
Information Automatically Collected. When you access our Services, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website, such as your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, platform type, the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave our website, date and time stamp and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your account. When you access our Services using a mobile device, we may receive or collect your mobile device ID (often referred to as UDID), mobile carrier, device manufacturer and phone number. We also collect information about your usage of, and activity on, our Services. We may associate information we automatically collect with your personal information. We and service providers acting on our behalf, such as Google Analytics, use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer our Services, to gather demographic information about our user base and to deliver you a more personalized experience.
Cookies and Other Technologies. Our Services, email messages and advertisements may use 'cookies' and other technologies such as pixel tags and Web beacons. 'Cookies' are small data files stored on your hard drive by a website. Among other things, cookies help us improve our Services and your experience. We use cookies to see which areas and features are popular and to count visits to our websites. We may also use cookies and other technologies to serve advertisements to you on our Services or on sites other than our websites. Web beacons and pixel tags are electronic images that may be used on our Services or in our emails. We use Web beacons and pixel tags to deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness, prevent fraud and to tell if an email or advertisement has been opened and acted upon.
Third Party Advertisers. Any advertisers and advertising networks (which include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms) that serve ads or provide offers to our users, on our Services or on sites other than our websites, may also use their own cookies, web beacons, pixels and other tracking technologies. Such tracking technologies are governed by the privacy policies of the entities placing the ads, and are not subject to this Policy. You can visit networkadvertising.org to see a list of advertising networks that typically serve these kinds of ads and to exercise your choice for those advertising networks. We do not control these advertisers or advertising networks or any other third parties whose websites may be linked from our Services or their practices. We recommend that your review the privacy statements of all third-party websites you visit.

Sharing Personal Information With Third Parties
Our Services allow you to share information about yourself with other individuals and other companies. Consider your own privacy and personal safety when sharing your information with anyone.

to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, subpoena, legal process or other government request, (ii) enforce our Terms of Use Agreement, including the investigation of potential violations thereof, (iii) investigate and defend ourselves against any third party claims or allegations, (iv) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Unittus, its users or the public as required or permitted by law and (v) detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues;

We may also share information with others in an aggregated form that does not directly identify you.
Choices
