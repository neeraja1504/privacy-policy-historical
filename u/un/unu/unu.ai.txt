Your Rights
You have the right to access the Personal Information that we hold about you and to correct, update, amend, suppress, delete or otherwise modify any Personal Information where it is inaccurate. When updating your Personal Information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act upon your request.
By “Personal Information,” we refer to information that you individually provide to us either directly or indirectly that on its own or in combination with other information, can be used to identify you or make you identifiable. Personal Information includes for example your name, your mailing address, your telephone number, your email-address or other information that identifies you or makes you identifiable. Information that by itself cannot be used to identify you or make you identifiable does not qualify as Personal Information.

Under the General Data Protection Regulations, regarding the processing of your Personal Information, you have the following rights:
the right to request free of charge (i) information whether your Personal Information is retained and (ii) access to and/or (iii) duplicates of the Personal Information retained. However, if the request affects the rights and freedoms of others or is manifestly unfounded or excessive, we reserve the right to charge a reasonable fee (taking into account the administrative costs of providing the information or communication or taking the action requested) or to refuse to act on the request;
the right to request proper rectification, removal or restriction of your Personal Information;
where processing of your Personal Information is either based on your consent and processing is carried out by automated means, the right to receive the Personal Information concerning you in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format or to have your Personal Information transmitted directly to another company, where technically feasible (data portability);
where the processing of your Personal Information is based on your consent, the right to withdraw your consent at any time without impact to data processing activities that have taken place before such withdrawal or to any other existing legal justification of the processing activity in question;
the right not to be subject to decisions based solely on automated processing that produces legal effects concerning you; and
the right to take legal actions in relation to any breach of your rights regarding the processing of the Personal Information, as well as to lodge complaints before the competent data protection regulators.
