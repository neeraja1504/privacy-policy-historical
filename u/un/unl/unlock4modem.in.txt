About Refund
We run unlocking services and provide the unlock code of Huawei, Alcatel, etc. Before making payment, make sure that the device is asking for the unlock / SIMLock / NCK code as mentioned in the individual post. It may be locked by your network provider and the mentioned procedure may not work for you. Before making payment think twice and check out the procedure, if everything works as mentioned in the post then only pay. No (R) no refund will be provided for any mistakes.
For refund, only those people are authorized, who are regular customers or if my provided code does not work. Refund will take time, if by any means my provided codes do not work for you, then don’t fight for an immediate refund, it will take time and will be returned.
If you have paid through PayPal and want the refund, from every transaction 0.30 USD fee will be reduced. Suppose, you have paid 2.38 USD, then in the refund, you will receive only 2.08 USD. Rest are taken by PayPal and I will be not able to refund this amount.
If Indian users have paid online through payumoney, then he will get a full refund without deducting any charges, since payumoney does not take taxes in refunding the money.
If you are agreeing with above terms and conditions then only pay. If don’t agree with above conditions, then happily search another place. We don’t have time to provide you service.
