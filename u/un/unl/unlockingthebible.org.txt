• Information You Provide to Us
It’s probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us. The amount and type of information depends on the context and how we use the information. Here are some examples:
Basic Account Information:  We ask for basic information from you in order to set up your customer account. For example, those who make a donation, make purchases, or request information and resources related to Unlocking the Bible provide a name, organization name, email address, and/or phone number, and if applicable, a password.
Transaction and Billing Information:  If you buy something from us—such as through the online e-commerce platform—or if you make a donation, you will provide additional personal and payment information that is required to process the transaction and your payment, such as your name, credit card information, and contact information.

Pixel tags (also called web beacons) are small blocks of code placed on websites and emails. Unlocking the Bible uses cookies and other technologies like pixel tags to help us identify and track visitors, usage, and access preferences for our website and its content, to inform future content creation decisions, as well as track and understand email campaign effectiveness and to deliver targeted ads.
• Information We Collect from Other Sources
We may also get information, such as an email address or phone number from third-party services about individuals who are not yet our users (…but we hope will be!), which we may use, for example, for marketing and advertising purposes like emailing and phone calls.

To monitor and prevent any problems with our website and its content, protect its security, detect and prevent fraudulent transactions and other illegal activities, fight spam, and protect the rights and property of Unlocking the Bible and others, which may result in us declining a transaction or the use of various areas of the website; and
To communicate with you – for example, through an email, about offers and promotions offered by Unlocking the Bible and others we think may be of interest to you, solicit your feedback, or keep you up to date on events, products, and/or resources at Unlocking the Bible.

The use is necessary in order to fulfill our commitments to you under our Terms of Service or other agreements with you or is necessary to administer your account.

Sharing Information
• How We Share Information
We do not sell our users’ private personal information.
We share information about you in the limited circumstances spelled out below and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy:
Subsidiaries, Employees, and Independent Contractors:  We may disclose information about you to our subsidiaries, our employees, and individuals who are our independent contractors that need to know the information in order to help us provide our Services or to process the information on our behalf. We require our subsidiaries, employees, and independent contractors to follow this Privacy Policy for personal information that we share with them.
Third-Party Vendors:  We may share information about you with third-party vendors who need to know information about you in order to provide their services to us, or to provide their services to you or your site. This group includes vendors that help us provide our Services to you (like payment providers that process your credit and debit card information, fraud prevention services that allow us to analyze fraudulent payment transactions, postal and email delivery services that help us stay in touch with you, customer chat and email support services that help us communicate with you, registrars, registries, those that assist us with our marketing efforts (e.g. by providing tools for identifying a specific marketing target group or improving our marketing campaigns), those that help us understand and enhance our Services (like analytics providers), and companies that make products available on our websites. We require vendors to agree to privacy commitments in order to share information with them.
Legal Requests:  We may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request.
To Protect Rights, Property, and Others:  We may disclose information about you when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Unlocking the Bible, third parties, or the public at large. For example, if we have a good faith belief that there is an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury, we may disclose information related to the emergency without delay.
Organization Transfers:  In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, or acquisition of all or a portion of our organization by another company, or in the unlikely event that Unlocking the Bible goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would likely be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. If any of these events were to happen, this Privacy Policy would continue to apply to your information and the party receiving your information may continue to use your information, but only consistent with this Privacy Policy.
With Your Consent:  We may share and disclose information with your consent or at your direction. For example, we may share your information with third parties with which you authorize us to do so, such as the social media services that you connect to your site through our Share feature.
Aggregated or De-Identified Information:  We may share information that has been aggregated or reasonably de-identified, so that the information could not reasonably be used to identify you. For instance, we may publish aggregate statistics about the use of our Services and we may share a hashed version of your email address to facilitate customized ad campaigns on other platforms.
Published Support Requests:  And if you send us a request (for example, via a support email or one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish that request in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.
Security
While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect information about you against unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so, such as monitoring our Services for potential vulnerabilities and attacks.
Choices
You have several choices available when it comes to information about you:
Limit the Information that You Provide:  If you have an account with us, you can choose not to provide the optional account information, profile information, and transaction and billing information. Please keep in mind that if you do not provide this information, certain features of our services – for example, making a donation or purchasing through our e-commerce platform – may not be accessible.
Limit Access to Information On Your Mobile Device:  Your mobile device operating system should provide you with the ability to discontinue our ability to collect stored information or location information via our mobile website and/or mobile apps. If you do so, you may not be able to use certain features (like adding a location to a photograph, for example).
Opt-Out of Electronic Communications:  You may opt out of receiving promotional messages from us. Just follow the instructions in those messages. If you opt out of promotional messages, we may still send you other messages, like those about your account and legal notices.
Set Your Browser to Reject Cookies:  You can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies before using Unlocking the Bible’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Unlocking the Bible’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.
Close Your Account:  While we would be sorry to see you go, if you no longer want to use our services, you may request your Unlocking the Bible account to be closed. Please keep in mind that we may continue to retain your information after closing your account, for example, for legal obligations such as law enforcement requests, or reasonably needed for our legitimate business interests.
