SECURITY AND REGISTRATION POLICIES
We go to great lengths to protect your personal information. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), the industry-standard encryption technology to ensure that all of your personal and transactional information is protected to the highest standards over the Internet.
When the letters "http" in the URL change to "https," the "s" indicates you are in a secure area employing SSL. Your browser may also produce a pop-up message stating that you are about to enter or leave a secure area. Using a browser that is SSL capable will ensure that your information is encoded or encrypted when it is sent over the Internet.
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet and no data storage can be 100% secure. Consequently, while we endeavor to safeguard your personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure, we do not warrant or guarantee the absolute security of any personal information you transmit to, from or through our website.
We will notify you in the event we become aware of a security breach involving your personal information stored by or for us. By disclosing your email address to us for any reason, you
expressly consent
to receive electronic notice from us in the event of such a security breach. If you believe that your account or any information you provided to us in no longer secure, please notify us immediately by using the email address or calling the phone number given in the How to Contact Us section below .
