Definitions
“Personal Information” or “information” means information that (1) is transferred from the EU to the United States; (2) is recorded in any form; (3) is about, or pertains to a specific individual; and (4) can be linked to that individual.
“Sensitive Personal Information” means personal information that reveals race, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership or that concerns an individual’s health.
Principles
Notice
The Company shall inform an individual of the purpose for which it collects and uses the Personal Information and the types of non-agent third parties to which the Company discloses or may disclose that information. The Company shall provide the individual with the choice and means for limiting the use and disclosure of their Personal Information. Notice will be provided in clear and conspicuous language when individuals are first asked to provide Personal Information to the Company, or as soon as practicable thereafter, and in any event before the Company uses or discloses the information for a purpose other than for which it was originally collected.
Choice
The Company will offer individuals the opportunity to choose (opt out) whether their Personal Information is (1) to be disclosed to a third party or (2) to be used for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. For Sensitive Personal Information, the Company will give individuals the opportunity to affirmatively or explicitly (opt out) consent to the disclosure of the information for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. The Company shall treat Sensitive Personal Information received from an individual the same as the individual would treat and identify it as Sensitive Personal Information.
Onward transfers
Prior to disclosing Personal Information to a third party, Company shall notify the individual of such disclosure and allow the individual the choice (opt out) of such disclosure, Company shall ensure that any third party for which Personal Information may be disclosed subscribes to the Principles or is subject to law providing the same level of privacy protection as is required by the Principles and agrees in writing to provide an adequate level of privacy protection.
Data Security
The Company shall take reasonable steps to protect the Information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.  The Company has put in place appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration or destruction.  The Company cannot guarantee the security of information on or transmitted via the Internet.  As noted above, the Company has adopted a Personally Identifiable Information (PII) Security Policy to protect private information.

To the extent necessary for those purposes, the Company shall take reasonable steps to ensure that Personal Information is accurate, complete, current and reliable for its intended use.
Access
The Company shall allow an individual access to their Personal Information and allow the individual to correct, amend or delete inaccurate information, except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the privacy of the individual in the case in question or where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated.
Enforcement
