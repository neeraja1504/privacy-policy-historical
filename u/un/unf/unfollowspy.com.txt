Privacy Policy
This policy covers the following matters (amongst others): the collection of personal information; the use of that personal information; the legal bases for the processing of that information; disclosures of that personal information to third parties; international transfers of personal information; and the use of cookies on the website.
In any event, there are many aspects to data protection compliance. Publishing a privacy policy or statement containing the relevant information is only one aspect - albeit an important aspect - of compliance.
Section 1: Introduction
Section 1.1
"Personal data" is defined in Article 4(1) of the GDPR:
"(1) 'personal data' means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ('data subject'); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person".

Section 3: How we use your personal data
Article 13(1) of the GDPR provides that:
"(1) Where personal data relating to a data subject are collected from the data subject, the controller shall, at the time when personal data are obtained, provide the data subject with all of the following information: ... (c) the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended as well as the legal basis for the processing; (d) where the processing is based on point (f) of Article 6(1), the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party".
Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR provides that:
"(1) Processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that at least one of the following applies: ... (f) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child."
Section 3.1
Article 14 of the GDPR, which applies where personal information is not obtained from the data subject, provides that information about "the categories of personal data concerned" must be supplied to data subjects.
Article 13 of the GDPR, which applies where personal information is obtained from the data subject, does not include an equivalent provision.
Nonetheless, we have included references to general categories of data in this document, because this facilitates the identification of particular purposes of processing and the legal bases of processing - information which does need to be provided under Article 13.
Section 4: Providing your personal data to others
Article 13(1)(e) of the GDPR requires that where personal data are collected from the data subject, the data controller must provide the data subject with information about "the recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data".
Equivalent rules for data collected from someone other than the data subject are in Article 14(1)(e).
Section 4.1
Your personal data isnâ€™t shared with any other companies by us.
Section 5: International transfers of your personal data
Article 13(1)(f) of the GDPR requires that data controllers disclose to data subjects "where applicable, the fact that the controller intends to transfer personal data to a third country or international organisation and the existence or absence of an adequacy decision by the Commission, or in the case of transfers referred to in Article 46 [transfers subject to appropriate safeguards] or 47 [binding corporate rules], or the second subparagraph of Article 49(1) [limited transfers for compelling legitimate interests], reference to the appropriate or suitable safeguards and the means by which to obtain a copy of them or where they have been made available".
