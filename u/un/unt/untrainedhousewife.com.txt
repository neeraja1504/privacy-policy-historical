Privacy
This is a blog that is hosted on the internet which, like all internet things, means that your browser tells the ads and things on my site, information about where you live and that sort of thing. Google Analytics has a fancy schmancy way of tracking this full of technobabble below. The nerds have special way of protecting that information. Ads will be shown to you and sometimes the internet things will personalize that if you have cookies enabled.
When you sign up for a newsletter I will sometimes email you about stuff. Not all the time though, I’m usually too busy keeping my kids alive and trying the squeeze in the occasional shower so I am suitable for public consumption. All the emails are managed by ConvertKit which has a whole team of people dedicated to protecting your information.
Sometimes I will tell you about products and use links that give me a referral – that’s called Affiliate information. I will tell you about that in the posts though too.
Now here’s a bunch of extra legally words to keep all the international nerd gods happy. See that information below.
