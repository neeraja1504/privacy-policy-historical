Cookies and Web Beacons :
I do use cookies to store information, such as your personal preferences when you visit my site. This could include only showing you a popup once in your visit.
I also use third party advertisements on www.uncommondesignsonline.com to support my site.  These advertisers use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on my site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit my site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. Google’s use of the DoubleClick cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads to my users based on their visit to my site and/or other sites on the internet. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).
Ad networks that may appear on my site are Google Adsense and Mediavine.
