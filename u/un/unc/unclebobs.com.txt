Cookies and Tracking Technologies
As is true of most websites, our Site gathers certain information automatically and stores it in log files. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.
We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. We do this to improve services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or site functionality.
Technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts may be used by Life Storage and our marketing, analytics and other service providers. These technologies are used to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our Site user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these service providers on an individual as well as aggregated basis.
We may use cookies, for example, to keep track of your preferences and profile information. Cookies are also used to collect general usage and volume statistical information that does not include personal information. You can choose to not accept cookies, but you may not be able to use some features of the Site.
Some Life Storage business partners (e.g., advertisers or tracking utility companies) may use cookies on the Site. Life Storage does not have access or control over these cookies. For example, Life Storage utilizes Google Analytics, a common website analytics tool. For more information about Google Analytics, please refer to the website, "How Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps" at http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/.
Online Tracking / Do Not Track
Life Storage does not track you across third party websites and therefore we do not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals. However, some third party sites do keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you. Life Storage may subscribe to these third party services in order to provide targeted advertising. If you are visiting such sites, your internet browser may allow you to set the DNT signal on your browser so that third parties (particularly advertisers) know you do not want to be tracked.

The Site is intended for audiences at least 18 years old. Life Storage does not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. Life Storage reserves the right to delete any information we believe to be in violation of this Privacy Policy.

We implement reasonable electronic, procedural and physical security measures to protect our customer's personal information. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, therefore, we cannot guarantee the absolute safety of your data, and you transmit data to us at your own risk.
