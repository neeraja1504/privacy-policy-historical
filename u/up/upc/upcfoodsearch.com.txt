Privacy Policy - UPC Food Search
UPC Food Search is committed to ensuring that any personal information you provide to us is kept private and secure. You can visit and use UPC Food Search without giving us any personal data. We collect the e-mail addresses only for the purpose of site registrations. On occasion, we do run reports to track the amount of traffic to our web site, but this information is statistical only and can not be traced back to any one individual.
Log Files
As with most other websites, we collect and use the data contained in log files. The information in the log files include your IP (internet protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider, such as AOL or Shaw Cable), the browser you used to visit our site (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox), the time you visited our site and which pages you visited throughout our site. We collect this information to improve the content of our Web page, used to customize the content and/or layout of our page for each individual visitor, used to notify consumers about updates to our Web site and is in no way shared with other organizations for commercial purposes.
Cookies and Web Beacons
We do use cookies to store information, such as your personal preferences when you visit our site. This could include only showing you a popup once in your visit, or the ability to login to some of our features, such as adding and updating product information. UPC Food Search does not use cookies to track personal information. You can chose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security. However, this can affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as other websites. This could include the inability to login to services or programs, such as logging into accounts.
Third Party Ads
We also use third party advertisements on UPC Food Search.com to support our site. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).
UPC Food Search has many links to web sites that are not affiliated with us, and we cannot take responsibility for any content or policies of third-party web sites.
