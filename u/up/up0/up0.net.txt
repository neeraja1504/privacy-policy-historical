Client Data
Uptilt provides online marketing services and products to its clients. These services include customer database management and analysis, e-mail delivery, e-mail tracking and web site tracking. For all clients, Uptilt is contractually bound to keep customer data private and prevented from sharing data across multiple clients. For example, if one of our client's customers has two e-mail addresses, and these addresses are stored in our database, we may not share this fact with another client, even if the second client has the same customer has the first client. The example below illustrates this. Client A and Client B both share the customer John Doe. Client A has two email addresses for John Doe, but Client B does not because Client B has not gathered that information.

As with the email example above, this data is not shared across multiple clients.
Uptilt is not responsible for its clients' privacy policies and makes no representations about their accuracy. If you have questions about our clients' practices, we recommend you check their privacy policies and/or contact them directly. Security
