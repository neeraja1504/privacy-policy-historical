Log File and Cookie Information
Log Files. For all users of the Site, the Site's web server uses an extended log file format which captures: date and time of visit, referring address (location from which a visitor comes to the Site), type of Internet browser, and visitor's IP address. (Each computer that connects to the Internet is assigned a unique number, an IP address, for identification purposes). The log file does not capture a user's email address.

Once placed onto your machine, the cookie will allow the website to "recall" you as a unique individual. The Site uses cookies to personalize information for certain segments of its customer base. In some instances, cookies are also used to associate individual customers with their information profiles where users have elected to create such a profile. For example, through the use of cookies, the Site can "recall" your user ID when you login to the Site on your computer. Should you choose to do so, cookies can be removed from your hard drive and certain web browsers can be set so that cookies are not used or saved. Please check with your browser provider for more information on removing cookies.
Except where you have registered an account with us, the log files and cookies do not allow us to determine the identity of the user. However, as noted above, this information may allow us to determine things like the URL of the website you visited before coming to this website, , the type of browser or mobile device you are using to access the Site, your IP address, language, , approximate geographic location, and time zone. We, and/or our authorized third party service providers may automatically collect this information when you access and use the Site through the use of electronic tools like log files and cookies. We use non-personally identifiable information to troubleshoot, administer the Site and its services, analyze trends, gather demographic information, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities. We may also share this information with our authorized third party service providers to measure the overall effectiveness of our online tools, content, and programming.

For example, we get updated addresses from the National Change of Address (NCOA) service to assist us in having the correct addresses for our customers.
Links
The Site may contain links to third party websites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such third party sites. We do not exercise control over third party websites displayed as search results or links from within the Site and these third party websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. As such, we encourage our users to be aware of this fact when they leave our website and to read the privacy policies or statements of each and every website that they visit which collects personally-identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected on the Site.
Security
UPrinting.com has security measures in place to protect customer information. UPrinting.com takes reasonable precautions to protect against the loss, misuse and unauthorized access of your personal information under our control. Because the security of your personal information is a high priority, we have taken numerous steps to ensure that it is processed confidentially, accurately and securely. The Site uses encryption technology, such as Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology, which is supported by the vast majority of modern Internet browsers. SSL technology represents the highest level of security available on the Internet, automatically encrypting information traveling over the Internet, verifying the identity of the transacting servers through certificates and digital signatures, and confirming that the integrity of the message content is maintained throughout its transmission. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we employ commercially reasonable security measures to protect data and seek to partner with service providers which do the same, we cannot guarantee the security of any information transmitted to the Site and are not responsible for the actions of any third parties that may receive any such information.
Account Information and other password-protected areas of the Site can be accessed only with a valid user name and password. Each password owner is responsible for keeping the password confidential and safe, as we have no control or responsibility for this type of user information. If the password may have been stolen or might otherwise be misused, it is the responsibility of the subject user to notify us immediately for further action.

The Site is hosted on servers located in the United States. If you are a user accessing our websites from the European Union, Australia, Asia, or any other region with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure, that differ from United States laws, you are transferring your personal data to the United States which may not have the same data protection laws as such other regions. By providing user information through the Service, you are consenting to the transfer of your information to the United States for processing and maintenance in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the Terms & Conditions. You are also consenting to the application of United States law in all matters concerning the Site and any services offered or provided therefrom.
