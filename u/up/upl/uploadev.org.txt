This Privacy Policy applies to uploadev.org (hereinafter, “us”, “we”, or “uploadev.org”). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable information you may provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) to explain what information may be collected on our Website, how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect through the Website and does not apply to our collection of information from other sources.
This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted on our Website, set forth the general rules and policies governing your use of our Website. Depending on your activities when visiting our Website, you may be required to agree to additional terms and conditions.
Website Visitors
Like most website operators, UploadEv collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. UploadEv’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how UploadEv’s visitors use its website. From time to time, UploadEv may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
UploadEv also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on http://uploadev.org blog posts. UploadEv only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to UploadEv’s websites choose to interact with UploadEv in ways that require UploadEv to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that UploadEv gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at http://uploadev.org to provide a username and email address.
Security
The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by UploadEv and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

Uploadev.org uses Google AdWords for remarketing
Uploadev.org uses the remarketing services to advertise on third party websites (including Google) to previous visitors to our site.

Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on someone’s past visits. Of course, any data collected will be used in accordance with our own privacy policy and Google’s privacy policy.
You can set preferences for how Google advertises to you using the Google Ad Preferences page, and if you want to you can opt out of interest-based advertising entirely by cookie settings or permanently using a browser plugin.

Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, UploadEv discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when UploadEv believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of UploadEv, third parties or the public at large.
If you are a registered user of http://uploadev.org and have supplied your email address, UploadEv may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with UploadEv and our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. UploadEv takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
