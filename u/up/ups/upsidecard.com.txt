Registration
In order to use a large section of this Web Site, you must first complete an online registration form and create a user name and password. During registration you are required to give contact information such as name, address, phone number and email address. We use this information to contact you about the services on our site in which you have expressed interest.
You have the option to provide demographic information such as gender to us; we encourage you to submit this information so we can provide you a more personalized experience on our site.
Application for a Card
If you apply for an UPside Card on our site, we require that you provide certain personally identifiable information, including your name, address, phone number, date of birth, bank account information and/or credit card information and Social Security Number. This information is necessary to process your application and contact you, as well as comply with the USA Patriot Act with respect to the issuance of financial instruments.
As part of the card application process, part of the information you supply to us is transmitted to one of the 3 major US Credit Bureaus, Experian, Equifax or TransUnion solely for the purpose of verifying the consistency of your identity, Social Security Number and address. We do not seek any information pertaining to your credit record from such bureaus. We do not retain any copy of your Social Security Number after such verification.
Further storage and management of the card application information is governed by MetaBank Privacy Policy, as MetaBank is the issuer of the cards.
Participation in the Loyalty Program
Once your application for an UPside Card is successfully approved, you may opt to become a member of the UPside Loyalty Program, allowing you to be granted loyalty points exchangeable for certain rewards, and allowing you to receive special product recommendations and offers from third-party merchants or service providers having partnered with Plastyc to this effect.
During the Loyalty Program opt-in process, we may ask you non-personally identifiable lifestyle information such as preferred music genres, favorite sports, or preferred brands of products. We will use card usage information such as the frequency and amounts of monetary reloads in the card to determine how many loyalty points you may receive.
We will use certain non-personally identifiable information such as zip code, or lifestyle information provided by you during the UPside Loyalty Program opt-in process, to direct product recommendations and offers from third-party merchants to your online account.
No personally identifiable information will be passed along by Plastyc to any third-party merchant as part of the UPside Loyalty Program services. Only if you (a) choose voluntarily to accept a product recommendation or offer, and (b) decide to contact the merchant having originated the recommendation or offer, or (c) decide to redeem some of your points with certain merchant, will any personally identifiable information be possibly accessible to such merchant.
You may opt out of the Loyalty Program at any time through the UPside Card websites.
Participation in photo deposit of checks
Once your application for an UPside Card is successfully approved, you may opt to become a member of the Ingo service, allowing you to load the amount of certain paper checks issued to you into your card account. You will have to agree to the Terms and Conditions of Ingomoney, the provider of the Ingo service, prior to using this service.
During the photo depositing of a paper check, your choice of obtaining your funds in minutes or waiting a few days for the check to clear, will be recorded, as well as your decision to approve or decline the fee relative to the service.
We may share non-personally identifiable information such as the frequency and amounts of photo deposits of checks, the percentage of "funds in minutes" versus of "funds in days" that you have chosen and the percentage of instances when you have declined the fees, strictly for research purposes and only to non-commercial third parties. Such information will never be used for marketing purposes.
Participation in Surveys or Contests
From time to time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information and demographic information (e.g. zip code)
We use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes to participants to monitor site traffic, and to personalize the site to best fit the needs of our customers.
We may use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests; that company is/will be prohibited from using our users’ personally identifiable information for any other purpose. We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you prior written notice and choice.
