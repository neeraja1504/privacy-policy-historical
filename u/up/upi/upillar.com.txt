3.  Information We Collect and How We Use It
upillar.com collects certain information from and about its users four ways: directly from our Web Server logs, Web Beacons, the user, and with Cookies.
a. Web Server Logs.
When you visit our Website, we may track information to administer the site and analyze its usage. Examples of information we may track include:
Your Internet protocol address.
The kind of browser or computer you use.
Number of links you click within the site.
State or country from which you accessed the site.

b. Web Beacons.
Web pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons – sometimes also called single-pixel gifs – that allow upillar.com to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. We may include Web beacons on our web pages or emails in order to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon.
Some of these Web beacons may be placed by third party service providers to help determine the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns or email communications. These Web beacons may be used by these service providers to place a persistent cookie on your computer. This allows the service provider to recognize your computer each time you visit certain pages or emails and compile anonymous information in relation to those page views, which in turn enables us and our service providers to learn which advertisements and emails bring you to our website and how you use the site. upillar.com prohibits Web beacons from being used to collect or access your personal information.
c. Use of Cookies.
upillar.com may use cookies to personalize or enhance your user experience. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a Web Server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. For example, if you personalize a web page, or navigate within a site, a cookie helps the site to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. Hence, this simplifies the process of delivering relevant content and eases site navigation by providing and saving your preferences and login information as well as providing personalized functionality.
upillar.com reserves the right to share aggregated site statistics with partner companies, but does not allow other companies to place cookies on our website unless there is a temporary, overriding customer value.
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies. If you reject cookies by changing your browser settings then be aware that this may disable some of the functionality on our Website.
d. Personal Information Users.
To help our customers with finding the classifieds that they are searching for, certain personal information is necessary to accomplish this task. Zip Codes, city, state, and other information may be necessary to bring the buyers and sellers together or to help the visitor or customer searching for a listing to find the right one nearest to him or her. Once a listing is found that you like, you may contact the user that posted this classified via email, phone, or letter depending on what means the seller has disclosed at the time of the listing. If an email is sent or “Offer” is made, upillar.com will provide the seller the necessary contact information that is needed for him or her to contact you. This may include, but is not limited to: your email, phone number, city, state, and Zip Code. This information will be sent to seller through email. Email is not always secure and may be viewable by other parties. We cannot guarantee that the seller will keep private this information. You agree that upillar.com, its parent and subsidiary companies, and its employees and agents will not be held liable for the release of this information. You give upillar.com the right to email you with this information if an offer is made to you (the seller) and/or question is made to you (the seller) from a potential buyer. Upon accepting these terms, you give upillar.com the right to release any information necessary in any situation that is needed or necessary to bring the buyers and sellers together.
Further, you grant upillar.com the right to disclose personally identifiable information we collect from you to third parties when necessary to:
