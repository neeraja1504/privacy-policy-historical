Security
We use data hosting provider(s) in the United States to store your data. The provider(s) chosen employ industry-compliant security measures to ensure data protection and up-time. Although we are committed to employing safeguards to protect user information, due to the inherent nature of online and evolving technologies, it is not possible to completely secure any/all data.

How long is the data stored
The duration of data storage usually depends on the type of information as indicated below. After the indicated time, the data is either deleted or archived (backed up).

However, we may retain some personal information for a certain duration for us to meet certain legal and financial requirements, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements, and to support business operations.
