Information That We Collect
Steve’s keeps track of information in order to provide you with a more enjoyable, convenient shopping experience. We allow our customer to use their wish list and complete a sale without ever having to register. If you decide to register with us you will need to provide us with an e-mail address and password so that we can provide you with access to your account.

If you decide to complete your order on-line Steve’s will ask you for your name, phone number, e-mail address, billing and shipping addresses and credit card information (you always have the ability to complete your order on-line and then call in or fax in your payment information). Your information will only be shared with those that need access to such information and only the information that they need will be shared (i.e. credit card processing company, the distribution center that is shipping your order and the shipping company that will deliver your order, etc…). We may use your e-mail address and phone number to contact you regarding any questions we have regarding your order as well as to update you on the status of your order. And if you gave us permission we will use your e-mail address to notify you of special promotions and new services.

At any time, you may stop receiving e-mails by opting out from receiving such e-mails. Logging in to Steve’s doesn’t obligate you in any way or manner to stevesblinds.com.
The Scoop on Cookies
Cookies assist our customers with having a more enjoyable, convenient shopping experience. A “cookie” is a small file that is stored by your web browser on your computer’s hard drive. Cookies allow us to recognize who you are when you arrive at our site. When you arrive at our site an anonymous identification number that is stored on our secured servers is associated with your computer. We match those up with any personal information that you provided us and that is how we can recognize who you are. At no time is your personally identifiable information (name, street, address, and payment information) stored within a cookie.
Accepting cookies through your web browser is your personal choice. You can still shop from stevesblinds.com even if you set your browser to disable cookies. However, if you choose to do so, we may not be able to provide you with as exceptional a shopping experience as one that is specifically tailored to your needs.
