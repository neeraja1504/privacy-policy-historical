What This Privacy Policy Covers
This Privacy Policy explains the kinds of personal information collected by USAFIS Organization regarding individuals, and discusses how USAFIS Organization gathers, uses, processes, retains, and shares with third parties, the personal information that it collects, and other relevant matters.

By your decision to submit your personal information to USAFIS Organization through its website and/or via the application and/or using any of the methods described in this Privacy Policy, you hereby declare and obligate the following:
A. Personal information that you provide to USAFIS Organization belongs to you and is accurate, complete and correct.

USAFIS Organization will retain the personal information that you provide in the company’s data stores, and the company will be entitled to utilize that personal information and transfer it to third parties that cooperate with USAFIS Organization or act on its behalf, in adherence with the conditions this Privacy Policy sets forth.
Minors
To the extent that your consent is a basis for collecting personal information about you, there is an age requirement for you to be at least 16 years of age (or to be at least 13 years of age, if this is what has been determined by the law in your country). In the event that you do not meet the minimum age requirements, you must receive consent from your parent or guardian so that information can be processed in adherence to this Privacy Policy, and if you lack such consent, the USAFIS Organization will not provide you with its services and/or products. The USAFIS Organization reserves the right, at the discretion of the company, to request information and proof regarding your age.
The USAFIS Organization recognizes the need to provide further privacy protections with respect to personal information the company may process from children on our websites, channels and applications. Personal information for underage individuals (aged 16 and less) will be stored only after their legal guardian consents, and will be used only to deliver the application to the relevant authorities. The USAFIS Organization won’t register an individual 16 years old (or younger) as a client.
When We Collect Your Personal Information
USAFIS Organization collects personal information about you when you actively submit information to us through various means (including by email, telephone, postal delivery, online chat or social media, and/or when you provide your details in an application operated by our company), and we also gather information whenever you utilize our services, products or service channels, including through observation of your usage of our websites.
