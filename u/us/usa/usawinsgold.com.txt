McDonald's may share personal information within the McDonald's Family.  The McDonald's Family includes McDonald's Corporation, our franchisees, our subsidiaries and our affiliates. Of course, any use of this information by the McDonald's Family will comply with this policy.  Occasionally, with your permission, we will send marketing information to you, such as discount coupons, information about new product offerings, etc.  If you do not elect to receive such materials, we will not send them to you.
Companies may be engaged by McDonald's to perform a variety of functions, such as, fulfilling orders, assisting with promotions, providing technical services for our web sites, etc.  These companies may have access to personal information if needed to perform such functions.  However, these companies may only use such personal information for the purpose of performing that function and may not use it for any other purpose.
McDonald's does not sell, transfer or disclose personal information to third parties outside the McDonald's Family.  However, with your permission, we will, on occasion send marketing information on behalf of one of our business partners about products or services they provide that may be of interest to you.  You may be asked if you wish to receive marketing materials from McDonald's business partners.  If you elect to receive such materials, McDonald's will not share your personal information with such partners but rather will send a mailing or e-mail on behalf of the partners.

3. Children’s Privacy Notice
McDonald's understands the importance of privacy to visitors to our Web sites.  We are especially committed to protecting the privacy of children who visit our Web sites.  This Children’s Privacy Notice is designed to answer your questions regarding our practices with respect to personal information we collect through our Web sites from children under the age of 13.
What Personal Information Does McDonald’s Collect?
We offer many features on our Web sites, like games and coloring books, which do not require a child to provide any personal information. On occasion, however, we may collect personal information, such as an email address, from children as part of an activity.  For example:
We may collect a child’s email address to notify the child if he or she has won or lost a contest or sweepstakes.  In that event, we will notify the child using the email address the child supplies.  We will not keep the address or use it for any other purpose.
We may collect a child’s email address in order to respond to a request from the child on a one-time basis, such as to send the child a screen saver. In this case we promptly delete the email address from our system once we have responded, and we do not use the address for any other purpose.
We may offer children the opportunity to send cards, photos or links to games to their friends via our Web sites.  In those cases, we may request the child’s first name and the first name(s) and/or email address(es) of the recipient(s).  We delete such first names and email addresses after sending.  We will retain any photos for the period of time we identify on the applicable site.
We will not collect other personal information from a child under the age of 13, such as a postal address or telephone number, without the consent of a parent or guardian. If parent or guardian consent is required we will collect the email address of the parent or guardian so we can provide notice of our information practices and/or seek the parent’s or guardian’s consent.
McDonald's will not condition a child's participation in any online activity on the child's disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in that activity.
How Does McDonald’s Use the Personal Information It Collects?
We use email addresses submitted by a child in order to respond to the child’s request or to notify the child if he or she has won or lost a contest or sweepstakes they entered.  We use the email address of a parent or guardian, in order to provide the parent notice of our information practices or to seek the parent’s or guardian’s consent.
If a child provides his or her first name and a friend’s first name and/or email address to request we send a card, photo or game to the friend, then we use that information solely to send the card, photo or link to a game to the friend’s email address.
How Does McDonald’s Share Personal Information?
We may share a child’s personal information with third parties to the extent reasonably necessary to protect the security or integrity of our sites, take precautions against liability, or respond to judicial process or requests from other governmental authorities; or when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss, or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.
We also may share personal information collected from children with vendors that perform services for McDonald’s.  These services may include hosting our Web sites, providing technical services to McDonald’s, fulfilling requests or administering sweepstakes. Such vendors are obligated to protect the confidentiality of the personal information we share with them.
Requests from Parents Regarding Our Children’s Privacy Practices
Parents may review personal information we have collected from their child that has not been deleted, and can request that the personal information be deleted from our records if it has not been already.  Parents also may refuse to permit further collection or use of their child’s personal information, when the parent has previously provided consent.  To do so, please contact us at the address, telephone number or email address provided below with your request.
Who Should I Contact with Questions?
We urge parents to regularly monitor and supervise their children's on-line activities.  If you have any questions about our Children’s Privacy Notice, please contact us at:
