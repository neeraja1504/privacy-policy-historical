Privacy Policy | USA Rugby
(Last updated May 20, 2018)
To provide all USA Rugby members (including players, coaches, parents, administrators and officials) with quality service, USA Rugby must collect, process, and use its members’ personal information. At the same time, we want to protect the personal information you provide to us. To underscore USA Rugby’s commitment to protecting your privacy and the value we place on your relationship with us, USA Rugby has adopted the following privacy principles applicable to our handling of your personal information.
Section 1. Expectation of Privacy
USA Rugby recognizes and respects your expectation of privacy and security for your personal information and we are committed to safeguard the sensitive information about you within USA Rugby.
Section 2. Use, Collection, and Retention of Information
USA Rugby collects, uses, and retains information about you to help in the development and enhancement of our services; to understand which services will best meet your needs; to provide you with product and service opportunities that we deem interesting or beneficial to you; and to help administer our core business and programs.
Data is primarily collected through the process of becoming or renewing a USA Rugby membership (https://webpoint.usarugby.org), and expanded upon when invited to or participating in high performance camps, events, and matches (https://hiperforms.com). Data is also collected from the ticketing agencies of any USA based matches, and through voluntary registration forms created by USA Rugby for event information, media accreditation and service application.
Your data is used exclusively by and for USA Rugby, and is never given or sold to 3rd party organizations. We may serve you tailored and relevant ads both on and off our services, as they pertain to USA Rugby information, updates, and events. We use data about Members for communications promoting membership, engagement and events.
Requests to edit/update/remove your data should be sent to the membership department.
Section 3. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)
COPPA, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, applies to individually identifiable information about a child that is collected online, such as full name, home address, email address, telephone number or any other information that would allow someone to identify or contact the child. The Act and Rule also cover other types of information — for example, hobbies, interests and information collected through cookies or other types of tracking mechanisms — when they are tied to individually identifiable information.
At this time, USA Rugby requires parental consent for children under the age of 13 to register or provide other information to USA Rugby through the use of the internet website, www.usarugby.org. If, at any time, USA Rugby policy changes to allow for the collection of information from children under the age of 13, the changes will be notified in this document, and additional information will be provided pursuant to COPPA, in the form of: (a) names and contact information of operators employed by USA Rugby to collect this data; (b) types of information and reasons for USA Rugby to obtain this information from children; (c) procedures by which parents can review a child’s personal information.
CHILDREN 13 & UNDER
