Website Visitors
Like most website operators, The Chess Club and Scholastic Center of Saint Louis (CCSCSL) collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. CCSCSL’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how CCSCSL’s visitors use its website. From time to time, CCSCSL may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
CCSCSL also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. CCSCSL does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to CCSCSL’s websites choose to interact with CCSCSL in ways that require CCSCSL to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that CCSCSL gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a site membership to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with CCSCSL – by purchasing merchandise, memberships, or tournament registrations, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, CCSCSL collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with CCSCSL. CCSCSL does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
Aggregated Statistics
CCSCSL may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. CCSCSL may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, CCSCSL does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
CCSCSL discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on CCSCSL’s behalf or to provide services available at CCSCSL’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using CCSCSL’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. CCSCSL will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, CCSCSL discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when CCSCSL believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of CCSCSL, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an CCSCSL website and have supplied your email address, CCSCSL may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on at the CCSCSL. We primarily use our website to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. CCSCSL takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
