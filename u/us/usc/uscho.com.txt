Our commitment to privacy
Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy, we’ve put together this policy so you’ll know what we will and won’t do with information we collect from visitors to USCHO.com, and what we do to protect it.
Information you provide
USCHO.com does not require visitors to provide any personal information to visit any area of this site. However, visitors who wish to post messages on the USCHO.com Fan Forum, the bulletin board portion of our site, must register to do so.
When visitors to USCHO.com register for the USCHO.com Fan Forum, they are required to choose a user name and password, and to provide their e-mail address, which is used to confirm that registration is successful. Any other information users choose to provide is optional.
When signing up for the USCHO.com Fan Forum, registrants can indicate that they do not wish to receive e-mail from USCHO.com or its sponsors.
As a registered member of the USCHO.com Fan Forum, you may receive e-mail from the board administrator. We’ll send messages on occasion to let you know about important changes or new features added to the Fan Forum, or to verify that the e-mail address you provided is still working properly.
And while we at USCHO.com don’t wish to be an intrusion, we may from time to time send e-mail to registered Fan Forum members which may offer products or services that we believe will be of interest to our readers. These messages help provide the financial support needed to keep USCHO.com a free and viable service.
Information we collect automatically
The USCHO.com web server logs every visit made. This information includes the IP address of the visitor, what pages the visitor requests, and what page referred the visitor to the requested page.
We use this information only in an aggregate manner; that is, we look at the data as a whole to see what areas of USCHO.com are most popular, to detect problems with the web server, and to determine how well our site handles the load placed on it by visitors to the site.
We do not use this information to track individual visitors, and we do not share the specific data in our server logs with any third party. However, we may find it necessary to trace IP addresses if we receive reports of abuse or find evidence of attempts to violate site security.
No other information about visitors is collected.
USCHO.com may use the overall data to provide information about our site’s traffic to current and potential advertisers.
