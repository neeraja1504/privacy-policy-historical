Privacy Policy
Submitting information is strictly voluntary. By doing so, you are giving USIP your permission to use the information for the intended purpose. If you do not want to give USIP permission to use your information, simply do not provide it. However, not providing certain information may result in USIP's inability to provide you with the information or services you desire.
We never collect information for commercial marketing purposes.
Information collected and stored automatically
We collect and temporarily store certain technical information about your visit for use in site management and security purposes. This information includes:
The Internet domain from which you access our website (for example, "xcompany.com" if you use a private Internet access account, or "yourschool.edu" if you connect from an educational institution);

This information is only used to help us make our site more useful for you. With this data we learn about the number of visitors to different sections of our site, find out what information is the most viewed, the types of technology our visitors use, and to help us make our website more useful to visitors.
Personal information volunteered by visitors
If you choose to provide us with personal information by sending us an e-mail, or by filling out a form with your personal information and submitting it through our website to register for an event, obtain a publication, or join a mailing list, we use that information only to fulfill your request or respond to your inquiry.
We do not collect personal information about our visitors unless you choose to provide this information.

Information from children
In general, this website is not intended for use by persons under 13 years of age unless they have a parent or guardians' permission. We do not knowingly solicit or collect personal information from or about children, other than that detailed in the previous sections that is automatically collected on every visitor unless you choose to provide information to us. We provide many on-line tools and services in support of our mission. A child under 13 years old may inadvertently provide personal information to one of these services. If this should happen, the information about the child will be deleted immediately upon discovery.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file that a website transfers to your computer to allow it to remember specific information about your session while you are connected.

At no time is your private information, whether stored in cookies or elsewhere, shared with third parties who have no right to that information.
