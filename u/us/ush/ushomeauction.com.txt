3. Collection of Your Information
Personal Information. We do not collect personal information (such as names, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, or financial account information) from you when you browse the Services, unless you have specifically and knowingly provided us with personal information, e.g., by creating an account through the Services (“Ten-X Account”), updating your Ten-X Account profile, registering for or participating in a marketing or transaction event, registering to participate in the community features of the Services (“Community”), creating and updating your Community profile, submitting an employment application, completing online forms, or entering into a transaction with us. This information may include, without limitation, information such as your first and last name, e-mail address, telephone number, username, password, billing information, and other information exchanged in connection with real estate transactions. We also may acquire personal information from other sources such as offline records, publicly available information, or from third parties. We use this information to provide the Services and as discussed in this Privacy Statement.
Automatically-Collected Information. We may automatically collect information about the computer or devices (including mobile devices) you use to access the Services, and your interactions with the Services. For example, we may collect and store information such as your browser type, IP address, language, operating system, location of your wireless device (e.g., latitude and longitude), the state or country from which you accessed the Services, unique device identifier (e.g., a UDID or IDFA on Apple devices like the iPhone, iPad and iTouch), the pages you view, length of time spent on pages, communications with other users through the Services, the Services you use and the manner in which you use such Services (e.g., the content you access, view, click on, search for, post, favorite, vote, follow, share, upload, or tag), the date and time of your visit, the websites you visited immediately before and after visiting our Company websites, error logs, and other hardware and software information, as well as other geographic and demographic information. We may use third party analytics providers and technologies, including cookies and similar tools, to assist in collecting this information. We may use this information to formulate statistical models about use of the Services, enhance the Services for our users, and provide you with information about new opportunities, and tailored content, advertising, marketing and as otherwise discussed in this Privacy Statement. To the extent that such information is maintained in a manner that identifies your name or contact information, it will be treated as personal information; otherwise, such information will be treated as non-personal information.
Ten-X Account. If you are logged into your Ten-X Account, certain information specified in the preceding paragraph (such as what content you access, view, click on or search for on the Services, the devices from which you access such content and the length of time for which you view same), may be maintained in a manner that identifies such information with your name or contact information. Ten-X may use the account details from your Ten-X Account across all the Services that Ten-X offers. Accordingly, if you have created a Ten-X Account for one Company website or aspect of the Services, you may be able to use the same username and password for accounts on other Company websites or with respect to other aspects of the Services, without creating accounts for each such Company website or aspect of the Services. All information collected while you are logged-in to any Ten-X Account that is maintained in a manner that identifies such information with your name or contact information, may be aggregated by the Company and used as permitted by this Privacy Statement.
How to Disable the Collection of Location Information. If you are using an Apple device, click on “General,” then “Reset,” then “Reset Location and Privacy.” This will turn off location functionality for all of your apps so that the next time you download or use an app, you will be asked again to provide your consent for us and others to access your location information.
If you are using an Android device, visit the device settings, click “Location,” and then click the boxes for the particular applications for which you would like to disable location services.
Our Use of Cookies. The Services use “cookie” technology and similar online tools, such as web beacons and web pixels. “Cookies” are small files that a website stores on a user’s computer or device. The Services use cookies to keep the information you enter on multiple pages together. A majority of cookies we use are “session” cookies, meaning that they are automatically deleted from your hard drive after you close your browser at the end of your session. Session cookies are used to optimize performance of the Services and to limit the amount of redundant data that is downloaded during a single session. We also use “persistent” cookies, which remain on your computer or device unless deleted by you (or by your browser settings). We use persistent cookies for statistical analysis of performance to ensure the ongoing quality of our services. In either case, we do not use cookies to obtain or retain any personal information about you apart from what you voluntarily provide us. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you may set your browser to block cookies (consult the instructions for your particular browser on how to do this). Please note that if you decide to block cookies, this may interfere with your ability to perform certain transactions, use certain functionality, and access certain content on the Services.
Google Analytics. The Company websites may use Google Analytics, a vendor’s service that uses cookies, web beacons, web pixels and/or similar technology to collect and store anonymous information about you, which may include non-personal information described above. You can read Google Analytics’ privacy policy at http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html and Google Analytics Terms of Use at http://www.google.com/analytics/tos.html. You can opt-out from being tracked by Google Analytics in the future by downloading and installing Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on for your current web browser at http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en.

User-Initiated Communication. From time to time, portions of the Services, including, without limitation, Services available through the Community, may enable you to send emails and other types of messages to us or to third parties and to participate in bulletin boards and discussion groups. We have the right to use reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, copy, and display all such emails, messages, postings to bulletin boards and discussion groups throughout the world in any form, pursuant to Section 6 of the Terms of Use. Among other things, this right allows us to review your messages with other users to enforce our Terms of Use. Whenever you choose to initiate these kinds of communication with us, or anyone else, you may be contacted in return. Such communications may be identified by your actual name and/or your username, and may be linked to your Community profile. Also, remember that our bulletin boards and discussion groups are open to the public, and, therefore, your postings can be seen by anyone, may be indexable by search engines, and are not protected by us or any other entity. Please use your discretion when deciding whether and what to post and whom to contact and message. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to monitor, edit or delete postings from our bulletin boards and discussion groups. This reservation of rights shall not under any circumstances obligate us to conduct such edits or deletions, nor shall it cause us to be liable for any such edits or deletions.

To the extent any of this information is collected by third parties, you acknowledge and agree that such collection and use is governed by those third parties’ privacy policies and we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such third parties.
