The ordering information you provide - including credit card information - is secured using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology via Yahoo! servers. Yahoo! uses SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption when transmitting certain kinds of information, such as financial services information or payment information.

Any time a Yahoo! asks for a credit card number during checkout for payment, it will be SSL encrypted. The information you provide will be stored securely on Yahoo!’s servers. This SSL technology is used to prevent such information from being intercepted and read as it is transmitted over the Internet. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is, 100% secure, however.  Therefore we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
