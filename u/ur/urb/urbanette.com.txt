Privacy Policy & Contest Terms - URBANETTE: Lifestyle Magazine & Blog
In summary: A) We keep your information safe, and B) you can enter contests if you live in the USA.
Privacy Policy
What information do we gather about you?
The information we gather falls into two categories:
personal information you voluntarily supply when you subscribe, order, complete a survey, or provide your email address and
tracking information collected as you navigate through our site.
Paid Products
While our website is free, we do sell products such as subscriptions and back issues. To enable the purchase of these and other products, we do not store your billing  information. Billing information stays on the payment processor: Amazon.com or Google.com, and only your name, email and address is shared with us.
Reader Surveys, Reader Panels and Market Research
Urbanette Magazine may collect personal information from readers in connection with voluntary surveys. Data may be collected on our website, on the phone or via email. Readers are primarily contacted via email, which link to online surveys, but may occasionally be contacted by mail. All survey data is reported and/or used in aggregate form only, and no personally identifiable information is released.
Aggregate Information Collected Through Technology
Cookies and Other Technologies
As is standard practice on many websites, Urbanette Magazine uses “cookies” and other technologies to recognize you to help us understand which parts of our website are the most popular, where our visitors are going and how much time they spend there. We use Google Analytics to do some of this collection. We reserve the right to change the vendors who provide us with usage data.
IP Addresses
We use the IP address log in an aggregate fashion to track access to our site. Log data is  used in aggregate to analyze usage of our website.
What do we do with the information we gather about you?
Statistical Analysis
Urbanette Magazine may perform statistical, demographic and marketing analyses of subscribers, and their subscribing and purchasing patterns, for marketing and customer service purposes

If you prefer that we do not share this information, you may opt-out, by emailing customer service.
Service Providers
We contract with other companies to provide services on our behalf, including credit-card and billing processing, shipping, and website analytics. We provide these companies only with the information they need to perform their services. These service providers are restricted from using this data in any way other than to provide services for Urbanette Magazine, and they may not share or resell this data.
