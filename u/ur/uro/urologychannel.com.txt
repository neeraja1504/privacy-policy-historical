2.       NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED AND HOW COLLECTED.
When you access or visit any of our Sites, we and our operational service providers (as defined
in the “Disclosure to Third Parties” section below) and others who host our Sites often use
“cookies” and other technologies that may recognize, collect and/or transmit information that is
associated with you or your device. These various technologies may recognize, collect and/or
transmit information about your visits to our Sites, such as your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address,
the Internet or web domain that referred you, the type of operating system and browser you are
using, the date and time of your visit, data relating to activities on our Sites (e.g., so-called
“clickstream” data) and other technological attributes about your visit to the Sites. We may use
this information to analyze trends, administer the Sites, provide promotional material of interest
to users, track user movements on the Sites and gather aggregate demographic information about
visitors so we can continually improve our Sites.
Cookies and other technologies may also allow our Sites to recognize your computer or device
each time it is used to visit a particular Site, track how you use our Sites, track your preferences
for features and functions and, for our Sites that have registration or similar features, they can
store information such as your user name and password so you don’t have to re-enter them each
time you return to visit.
Third Parties that deliver advertising on our Sites may use cookies and other technologies to
collect user information when users respond to or interact with banner placements. The
information collected does not usually identify you personally, with the potential exception
described in Section 9 regarding The Body PRO.
Most Internet browsers allow you to delete or disable cookies by changing the settings on your
Internet browser. However, please note, deleting or disabling cookies may affect your ability to
use certain features and functions of our Sites and it may also require you to re-enter certain
information each time you visit or attempt to use our Sites. You should consult the operating

be personally identified. Personal Information may include such things as your name, mobile
phone number, street address, telephone number, date of birth, e-mail address, photographs of

operational service providers) or provide it on one or more of our Sites in order to allow you to
register, subscribe or take advantage of certain features, functions, services, activities,
promotions (e.g., sweepstakes and contests), and content on our Sites (these are referred to as

Information that you post within the community-based features, such as the “Share Your Story”
or “Ask a Question” features on the Health Central Site and the “Connect” and “Ask the
Experts” features on The Body Site. Please note that you may not be able to use some Content if
you choose not to provide your Personal Information when requested. If you provide or submit
your Personal Information to any of our Sites, our policy is to give you the right to review,
update and/or delete your Personal Information, subject to our obligations to comply with legal,
regulatory or internal audit and record-keeping requirements.

information. We take reasonable efforts to ensure that our operational service providers protect
your privacy, and that they are not permitted to use your Personal Information for their own

web browser “do not track” signals or other similar mechanisms that provide consumers the
