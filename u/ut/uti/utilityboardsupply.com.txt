Security Policy
Utility Board Supply.com is a completely secure web site featuring highly advanced technology to ensure that your information remains secure. We protect your online order and personal information by using high 128 bit Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology provided by the top name in Internet security: Thawte. All the data that travels between your computer and our servers is SSL encrypted. To make sure you are accessing a secure server, look at the lower left or right hand corner of your browser window after accessing the server. If you see an unbroken key or closed lock (depending on your browser), then SSL is active. Some versions of browsers and firewalls do not permit communication through secure servers. In that case, you will be unable to connect to the server so you won't have to worry about mistakenly placing an order through an unsecured connection.
