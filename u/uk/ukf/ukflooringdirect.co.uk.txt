We store your personal details on a secure server.  We use industry standard security and firewalls on our servers.  When we collect payment card details electronically, we use encryption by using “HSBC Secure” epayments section.  Whilst we are unable to guarantee 100% security, this makes it hard for a hacker to decrypt your details.

You are responsible for protecting against unauthorised access to your password and to your computer.

Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.
