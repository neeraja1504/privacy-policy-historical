We are committed to protecting the privacy of your information in accordance with the principles set out in the Data Protection Act (DPA) and the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR). This privacy policy explains how we use the personal information we collect about you when you use our websites or get in contact with us.

Your name, email address, address and/or postal code, payment method and telephone number. We collect this information in a number of ways, including when you enter it while using our service, interact with our Customer Services, or participate in surveys or marketing promotions;
Information when you choose to provide account settings, set preferences in your account, or otherwise provide information to us through our service or elsewhere;

Information collected via the use of cookies and other technologies, including ad data (such as information on the availability and delivery of ads, the site URL, as well as the date and time). See our Cookies section for more details.
We do not collect any personal data from you that we do not need in order to provide, oversee and improve this service to you.
Why we collect it
We use information to provide, facilitate, analyse, administer, enhance and personalize our service delivery and support delivery efforts in accordance with our contractual obligations to you. For example, we use information to:
Process your registration, your orders and your payments, and to communicate with you on these and other topics;
Provide secure access to our services, manage your account and support quality monitoring;
Determine your general geographic location to provide localized content, provide you with information we think will be relevant to your business, and help us quickly and efficiently respond to enquiries and requests;
Prevent, detect and investigate potentially prohibited or illegal activities, including fraud, and enforcing our terms;
Analyse and understand our customers, improve our service (including user interface experiences) and optimize content selection, search and relevance algorithms, and delivery;
Communicate with you concerning our service, so that we can send you news, details about new features or content available on our services, and customer surveys;
Measure the success of our marketing campaigns and to better understand our customers;
Assist you with operational requests such as password reset requests and other matters relating to your use of the service.
How and where we process it
The personal data that we collect from you and process in relation to our services is processed by our staff in the UK. For the purposes of IT hosting and maintenance, this information is located on servers within the European Union.
We do not undertake any automated decision making on the basis of your personal information.
What we do to protect it
We take the security of your information very seriously. To oversee the effective and secure processing of your personal information and to safeguard against its loss, theft, and unauthorized access, use and modification, we operate comprehensive data protection and information security policies and procedures, which are certified to the international standards ISO 9001 and ISO 27001, and we use reasonable administrative, logical and managerial measures.
We use multiple layers of firewalls, specialist devices to detect and prevent intrusion attempts, and encryption systems to ensure data is scrambled while being transmitted from system to system. We employ strong physical security policies to prevent physical access to our data centres. We perform regular system patching and use independent security specialists to perform penetration tests to reveal vulnerabilities in our systems and to enable them to be fixed proactively.
Unfortunately, however, no measures can be guaranteed to provide 100% security. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the security of your information.
Who it may be shared with
We disclose your information for certain purposes and to third parties, as described below:
Community Members : Your contact details, business name and job title may be shared with the UK Construction Online community members.
Service Providers : We use other service providers (i.e. companies, agents or contractors) to perform services on our behalf or to assist us with the provision of services to you. For example, we engage service providers to provide infrastructure and IT services, to provide software to enable us administer our business, to process credit card transactions or other payment methods, to collect debts, to analyse and enhance data (including data about users’ interactions with our service), and to process and administer consumer surveys. In the course of providing such services, these service providers may have access to your personal information. We do not authorise them to use or disclose your personal information except in connection with providing their services to us.
Protection of BiP and others : BiP and its Service Providers may disclose and otherwise use your personal and other information where we or they reasonably believe such disclosure is needed to:
Satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request;
Enforce applicable terms of use, including investigation of potential violations thereof;
Detect, prevent, or otherwise address illegal or suspected illegal activities (including payment fraud), security or technical issues;
Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of BiP, its customers or the public, as required or permitted by law.
Business transfers : In connection with any reorganization, restructuring, merger or sale, or other transfer of assets, we will transfer information, including personal information, provided that the receiving party agrees to respect your personal information in a manner that is consistent with our privacy policy.
You may also choose to disclose your information in the following ways:
While using our services you may have opportunities to post certain information publicly and third parties could use the information you disclose;
Certain portions of our services may contain tools that give you options to share information by email and social or other sharing applications, using the clients and applications on your smart device and the recipients could use the information you disclose;
Social plugins for browsers (including those offered by Facebook, Twitter and Google) allow you to share information on those platforms. Social plugins and social applications are operated by the social network themselves, and are subject to their own terms of use and privacy policies.
The only other times we will pass your details to anyone else would be if we are required to do so for fraud or other legal purposes.
How long we keep it
We are required under UK tax law to keep our customers’ basic personal data (name, address, contact details) for a minimum of 6 years plus the current year after which time it will be destroyed. Your information that we use for marketing purposes will be kept with us until you notify us that you no longer wish us to retain this information.
Your rights
You can request access to your personal information or correct or update inaccurate or out-of-date personal information we hold about you.
You can do this by visiting your account settings pages of the service, where you can access and update a range of information about your account. You must be signed in to access this feature. You may also request that we delete personal information we hold about you. Alternatively, you can contact us directly.
If you have given consent for your information to be used for certain purposes, such as informing you of related services and offers that may be of interest to you, you may withdraw that consent at any time.
To make requests, or if you have any other question regarding our privacy practices, please contact us at bip@bipsolutions.com.
We may reject requests that are unreasonable or not required by law, including those that would be extremely impractical, could require disproportionate technical effort, or could expose us to operational risks such as fraud. We may retain information as required or permitted by applicable laws and regulations, including to honour your choices, for our billing or records purposes and to fulfil the purposes described in this privacy policy.
If you wish to raise a complaint on how we have handled your personal data, you can contact us and we will investigate the matter.
If you are not satisfied with our response or believe we are processing your personal data in a manner that is not in accordance with the law, you can complain to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO).
