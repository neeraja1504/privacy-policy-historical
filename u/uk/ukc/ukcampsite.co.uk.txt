Cookie Policy
Like most websites, this one uses cookies.
Cookies are small text files stored on your computer by your browser. They’re used for many things, such as remembering whether you’ve visited the site before, so that you remain logged in - or to help us work out how many new website visitors we get each month. They contain information about the use of your computer but don’t include personal information about you. You can think of cookies as providing a "memory" for the website, enabling it to recognise a user and respond appropriately. Each web domain can only access cookies stored by that specific web domain, meaning that only the ukcampsite.co.uk servers can access the cookies set by the ukcampsite.co.uk domain.
By accessing the Website, you agree that this Cookie Policy will apply whenever you access the Website on any device.
Our use of cookies
We do not recommend turning cookies off when visiting ukcampsite.co.uk, as this will prevent you from registering, signing in, and using many of the services on the site. Basically the site won't work properly! If you are primarily concerned about third party cookies generated by advertisers, you can turn these off by going to the third party's websites above and getting them to generate a one-time "no thanks" cookie, which will stop any further cookies being served to your machine.
A visit to a page on ukcampsite.co.uk may generate the following types of cookie:
Google analytics cookies:
These monitor how visitors move around the Website and how they reached it. This is used so that we can see total (not individual) figures on which types of content users enjoy most, for instance. These cookies can tell us whether or not you've visited the site before. This allows us to track how many individual unique users we have, and how often they visit the site. These cookies cannot be used to identify individuals; they are used for statistical purposes only. You can opt out of these if you want: Google: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout
Registration and Functionality cookies
When you register with ukcampsite.co.uk, we generate cookies that represent whether you are signed in or not. Our servers use these cookies to work which account you are signed in with, and if you are allowed access to a particular service. Some cookies are set to remember your preferences, eg the background colour, the last time you viewed the forums so that you can see the latest posts, whether you want maps to be shown by default etc.
Third party advertising cookies
ukcampsite.co.uk serve elements of pages from multiple sources, and so after visiting you may see other cookies from third parties. Some of these third parties use their own anonymous cookies to track how many people have seen a particular ad, or to track how many people have seen it more than once. The companies that generate these cookies have their own privacy policies, and ukcampsite.co.uk has no access to read or write these cookies.

Advertising cookies
Sometimes we need to know whether or not you've seen an advert or a type of advert, and how long it is since you've seen it. In order to do this, we place a cookie on your machine when we show you some types of advertising. These cookies are anonymous, they simply count page views.
