Privacy | United Kennel Club (UKC)
Protecting your personal information is important to United Kennell Club (UKC), 100 E. Kilgore Road, Kalamazoo, MI 49002, USA ("United Kennel Club","UKC" or "we", "us", "our"). Please note that UKC is located outside of the European Union, in the United States, and thus in addition to the General Data Protection Regulation (whenever applicable), U.S. law may apply to certain aspects of having your data collected and processed.
At UKC we take your privacy seriously and understand your concerns regarding the right to control your personal information submitted through the UKC website. This privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") will explain what type of information we may collect from you or that you may provide when you visit the website URL(s) at www.ukcdogs.com ("website"), our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, disclosing that information, how users can access information that they submit through the website, and whom information may be shared with.

The Type of Information We Collect
Information You Provide to Us
Based on the consent granted (provided that no other circumstance when processing Personal Information without consent legally applies), we collect information that you have provided to contact you or to identify you personally, such as your name, company name, email address, postal address, phone number, or any other information that identifies you ("Personal Information"). We also collect aggregate information (such as how users access the website). As is true with most websites, we gather web server log file information automatically, such as your browser type, IP address, referring/exit page, and operating system.

Provided that you grant consent, you may also submit your resume via email. This information will be reviewed by our Human Resource department for recruitment purposes only. If positions are not available at the time of submission, UKC will store your resume for at least one year so that we may review it for future opportunities. Your Personal Information gathered for the purpose of recruitment will not be shared or transferred to any other third party.
UKC will never knowingly collect information from children. For consent to be valid, it must be granted by an individual of 16-years old or older. By consenting to this policy, you declare you are 16 years or older. If, despite the language of the consent, it is found that information is collected from a child below the age of 16, that user would be notified that his or her Personal Information cannot be accepted, and that Personal Information would be removed from our records immediately.
