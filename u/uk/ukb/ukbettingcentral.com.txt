Our registered office is at Stonecroft, Burley Lane, Menston,LS29 6EH
This is a notice to tell you our policy about all information that we record about you. It covers both information that could identify you and information that could not.
We are extremely concerned to protect your privacy and confidentiality.  We understand that all users of our web site are quite rightly concerned to know that their data will not be used for any purpose unintended by them, and will not accidentally fall into the hands of a third party. Our policy is both specific and strict. It complies with UK law [and with the laws of all jurisdictions of which we are aware]. If you think our policy falls short of your expectations or that we are failing to abide by our policy, do please tell us.
We regret that if there are one or more points below with which you are not happy, your only recourse is to leave our web site immediately.
Except as set out below, we do not share, or sell, or disclose to a third party, any personally identifiable information collected at this site.
"We use your personal information to provide the services you've requested (i.e. process your order). We may also use this information for auditing, research and analysis to operate and improve our technologies and services. We will not pass your details on to any third parties."
Here is a list of the information we collect from you, either through our web site or because you give it to us in some other way, and why it is necessary to collect it:
Basic identification and contact information , such as your name and contact details. ****
This information is used:
to provide you with the services which you request;
for verifying your identity for security purposes;
for marketing our services and products;
Information which does not identify any individual may be used in a general way by us or third parties, to provide class information, for example relating to demographics or usage of a particular page or service.
Market place information
When we obtain information from you specifically to enable you to buy a service offered on our web site by some other person, we assume that in giving us your information, you are also giving us permission to pass it to the relevant person.
Your domain name and e-mail address are recognised by our servers and the pages that you visit are recorded. We shall not under any circumstances divulge your e-mail address to any person who is not an employee or contractor of ours and who does not need to know, either generally or specifically. This information is used: ****
to correspond with you or deal with you as you expect.
in a collective way not referable to any particular individual, for the purpose of quality control and improvement of our site;
to send you news about the services to which you have signed up;
to tell you about other of our services or services of sister web sites.
Information you post on our website
Information you send to us by posting to a forum or blog or in your advertisement is stored on our servers. We do not specifically use that information except to allow it to be read, but you will see in our terms and conditions that we reserve a right to use it in any way we decide.
Website usage information
We may use software embedded in our website (such as JavaScript) to collect  information about which pages you view and how you reach them, what you do when you visit a page, the length of time you remain on the page, and how we perform in providing content to you. [We do not presently associate such information with an identifiable person]
Third party advertising
Third parties may advertise on our web site. In doing so, those parties, their agents or other companies working for them may use technology that automatically collects your IP address when they send an advertisement that appears on our site to your browser. They may also use other technology such as cookies or JavaScript to personalise the content of, and to measure the performance of their adverts. We do not have control over these technologies or the data that these parties obtain. Accordingly, this privacy notice does not cover the information practices of these third parties
Cookies
Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer's hard drive through your web browser when you visit any web site. They are widely used to make web sites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the site.
Like all other users of cookies, we may request the return of information from your computer when your browser requests a web page from our server. Cookies enable our web server to identify you to us, and to track your actions and the pages you visit while you use our website. The cookies we use may last for a single visit to our site (they are deleted from your computer when you close your browser), or may remain on your computer until you delete them or until a defined period of time has passed.
Complaining
When we receive a complaint, we record all the information you have given to us.  We use that information to resolve your complaint.  If your complaint reasonably requires us to contact some other person, we may decide to give to that other person some of the information contained in your complaint. We do this as infrequently as possible, but it is a matter for our sole discretion as to whether we do give information, and, if we do, what that information is.
We may also compile statistics showing information obtained from this source to assess the level of service we provide, but not in a way that could identify you or any other person.
Third party content
Our web site is a publishing medium in that anyone may register and then publish information about himself or some other person. We do not moderate or control what is posted.  If you complain about any of the content on our web site, we shall investigate your complaint. If we feel it may be justified, we shall remove it while we investigate. Free speech is a fundamental right, so we have to make a judgement as to whose right will be obstructed: yours, or that of the person who posted the content which offends you. If we think your complaint is vexatious or without any basis, we shall not correspond with you about it.
Affiliate information
This is information given to us by you in your capacity as an affiliate of us or a customer or client of ours. Such information is retained for business use only.  We undertake to preserve the confidentiality of the information and of the terms of our relationship.  It is not used for any other purpose.  We expect any affiliate to agree to reciprocate this policy. As an exception to this , we have the right to disclose your first name and URL of your affiliate connection to other affiliates and to any other person or organisation, on and off site. The reason is solely to enable us to mention winners and others whose performance as an affiliate is in some way outstanding.
Use of site by children
We do not market to children, nor do we sell products or services for purchase by children. We do sell products and services for end use by children, but for purchase by adults. If you are under 18 leave this site now.
Disclosure to Government and their agencies. We are subject to the law like everyone else. We may be required to give information to legal authorities if they so request or if they have the proper authorisation such as a search warrant or court order.  ****
Compliance with the law
This confidentiality policy has been compiled so as to comply with the law of every jurisdiction in which we aim to do business. If you think it fails to satisfy the law of your country, we should like to hear from you, but ultimately it is your choice as to whether you wish to use our website.
If you have any question regarding the confidentiality policy, please contact us through the contact page.
Now take me back where I was before reading this.
Drafting notes
Website privacy notice
General notes:
This privacy notice is usually referred to as a “privacy policy”.  The word “notice” has been introduced by the Information Commissioner’s office and that is why we now use it.
A combination of telephone hacking and other privacy scandals and the publication of the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) (Amendment) Regulations 2011 has completely changed the scenery in the area of privacy law and the expectations of those with whom we deal.  At the end of these notes we provide the full text of the ICO guide on privacy notices.  The code is to tell you what you should and should not be saying in your privacy notice. We find it muddled and unhelpful.  The fact is that we all have to comply with the new law but disclosing every cookie by name is simply impractical.
We have therefor drawn this very comprehensive document for your use.  The law is new.  The ICO clearly do not know how its requirements will unfold, and neither do we. The best we can do is to comply with the law, while recognising that someone, somewhere may find it inadequate.
The document we have provided does not magically absolve you from risk of data mismanagement, but it is a giant first step.  A good privacy notice is prime evidence to everyone you deal with and to the IBO, that you take confidentiality seriously.
We have provided a menu of possibilities, use of which depends on the structure of your business and your website. Your privacy policy is a matter for your discretion.  We have not tried to use magic words to protect you from spamming and selling data abroad. This model policy is built around:
reminding you how to avoid contravening the UK Data Protection Act and the new EU regulations;
providing re-assurance to your customers or clients;
maintaining a professional but friendly image.
Paragraph specific notes:
**           Basic identification and contact information**
This is information collected by most web sites.  What you do with it is obvious but including it here completes the picture.
**           Market place information**
To use if you take orders on your web site for a third party.
**           Your domain name and e-mail address**
This is information collected by most web sites.  Basic and obvious.
**           Information you post on our website**
This is an area often omitted from suggested text, but it may be important.  The fact that someone posts insensitive or forbidden or stupid information does not give you a licence to use it without care.  However, well drawn terms and conditions will make clear that contractually you have a licence to use any such information as you decide.
**           Website usage information**
This information is unlikely to be personally identifiable.
**           Financial information relating only to your credit cards**
In this and the following paragraphs we have given you several alternatives.  Select the one that most accurately reflects the way you do business.
**           Note on paddock symbol and trust marks**
We have added this because we ourselves have been asked from time to time whether our site is “safe” since we do not show any such mark. Leave it or delete it.
**           *Financial information relating only to direct debits or your credit cards* **
Provides for direct debit arrangements and explains in plain English how they work.
**           We retain your credit card information securely**
Edit the five sub paragraphs to reflect how you really do protect your financial information.
**         Credit reference**
We suggest that you leave this paragraph in place even if you have no immediate intention of liaising with debt collectors. It may be a useful reminder to users of your web site.
**         Business and personal information**
Amidst the noise about privacy we have to remember that we also have legal obligations to keep business financial records
**         *Third party advertising* **
This is a simple statement of the obvious. In practice, the demons that appear in our systems are usually cookies of some sort, placed by these third parties, often with the connivance of the webmaster of a site based far away.
**         Cookies**
Regulation of cookies is probably the single most important element of the new regulations. You must identify what cookies you use and why so as to give a user of your site notice of what you are planting on his hard disk. It is particularly important to mention any cookie that may prove objectionable to someone. The purpose of this document is to tell those who might use your web site what will happen if they do. There are thousands of possible use of cookies.  We have mentioned a few of the most obvious. Add your own. (Please tell us of any we have missed which are also obvious!)
**         to 28   **We have no comment on these paragraphs.  Select which apply to you.
29         Data may be “processed” outside the UK
It is important that this information is disclosed to comply with the law.
