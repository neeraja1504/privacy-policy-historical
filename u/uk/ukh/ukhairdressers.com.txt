What information do we collect from you?

Competitions
When you enter a competition on our site we collect your name, email address and postal address. This is so we can contact you if you win and send you your prize. Additionally, we ask you to tell us your gender and whether or not you have used the brand of products offered as the competition prize. This additional information is used to create anonymous data, to increase our understanding of who is entering our competitions; for example, the proportion of men and women entering. None of these figures are linked to any information that is personally identifiable.
If you win a prize, we will contact you by email to inform you. Your name and postal address will then be shared with the company providing the prize, so that they can send it to you. The winner's name and town of residence are recorded on a list of competition winners which we keep for our records. Once the prizes have been sent out, all other personal information from competition entrants is deleted.
