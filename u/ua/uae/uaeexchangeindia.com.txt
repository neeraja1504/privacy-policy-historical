UAE EXCHANGE Advertisers and 3rd Party Websites
Web portals AMADEUS (www.amadeus.com), Galileo (www.galileo.com) and UAE EXCHANGE (http://www.uaeexchangetravel.com/) all share a common enrollment and sign-on. Information in the customer Member Profile is shared among these portals, and each portal maintains its own privacy policy for protection of the customer personal information.
Our website and email may contain links to various other sites. While we makes every effort to ensure that our advertisers post clear and complete Privacy Policies and observe appropriate data practices, each of these sites has a privacy policy that may differ from that of ours. The privacy practices of other websites and companies are not covered by this policy.   Except as specifically set forth below, it is our policy not to provide the customer’s personally identifiable information to our advertisers unless the customer make the choice to share it with them. We occasionally pass personally identifiable information via a secure interface to certain of our advertisers for the purpose of making it easier for the customer to sign up for their offers, however, this information is only to be used by the advertiser if the customer agree to submit the information to the advertiser for the purposes of completing an offer.
We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as handling the processing and delivery of mailings, providing customer support, processing transactions, or performing statistical analysis of our services. We will only provide those companies the personal information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the customer’s information and are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.
We may share non-personally identifiable information collected in aggregate, anonymous form with advertisers or other third parties so that they may better evaluate what products and services are most appealing to different segments of our member base. We do not disclose the customer’s first name, last name, address, email address, or any other personally identifiable information to these third parties unless the customer give his express consent.
We occasionally send the information we gather about our Members to trusted third-party data processors to organize, process and/or analyze the data on our behalf. We use this information to enhance our program offerings; namely to tailor advertisements, updates, and offers to the customer particular interests and to ensure that the customer opt-out requests are honored. All such third-party data processors are prohibited from using the customer’s personal information except to provide these services to us. They are contractually bound to observe the strict policy stated herein, so the customer can rest assured that the confidentiality of the customer personally identifiable information will be maintained.

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect the customer’s personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
We reserve the right to disclose the customer’s personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our site.
