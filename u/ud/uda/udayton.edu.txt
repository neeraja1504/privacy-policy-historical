The gathering of personally identifiable information by our web sites is required in certain instances. Those instances may include: logging-in and/or customizing a site; purchasing products or services; submitting certain online forms for registration, application, or related activities; or contacting us. You will always be aware when we are gathering your personally identifiable information, as you will be entering and/or submitting that information through an online form and/or similar method. Your personally identifiable information may be used by us to provide information and services.
Information Provided by You to Divisions of UD
In certain instances, personally identifiable information that you provide and/or have provided to certain divisions of UD, for other activities such as applying for admission, registering for courses, etc., may be used by us to better serve you. In all such instances, personally identifiable information is provided and used within appropriate guidelines, and only to the extent to which it is necessary in your ability to use our web sites, and/or for us to provide you with information and services. Your personally identifiable information may be used by us to provide information and services.

UD web sites passively gather information about you. Such passive gathering may not be readily noticeable to you, and may include, but not be limited to: IP Address, domain from which you access the Internet, individual pages accessed within a UD web site, access and session times, environmental variables such as web browser, platform, and operating system, the URL from which you came, the URL you visit when leaving. This information is gathered and analyzed to enhance our web sites, detect problems, determine trends, maintain security, and overall, to assist us in improving the offering of information and services. This information is generally non-personally identifiable, however, may be combined with personally identifiable information to better provide information and services.
Cookies
To enhance the information and services provided, many of our web sites utilize "cookies."
Cookies are small text files we place on your computer, associated to your computer's web browser. These cookies do not and will never contain personally identifiable information; however, information stored in these cookies may be linked to personally identifiable information gathered in a manner as previously indicated.
As you browse University of Dayton sites, advertising cookies may be placed on your computer so that we can understand what you are interested in.  Our display advertising partners then enable us to present you with retargeted advertising on other sites based on your previous interaction with University of Dayton. The techniques our partners employ do not collect personal information such as your name, email address, postal address or telephone number.
Information UD Disseminates to Others
Information disseminated by us to any UD Division, Office and/or Official.  In certain instances, in order to provide information and services, we may disseminate both non-personally and personally identifiable information to any UD division, office, and/or official. Such instances in which we disseminate information may not be readily noticeable to you, and may include, but not be limited to: taking online exams; registering for courses; purchasing products or services; submitting certain online forms for registration, application, or related activities; or electing interests or preferences. In all such instances, personally identifiable information is disseminated and used within appropriate guidelines, and only to the extent to which it is necessary in our ability to provide information and services, and/or the ability of any UD division, office, and/or official to do the same.
Information Disseminated by Us to Strategic Partners and Others
In certain instances, we may disseminate to strategic partners and others outside UD both non-personally and personally identifiable information for research, presentation, and/or to provide information and services. In such instances information will be provided only to the extent to which it is necessary in our ability to provide information and services, and/or the ability of our strategic partners and others to do the same.
Information You Disseminated to Others
Certain UD web sites offer features that allow you to disseminate or otherwise make available your personally identifiable information to others. These features may include, but not be limited to: posting a personal profile of yourself for others; uploading personal work and then making that work available to others; or participating in specific activities related to coursework, advisement, community building, and related endeavors that are reviewed by others. You will always be aware when you are disseminating your personally identifiable information to others, as you will be entering and submitting that information through an online form and/or similar method. Also, these features will often include additional information notifying you of the extent to which any personally identifiable information will be disseminated to others.
Security
To protect the loss, misuse, theft, or otherwise unauthorized accesses of personally identifiable information, as well as the overall integrity of all information and services offered, our web sites and associated systems maintain stringent security measures.
We take technical, contractual, administrative, and physical security steps to protect personally identifiable information and associated systems. In certain instances, such as when logging-in and/or when you provide credit card information in the purchasing of products or services, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology may be further employed to protect your personally identifiable information.
Although we take appropriate measures to protect personally identifiable information, we can not guarantee that this information will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this policy.
