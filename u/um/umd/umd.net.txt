Your password is encrypted so nobody can read it, including us. When you use the chatroom, your IP address, username, and all text that you type into the chat applet (even private messages) are recorded into a logfile which only UMD site administrators can see. We use this information to help review any complaints and take action if necessary. As with all websites, every contact your browser makes with the UMD server is stored into a logfile which stores your ip address, which file you requested, and other access data. These data are necessary to serve UMD's visitors correctly and to collect anonymous statistical information.
Please be reminded that content that you post here, including text, photos, and videos, will be seen by many people.  Search engines can access it and once it's on the internet, it is indelible.  We have several features such as the private profile option and private forum posting, but we cannot control what users do who can see your content.  So use judgement when you post, and everything will be cool.
