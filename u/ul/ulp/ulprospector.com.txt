PRIVACY PRACTICES FOR REGISTERED MEMBERS
PERSONAL DATA USAGE AND PRIVACY
UL collects limited non-sensitive personal data when you register for access to the Site as a member or subscriber. No child data or convictions data is required or intentionally collected. Data collected includes: your name, your business email address, your business postal address, your business telephone number, your professional title, and interests you express in different products and services. UL then links that to data about the way you use the Site and the pages you visit.
Personal data and site usage data is processed for the following purposes. You are agreeing to these purposes when you tick the Terms and Conditions box.
UL data use that is necessary to fulfill obligations in the member and subscriber agreement:
What we do | Why we do it
---|---
Collecting personal data to create and manage a unique member account.
|
To control unrestricted access to UL proprietary content and safeguard against intellectual property theft and malicious misuse. Also to understand how different types of users interact with our sites to enable us to manage site access on-going and improve both site functionality and content.
Collecting personal data to create and manage subscriber accounts and enable payment for subscription services
|
Some premium UL site content will only be available to paid subscribers. Depending on payment means, some additional personal data may be collected to facilitate upgrade to a subscriber account, payment for subscriptions, and on-going management of subscriber accounts.
Using member and subscriber voluntary feedback provided via UL websites
|
UL places great value on the feedback provided by our customers. Your member or subscriber data will be linked to feedback provided to enable an initial response and, where you agree, invitations to participate in future feedback sessions.
Using website visitor data for web traffic analysis to enable site performance monitoring
|
Collecting data like your IP address and the kind of device you use to connect to UL sites, enables us to both protect the sites, technically tailor content, and monitor for any performance issues.
Using website visitor data linked to cookies to enable site functionality
|
UL uses cookies to enhance website functionality. Cookies allow us to remember you when you visit the site again and keep your place on pages when you navigate around content.
Marketing and Sharing Data:
UL exists to make the world a safer place, this includes helping customers and stakeholders find suppliers of products and services that meet their needs. Originally this was done via a paper directory of UL certified goods and services, now that happens via our websites. An inherent part of that business model is marketing our service and sharing customer data with UL client companies to enable their follow up sales and marketing activity. These activities are viewed as legitimate UL interests. You are agreeing to these data uses when you tick the Terms and Conditions box.
Types of recipient companies include:
Suppliers of products and services that are certified, or otherwise evaluated, by UL and listed on Product iQ
Suppliers of products and services listed on Prospector, including their partners (i.e. distributors, converters, etc.) that may send product samples or otherwise follow up on products or services the member has expressed an interest in
What we do | Why we do it
---|---
Analysing member, subscriber, and site usage data to improve site content and non-targeted marketing
|
UL will use data about members and non-members, including some personal data, to develop and improve general marketing campaigns and the way all site content is presented.
Using member and subscriber contact details to email updates about certifications, products, and services they have shown an interest in.
|
UL will periodically update both members and subscribers about products, services, and certifications that they have expressed an explicit or implicit interest in. They might have indicated such an interest by visiting relevant content on the site, requesting further information, or indicating an interest when subscribing. Note that receipt of our periodic communications is required for membership.
Sharing member, subscriber, and site usage details with UL client companies who provide products or services that the member or subscriber expressed an interest in
|
UL sells member and subscriber details to companies who provide goods and services that those members or subscribers have implicitly or explicitly expressed an interest in during site registration, or site use. Note that this use is required for membership. Members who register as consumers and do not use Product iQ in a professional capacity will not have their information used in this way.
The companies who receive those details are required to limit usage to the purposes agreed with UL at the time of collection, or notify you should there be any substantial change in planned usage.
UL using member and subscriber contact details to create direct email marketing campaigns.
|
UL will create mailing lists of members and subscribers based on the goods and services they have expressed an explicit or implicit interest in during site registration or use.
The lists will be used by UL to create direct email marketing campaigns that UL will carry out as a paid service offered to client companies. Members who register as consumers and do not use Product iQ in a professional capacity will not be part of these marketing campaigns.
Should you object to your data being shared and used in this way please either contact UL through the Contact Us button on the Site, or contact the client firm directly through the methods provided when contacting you. You may also update your preferences and your member information by accessing your Member Account page on the Site.
UL retains member data for as long as you are a member of the Site and will delete it within a reasonable period upon termination of your membership. While UL is in possession of personal data it is protected from loss, disclosure, or theft by security controls designed to mitigate existing risks. Any concerns may be addressed to our Data Privacy Director at gdpr@ul.com or you have the right to lodge a complaint with appropriate supervisory authorities.
