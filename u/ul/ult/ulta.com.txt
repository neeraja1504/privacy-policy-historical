Ulta Beauty takes your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy describes what information this Site gathers about you, how we use that information, and what steps we take to protect that information.
By using this Site, you consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy as well as the Site Terms & Conditions. Ulta Beauty may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. Please check back periodically for up-to-date information about our privacy practices.
1. INFORMATION COLLECTION
This Site collects information about you to provide and improve our services, communicate offers that we believe will interest you, and to administer our business.
Information You Provide to Us
We collect personal information from you when you submit that information to us voluntarily. For example, we collect information from you when you:
place an order on the Site;
create an account on the Site;
participate in our rewards program;
communicate with our customer service team online;
participate in an Ulta Beauty promotion, such as a sweepstakes or contest;

post a product review, question, answer, or other information on the Site;
The personal information we collect may include the following: email address, mailing/billing address, phone number, payment card number, and other payment information. Collecting this information allows us to complete your order efficiently, to notify you of your order status, and provide personalized interactions. If we ask for such information from you, we will either tell you how we will use the information or we will use it in conformity with this Privacy Policy.
We may use the personal information you provide to allow you to send message to your friends via this Site. When you use these features on our Site, you represent to us that you are entitled to use and give us your friend's name and contact information, including email address.
Information from Third Party Sources
We may collect information about you from third parties. Such information may include demographic data (like the number of members of your household, age, and gender) and purchase preference information. We may use this information to supplement or update our records, improve the quality or personalization of our communications to you, and help prevent or detect fraud.
Automated Information Collection
We automatically receive and store certain types of information when you interact with our Site, our emails, and/or our online advertisements. This information helps us to make our Site work more efficiently, evaluate use of our Site, and support our website analytics and marketing campaigns. Here are some of the types of information we may automatically receive:
Technical information like your internet protocol (IP) address, your device operating system and browser type, your referring website's address, and your clickstream through our Site
Cookies that recognize you as you use or return to our Site. The cookies allow the Site to provide you a more continuous and personalized shopping experience. Cookies are small text files that a website or email saves to your browser and stores on your hard drive.
Web beacons that allow us to know what pages on our Site have been visited, what emails have been opened, and if our banner ads have been effective.
Cookies
Our Site uses cookies. Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies to track your preferences and purchases as you navigate through our Site and to save you from having to re-enter information every time you visit our Site. By using cookies to track your visits, we can make your next shopping experience on our Site better. To search our Site and/or place an order, you need to have the cookies feature of your web browser turned on. We may also use technologies, such as our own cookies, to provide you with personalized online display advertising tailored to your interests. To opt out of our cookies used for this online advertising, click here. Most web browsers allow you to exercise control over cookies by deleting them, blocking them, or alerting you when a cookie file is stored. Please review your browser's instructions on these functions. If you choose to disable the cookies feature of your web browser, you may not be able to place an order or otherwise use some or all of the features provided on our Site. If you disable, block, or delete cookies, not all of the tracking described in this Privacy Policy will stop.
Interest-Based Advertising
We collect personal information about users over time and across different websites when you use this Site. We also have third parties that collect personal information this way. For example, we may use one or more third-party online advertising networks to serve ads on our behalf on third party websites. The third-party ad network may collect information about your visits to our Site and your interaction with our online ads. For example, it may keep track of how many of our ads you saw before visiting our Site. This is primarily accomplished using technology such as cookies, action tags, web beacons, and/or GIF tags which are placed in various places within our Site and our online ads.
We may share information with third-party ad networks in an aggregate form to help us analyze and improve our Site and our online ads. The third-party ad networks may use information about your visit to our Site and other websites in order to provide you with ads about goods and services that may be of interest to you. For example, if you browse for information about mascara products on our Site or on third party websites, we or the online ad network may show you ads for mascara products. If you would like more information about this practice or the process of opting out of online ad networks, please visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp. If you opt-out of interest-based ads, you will still see ads on websites you visit, but those ads will not be based on your browsing behavior.
Some browsers have a 'do not track' feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. These features are not yet uniform, so our Site is not currently designed to respond to those signals.
Wi-Fi Service, Mobile Applications and Website
When you download or use our in-store WiFi service, mobile application or mobile website, we may receive information about your location and your mobile device. This information may include the type of mobile device you use, the temporary or persistent unique device identifier (UDID) placed by us or our service providers, the unique identifier assigned by Ulta Beauty to your device, the IP address of your device, your mobile operating system, the type of mobile web browser you use, and data from the way you use our mobile application/website.
Our in-store WiFi service/mobile application/website may also collect information about the location of your device.

We and our service providers may use this information, along with other information submitted by you, to provide you with location-based services like local store information, search results, special offers, and other personalized content.
Most mobile devices allow users to disable location services by using controls located in the device's settings menu. If you have questions about how to disable your device's location services, please contact your mobile service carrier or your device manufacturer. You may also stop collection of information by our mobile application by uninstalling the mobile application using the standard uninstall process available as part of your mobile device.

You may also disclose your own personal information on interactive services such as message boards, product reviews, question-and-answer pages, profile pages, and social network features offered by us or by third parties.

Please exercise caution when deciding whether to disclose your personal information, location, or similar information via this Site.
We may disclose the information we collect about you (including personally identifiable information) to third parties to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and/or governmental requests.

Such entities may receive personally identifiable information to allow them to perform their duties, but they may not use that information for any other purpose. In some instances, we may share non-identifying and aggregate information collected on our Site with third parties, such as our merchandise vendors and service providers.
The use, disclosure, and sharing of "Virtual Beauty Information" is governed by the Virtual Beauty Try-On Additional Terms and Conditions in the Site Terms & Conditions.
3. SECURING YOUR INFORMATION
Ulta Beauty works to protect your personal information and credit card detail when you shop with us online. We use Transport Layer Security (TLS) technology - the industry standard - to encrypt the personal information and credit card detail you provide during the order process.
To ensure the security of your personal information, you should always provide that information over a secure connection. You can check the existence of a secure connection in one of two ways:
(1) Look at the URL in your web browser. Whenever you are connected to a secure server, that connection will be represented in the URL as "https," rather than "http."
(2) Look at your web browser. You have an SSL connection if you see a closed lock or a solid key. If you click on this image, a small pop-up window displaying website security information will appear.
We urge you to protect your own privacy. We recommend that you do not share your Site password(s) with anyone or in any unsolicited phone call or e-mail.
While our Site strives to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, Ulta Beauty cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party hackers from illegally obtaining this information.
