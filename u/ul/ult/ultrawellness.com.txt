Privacy Policy
Welcome to the website located at http://store.drhyman.com (the "Website"), developed and operated by Vitamin Portfolio, LLC, a Massachusetts limited liability company ("Sponsor", "we", "our", or "us"). This Privacy Policy is intended to inform you about how Sponsor collects and uses your personally identifiable information ("PII") and other information in operating the Website.
How does the Website Work?
The Website provides visitors to the Website ("Visitors", "you" or "your") and other individuals who are at least eighteen (18) years of age to access our store. By participating in the Website, you consent to the collection and use of your PII by Sponsor as described herein. Sponsor reserves the right to change how we handle the information we collect and process through the Website at any time. We will update this Privacy Policy to reflect any changes and such changes will take effect immediately once posted.
What type of PII does Sponsor collect from you and how do we use it?
Visitors must provide certain PII to Sponsor in order to make purchases on the Website. Such PII includes basic shipping and billing information, such as your name, address, phone number and credit card number. By providing us such information you represent and warrant its veracity.
Sponsor may provide your PII to entities who work on behalf of or with us. These entities may use your PII to help fulfill your requests in connection with the Website. For instance, we may transfer information collected at checkout, including PII, to service providers and other third parties who assist us in billing and order fulfillment.
Other than with Sponsor’s related companies, Sponsor will not share your PII for direct marketing or other purposes.
Under what other circumstances may we release PII?
We may also release your PII if we believe such release is necessary to comply with the law (e.g., a legal process or a statutory authorization), to apply or enforce our customer agreements, to protect our rights or property, to protect Visitors from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of the Website, or if we reasonably believe that a danger to any person requires disclosure of such PII.
What other information does Sponsor collect?
We also collect anonymous and aggregate information from you about your preferences in navigating the Website by using cookies, action tags and other methods. Cookies are small text files that identify your computer. We may use cookies to, among other things, monitor Website usage, customize Website features, identify your computer's operating system and browser, and complete transactions. An action tag is a small, graphic image on a webpage that is designed to allow the website owner or a third party to monitor who is visiting a website by collecting the IP address of the computer to which the tag is sent, the URL of the webpage that the tag comes from and the time that such webpage was viewed. Tags may be associated with cookie information. We may also use such anonymous and aggregate information for promotional purposes. If you do not want to be identified by us, you can set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies and refuse cookies when your browser alerts you to their presence. You can also adjust the settings in your browser to refuse all cookies.
How do we store information?
Sponsor takes reasonable steps consistent with industry standards to assure that PII collected at checkout is secured from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, and destruction in storage while under our control. Please note that despite our efforts to safeguard information provided to us, we cannot guarantee that such information will not be disclosed or accessed by accidental circumstances or by the unauthorized acts of others.
What are our policies regarding children?
You must be eighteen (18) years of age or older to order from this Website.
Do we have a mechanism to address the removal of PII and complaints about the handling of information that we collect?
If you wish to remove PII that you have submitted to Sponsor, please send us an email requesting such removal to support@drhyman.com. If you have questions or concerns about any of our information collection or handling practices, please contact us at 1-888-702-2995.
