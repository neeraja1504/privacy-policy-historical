This is a standard practice in online security and prevents the use of your credit card for placement of fraudulent orders by others.

What is GDPR? The European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a set of regulations coming into effect on May 25, 2018 that enhance the data privacy rights of EU individuals and unify data privacy protections within the EU. The scope of the GDPR covers companies operating in the EU, as well as companies operating outside the EU who offer services to, or monitor the behavior of, EU residents.
How does GDPR apply to IDM Computer Solutions, Inc.?
The GDPR sets out obligations on 1) Data Controllers, or those that determine the purpose and means of the processing of personal data of EU residents, and 2) Data Processors, or those that process personal data of EU residents on behalf of Data Controllers.
For most of IDM operations, IDM is a Data Controller, that is we store customer software license information in order to support our registered users. IDM is also a Data Processor, as we employ third ecommerce providers (2Checkout.com and Cleverbridge.com) to process online credit card transactions. It is IDMs responsibility to ensure these ecommerce providers are GDPR compliance and we have done so.
IDM as a Data Controller. IDM is a Data Controller with respect to license data collected when a customer registers an IDM software product. When individuals in the EU buy our products online, they provide our ecommerce providers with information needed such as credit card details, address, email, full name, and phone number (if provided). Post transaction, IDM is provided ONLY the license information such as customer/organization name, email address, product registration code, date purchased and quantity. Our ecommerce provider never shares personal information such as Credit card information with IDM. Nor does IDM store any such information on its secure internal or cloud servers. We share this data with registered users who request their license information in the event they have lost their registration code or have to restore an application due to a computer failure. Any data we store is for the sole use of supporting our registered users and is available upon request.
IDM as a Data Processor. IDM is a Data Processor with respect to using a third party to conduct online transactions on our behalf. The personal data collected (such as accredit card numbers) by our third-party ecommerce providers (2Checkout.com and Cleverbridge.com) to process online credit card transactions, is NOT shared with IDM. It is however IDMs responsibility to ensure these ecommerce providers are GDPR compliance and we have done so.
What is IDM doing to foster compliance with GDPR?
IDM is committed to GDPR compliance across our products, support, and services.
Security. Over the past year, IDM undertook a complete internal and external (cloud) security overhaul and upgrade. These actions include new managed firewalls to govern internal/external access to the Network/Internet. We migrated to an entirely new managed cloud array for download, upgrade, and web services. And lastly, IDM engaged CA Veracode to certify our products Veracode Verified, thus ensuring our products are hardened, pressure tested and secure.
Consent. Customers who submit their personal data to us, or to our third-party ecommerce providers, (for example by purchasing our software products online), affirmatively consent to IDM or its third-party processing agent, use of their personal data in accordance with the privacy policies on our web sites.
What should you be doing as a customer of IDM?
Companies subject to the GDPR are responsible for ensuring their own compliance and you should seek legal counsel to assist you with this. As a current or future customer of IDM, you are responsible for ensuring your use of our services is compliant with the GDPR. When IDM acts as a Data Processor on your behalf, you are responsible for ensuring data you share with us complies with the GDPR.
When IDM acts as a Data Controller on your behalf, we are responsible for ensuring that our privacy policy and GDPR compliance, (along with any other applicable data protection laws) affords you, our customer, the privacy and data protection as governed by law and/or your consent.
IDM will promptly update privacy policies posted on such sites to incorporate any changes required by our customers.
