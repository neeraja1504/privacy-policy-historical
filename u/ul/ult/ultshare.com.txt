We may disclose in aggregate form our statistical analyses or demographics of users to third parties, such as advertisers or potential advertisers. Those disclosures do not include personal information. JumboFiles.com might use information collected in connection with your participation in interactive activities, including account registration, for its own internal purposes, such as (by way of illustration) to respond to inquiries, to enforce the Terms of Use, or to defend itself in the event of litigation. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. We also can use the IP address to verify the identity of perpetrators of illegal activity.
Other Disclosures to Third Parties - subpoenas, court and government orders, our attorneys.
JumboFiles.com will not distribute or sell any of your personal information to third parties. However, by using this site's services, you assume the risk that a court or government agency may order JumboFiles.com to disclose your submission and/or personally identifying information about you, or that a litigant, a court, a grand jury, or government agency may subpoena that information. We do not disclose the identities of ours users unless we are legally required to do so. If a governmental agency (for example, law enforcement agencies, US Attorneys' offices or similar governmental agencies) sends us a subpoena, we will comply with it. We will attempt to notify you of such a subpoena or other legal process by sending a notice by electronic mail to the most recent e-mail address you have provided to us. The notice will include basic information concerning the subpoena, court order, or legal process (i.e., name of lawsuit, case number, place of filing, party issuing subpoena, the court where the subpoena was issued, contact information, deadline by which we plan to comply with the process, etc.). JumboFiles.com may need to consult its own attorneys. In doing so, JumboFiles.com may disclose personal information to its attorneys.
