Ulule Privacy Policy
(last updated 25 May 2018)Version V.2.0
Essential information on the processing of your personal data by Ulule
Ulule SAS develops and operates the Ulule crowdfunding platform. It puts project creators ("project owners") in contact with people wishing to support projects by making a financial contribution ("contributors"). Within the framework of these activities, we process personal data concerning you, whether you are a visitor to the website Ulule.com or a user (registered member, contributor or project owner).
−         The data processing manager is Ulule, a simplified joint-stock company with an authorised capital of €253,061, registered under number 794 710 830 in the Paris trade and companies register, having its head office at 8 rue Saint-Fiacre, 75002 Paris, FRANCE.
−         We collect and process your data in order to: manage our contractual and pre-contractual relations with users and future users, manage user accounts, enable the hosting and administration of fundraising events, commercial management and user relations, provide our services, including the user support service, promote our services and products and propose new services and products to you, carry out training and events linked with our services and products, manage the Ulule.com websites, host and manage opinions and comments, host and manage the Community forum, compile commercial performance statistics, analyse and follow the audiences of our sites and facilitate their browsing as well as those of our dedicated pages on the social media (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter and YouTube), combat fraud, money laundering and the financing of terrorism, manage any outstanding payments, pre-litigation and litigation cases, manage the exercise of your rights, and manage any reports and notifications linked with content published on our websites or forum.
−         Certain data concerning you may be combined. This may consist of data you communicate when using our Ulule.com websites and data gathered through cookies on the Internet (we invite you to read our Cookies Policy). Data combined in this way are then used for some of the above-mentioned purposes.
−         Some data is processed to make decisions as to the acceptance/refusal of a project or contribution. In connection with their legal obligation to combat fraud, money laundering and financing of terrorism, Ulule and its payment service providers (MANGOPAY and STRIPE) process data, including data combinations, to help their staff establish fraud risk levels concerning payments and fundraising events. This processing may be used to justify a decision taken by Ulule or MANGOPAY or STRIPE to refuse a fundraising event, but no decision is made without human intervention.
−         It can happen that you communicate so-called sensitive data on our sites: when you publish a project, fill in your user profile, participate in a project, or publish a comment or an article on our Community Forum, you can publicly reveal highly personal information (religious or philosophical convictions, sexual preference, political opinions, state of health, etc.). We thus recommend extreme caution when you describe your project or user profile, post comments or articles on the forum or participate in a project, in order to protect your privacy. It is also possible in certain cases to make "anonymous" contributions (see our online aid concerning this point – your identity will only be known to Ulule and the project owner concerned).
−         As a project owner, in particular, you may communicate information concerning third parties (your staff, a person your project is designed to help, etc.). The processing of these data must comply with the regulations. You should check that you have the right to communicate these data to Ulule and to the public (for example, by obtaining the written agreement of these third parties) and communicate information to these parties on Ulule's processing of the data as indicated in this Privacy Policy.
−         It is obligatory to collect certain data. We need certain information to provide you with our services. Whenever we collect data through forms, the obligatory or optional nature of your answers is made clear in each form. The consequences of not providing an answer for an obligatory response depend on the situation. It will mainly mean that you cannot create an account, submit or contribute to a project, or benefit from some of our services (the requirement to provide information is contractual or regulatory in this case if the information required is connected with our legal obligations as a crowdfunding platform), and that we cannot meet requests from you concerning the exercise of your rights (the requirement to provide information in this case is regulatory).
−         The parties who may receive data from Ulule are mainly our subcontractors, project owners, Ulule partners, if your project is participating in a partner operation, and the judicial and administrative authorities.
−         You have rights. These consist of the right to access, correct , delete and restrict processing, the right to object to the processing of your data, the right to define, modify and revoke instructions governing what happens to your data after your death, and the right to lodge a complaint with the CNIL (French data protection authority). Subject to providing proof your identity and complying with the conditions imposed by current legislation, you can exercise these rights by writing to us at the following email address: privacy@ulule.com onto this postal address: ULULE SAS, 8 rue Saint Fiacre, 75002 Paris, FRANCE.
−      The periods for which we store your data vary according to the nature of the data concerned, the purposes for which they were collected and the legal limitation period (generally five years from the time when persons wishing to exercise a right have had or should have had knowledge of the facts enabling them to exercise the right), except in the case of pre-litigation or litigation.
−      Your data may be transferred outside the European Union. We will transfer certain data to our subcontractors, partners or service providers, such as our hosters, email dispatch management tools, etc. If they are transferred outside the European Union, we make every effort to ensure that they are transferred to countries where the personal data protection level has been recognised as adequate by the European Commission, or that the European Commission's standard contractual clauses apply to our service providers or partners.
−      We have appointed a data protection officer, who can be contacted at dpo@ulule.com or at the following postal address: ULULE SAS, Data Protection Officer, 8 rue Saint Fiacre, 75002 Paris, FRANCE.
For further information, we invite you to read the Privacy Policy below.
This Privacy Policy (the "Privacy Policy") defines the conditions in which Ulule collects and processes personal data concerning you as visitors or users of the Ulule platform, accessible at the address https://fr.ulule.com/.

In a concern to respect your private life and protect data concerning you, we comply with current legislation in terms of personal data protection, particularly French Data Protection Act no. 78-17 of 6 January 1978 (hereinafter the French Data Protection Act) and European regulation 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and the free movement of such data, known as the General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR (hereinafter the "GDPR").
We may update this Privacy Policy. You will be informed of any significant updates in advance, and if necessary, we will obtain your consent.
1.                    Which data do we collect and process?
As processing manager, we collect and process personal data concerning you.
In this respect, we collect data from you as a user of our Ulule platform to identify and contact you (full name, email address, postal address, telephone number), validate the posting online of your projects and organised the collection of contributions (information on your profile, information on your project, bank information, etc.).
We also collect data concerning your use of our services, as well as data when you browse our websites and our dedicated pages on the social media. To this end, we collect the data needed to compile audience statistics, performance measurements and commercial prospecting.
We collect data on your exchanges with us concerning our services and the requests you send us, including the management of your rights and your instructions in the event of death.
Lastly, we collect data enabling us to meet our obligations in terms of combatting fraud, money laundering and the financing of terrorism, ands managing your rights and pre-litigation and litigation cases. In this respect, we notably collect documents proving your identity.
All these data can be communicated by you when you complete our forms or during our exchanges. They can also be collected through computer tools such as cookies. For more information on our use of these tools, we recommend that you read the cookies policy available here: Cookies Policy.
All the data concerning you that we collect can be combined for the purposes below.
IMPORTANT – SENSITIVE DATA
Sensitive data and user profile: The following fields in your user profile are optional and designed so that you can personalise your public user profile on Ulule: full name, town, description, comprehensive description, social media and websites. Via these fields, you can publicly reveal information about you that is sometimes sensitive or highly personal, (religious or philosophical convictions, sexual preference, political opinions, state of health, etc.). Once the form is validated this information becomes public and available to everyone. We thus recommend caution in describing your user profile, to protect your privacy.
Sensitive data and project pages /publication of news about your project: When you describe a project or publish news on your project page, you can reveal information about you that is sometimes sensitive or highly personal (religious or philosophical convictions, sexual preference, political opinions, state of health, etc.). If your project is posted online or your news is published, this sensitive information becomes public and available to everyone. Ulule thus recommends caution in describing your project and drafting your news, to protect your privacy.
Sensitive data and contributions to a project: By default, contributions are public and can be seen in the list of a project's contributors or the user profile of a member contributor. The fact of contributing to a project can sometimes reveal sensitive or highly personal information (religious or philosophical convictions, sexual preference, political opinions, state of health, etc.). For example, by contributing to a project with a political dimension, you indirectly reveal your political opinions. If you do not wish your support to be public, Ulule allows you to make your contribution "anonymous": go to your user profile/ “my contributions” / “change address and preferences”. Your identity will then only be known to Ulule and the project owner concerned. To make all your contributions "anonymous", go to your user profile / “preferences” / “confidentiality”.
Sensitive data and comments on projects or publications on the Community forum: When you write a comment on a project, a news item published on a project or an article on the Community forum, you can reveal information about yourself that is sometimes sensitive or highly personal (religious or philosophical convictions, sexual preference, political opinions, state of health, etc.). Once the comment or Community publication form is validated, this sensitive information becomes public and available to everyone. Ulule thus recommends caution when writing your comments or publications on the Community forum, to protect your privacy.
IMPORTANT – THIRD-PARTY DATA
When you write a project presentation or a news item, you can communicate to us,, and publicly communicate information concerning third parties (your staff, a person your project is designed to aid, etc.).
These data must be processed in compliance with the regulations.
You should check that you have the right to communicate this data to Ulule and the public (for example, by obtaining written consent from these third parties) and provide them with information on how Ulule processes their data, as indicated in this Privacy Policy.
