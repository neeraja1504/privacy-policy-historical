INFORMATION COLLECTED
We collect the following types of information from our users:

: Like many technology providers, we use common internet technologies such as cookies to keep track of users’ interactions with the Products, including your internet protocol (IP) address, browser type and access times, data related to your use of the App and the device on which the App is loaded. We also contract with third party providers who use similar tracking tags on the Products via SDKs, to collect information about your use of the Products, for advertising, analytics, and measurement purposes. More about this is discussed below.
: If you post information on public areas via the Products (or elsewhere on the internet), that information is public and may be collected, stored and used by anyone, including us.
: The Products utilize certain API “feeds” or other mechanisms provided by third parties, notably Twitter (“Third Party Apps”), to access your accounts as authorized by you during your set up and use of the Products. Those Third Party Apps may share information about you with us, depending upon the privacy settings you have set within your account for such Third Party Apps.  The Third Party App settings enabled by you do not allow us to access content, data or information not authorized by those privacy settings. Please refer to the privacy settings in your Third Party Apps account to manage your public profile and other aspects of your account with those Third Party Apps.
: If you consent to allow access to your geo location on the Products, and the Products are location enabled, we will collect and store information related to your mobile device location including over time to help provide a better experience with our Products and in connection with our advertising, analytics, and measurement services.  Some functional use of the Products may be dependent on the data related to your geographic location and geo-positional data (such as when you post a tweet from or about a location). If the settings on your location-aware device allow us to receive location information, we may also associate location information with other information we have about you. You are always free to turn off geolocation on your device (or limit it to certain Apps).
. The Products display advertisements (“Ads”) which are delivered by UberMedia’s services and through third party providers.  When Ads are served, information regarding your interaction with the Ads shown to you is collected by the  third party advertising exchange partners as described in the next section.
INTEREST BASED ADVERTISING

This data is used to help choose which Ads to deliver and to enhance our advertising and analytics capabilities as well as to offer analytics measurement and data enhancement services to our partners for their marketing and advertising purposes.  When the Products are location enabled, and you have consented to enabling access to your geo location data on the Products, UberMedia will collect and process your location data over time and use this data in connection with the advertising, measurement and attribution services as described herein. To the extent UberMedia makes available geo-location to third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy, it will be provided without identifying you personally.
