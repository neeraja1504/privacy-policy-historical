Privacy Policy - Uber Zon Club
UberZon Club (" UberZon Club ") operates UberZonClub.com and may operate other websites. It is UberZon Club's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.
Website Visitors
Like most website operators, UberZon Club collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. UberZon Club's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how UberZon Club's visitors use its website. From time to time, UberZon Club may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
UberZon Club also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on UberZonClub.com blogs/sites. UberZon Club only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog/site where the comment was left.
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to UberZon Club's websites choose to interact with UberZon Club in ways that require UberZon Club to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that UberZon Club gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up at UberZonClub.com to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with UberZon Club are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, UberZon Club collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with UberZon Club. UberZon Club does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
Aggregated Statistics
UberZon Club may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. UberZon Club may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, UberZon Club does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
UberZon Club discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on UberZon Club's behalf or to provide services available at UberZon Club's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using UberZon Club's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. UberZon Club will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, UberZon Club discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when UberZon Club believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of UberZon Club, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an UberZon Club website and have supplied your email address, UberZon Club may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with UberZon Club and our products. If you send us a request (for example via email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. UberZon Club takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
