• We may disclose to third parties, and/or use in our Services,
"Aggregated Phenotypic and Self-Reported Information", which is
Phenotypic and Self-Reported Information that has been stripped of

Information to third-party non-profit and/or commercial research partners
who will not publish that information in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.
•  Except as otherwise set forth herein, we will never release your
individual-level Phenotypic and/or Self-Reported Information to a third
party without asking for and receiving your explicit consent to do so,
unless required by law.

of our website, for R&D, for quality control, to improve our Services,

be used and disclosed to third parties in aggregate form for uBiome
Research intended to be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals.
•  If you do not give consent to participate in uBiome Research, we may
still use your Web Behavior Information for R&D purposes as described
above, which may include disclosure of aggregated Web Behavior
Information to third-party non-profit and/or commercial research partners
who will not publish that information in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.
