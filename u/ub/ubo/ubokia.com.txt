Privacy Policy
Updated March 2012
Introduction
The Ubokia.com website (the " Site ") is operated by Ubokia.com, Inc. (" Ubokia "). Ubokia is committed to respecting and protecting the privacy of our users and others who visit and use the Site (individually, " You " or collectively, " Users "). To that end, we have prepared this privacy policy (" Privacy Policy ") to describe what information we gather from you, how we use that information, in what instances we may disclose it to third parties, and what we do to protect it. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the Ubokia Terms of Service. Your use of the Site and any personal information you provide on, or in connection with your use of, the Site are subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy and Ubokia's Terms of Service. By using or accessing the Site, you expressly consent to the information handling practices described in this policy.
The Information Ubokia Collects:
User-Provided Information: When you register for the Site, you may provide what is generally called "Personally Identifiable Information" (such as your name, email address, postal or other physical address, home/mobile telephone number). To participate in certain activities and to obtain certain services offered on the Site, you may be asked to provide additional Personally Identifiable Information. We endeavor to limit our requests for Personally Identifiable Information to information we believe is reasonably necessary to achieve our purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you will not be able to register as a User and might not be able to take advantage of many of the Site's features.
"Automatically Collected" Information: We also automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, web browser or device type, cookie information (as described below) and the page you request.
Cookies: Some of the pages on the Site may contain "cookies." A cookie is a small data file that may be sent to your Web browser and stored on your computer. This allows our server to "recognize" you when your computer visits the Site in the future. Most Web browsers can be configured to not accept cookies, or to notify you if a cookie is sent to you. In some instances, Ubokia may collect non-Personally Identifiable Information (aggregate or demographic data) through cookies.
Information from Other Sources: We may also obtain information, including personally identifiable information, from third parties and sources other than the Ubokia Site. If we combine or associate information from other sources with personally identifiable information that we collect through the Site, we will treat the combined information as personally identifiable information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

When Ubokia Discloses Information:
Your privacy is important to us, and we are not in the business of selling your information. We do, however, disclose your personally identifiable information in a variety of circumstances in connection with developing and maintaining the Site and operating our business. For example:
Ubokia works with third party service providers in the U.S. and other jurisdictions to provide website development, hosting, maintenance, transcription, and support as well as other business services for us. To the extent it is necessary for these service providers to complete their work; these third parties may have access to or process your personally identifiable information. These disclosures are generally made under terms comparable to this policy, and the recipients are limited to using the information the purpose for which it was provided.
Ubokia enables users to communicate in a variety of ways. Any personally identifiable information that you voluntarily choose to include in a publicly accessible area on the Site, such as in a listing, comment, posting, Group WANT, or other User Postings that you upload and share, will be available to other users who access that content.
Ubokia enables users to acquire goods and services from third-party Merchants. If you choose to purchase any such goods and services through the Ubokia Site, the third-party Merchant responsible for such goods and services may have access to your personally identifiable information to the extent necessary to support and redeem the applicable order. While Ubokia generally requires Merchants to agree to protect usersâ€™ personal information under terms comparable to this policy, you understand that Ubokia cannot guarantee the manner in which such Merchants may use or further disclose your personal information received in connection with your use of the Ubokia Site.
Ubokia may disclose automatically collected and other aggregate non-personally-identifiable information with interested third parties, to assist such parties in understanding the usage, viewing, and demographic patterns for certain programs, content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on the Site.
Ubokia may also disclose your information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary or useful to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright law), to respond to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena or warrant, or to otherwise cooperate with law enforcement activity.
In the event that Ubokia is acquired by or merged with a third-party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information that we have collected from Users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control.

Any person who provides information to us through registration or in any other manner on the Site represents to Ubokia that they are 18 years of age or older. If we learn that a child under 18 has submitted personal information to us without verifiable parental consent, we will take the appropriate steps to delete the information. If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under the age of 18 has obtained a Site account, then you may alert Ubokia and request that Ubokia delete that child's personal information from its systems.
