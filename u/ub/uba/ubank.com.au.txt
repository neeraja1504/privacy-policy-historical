How we collect and hold your information
There are many ways we seek information from you. We might collect your information when you fill out a form with us, when you’ve given us a call, used our websites or dropped into one of our branches. In addition, when you use our website or mobile applications we may collect information about your IP address, location or activity. We also find using electronic means, such as email or SMS, a convenient way to communicate with you and to verify your details, including doing e-verification of identity (e-Know Your Customer). However we’ll never ask you for your security details in this way – if you are ever unsure, just contact us. We will try to collect personal information directly from you unless it’s unreasonable or impracticable. For this reason, it’s important that you keep your contact details up-to-date.
How we collect your information from other sources
Sometimes we collect information about you from other sources. We may collect information about you that is publicly available (for example from public registers or social media) or made available by third parties. For instance, we do this where:
we distribute or arrange products on behalf of others, including our business partners;
we can’t get hold of you and need to update your contact details;
we need information from third parties about an application you make through us;
we need information for fraud prevention purposes;
we are checking the security you are offering;
we can learn insight about your financial needs, such as through property information;
you have consented to third parties sharing it with us, such as organisations we have loyalty programs with or we sponsor;
at your request, we exchange information with your legal or financial advisers or other representatives.
We may use or disclose information about you in order to combine the information that we hold with information collected from or held by external sources. We do this in order to enable the development of customer insights about you so that we can serve you better. This includes being able to better understand your preferences and interests, personalise your experience, enhance the products and services you receive, and to tell you about products and services that may be of interest to you. Where those insights are provided to others, such insights are based on aggregated information and do not contain any information that identifies you. We may also use service providers to undertake the process of creating these consumer insights.
What if you don’t want to provide us with your personal information?
If you don’t provide your personal information to us, we may not be able to:
provide you with the product or service you want;
manage or administer your product or service;
verify your identity or protect against fraud; or
let you know about other products or services from across the Group that might better meet your financial, e-commerce and lifestyle needs.
How we collect and hold your credit information
We will collect your credit information from details included in your application for credit (whether paper based, phone or electronic). In addition to what we say above about collecting information from other sources, other main sources for collecting credit information are:
credit reporting bodies and other credit providers;
your co-loan applicants or co-borrowers, as well as your guarantors/proposed guarantors;
your employer, accountant, real estate agent or other referees;
your agents and other representatives like your referrers, brokers, solicitors, conveyancers and settlement agents;
organisations that help us to process credit applications such as mortgage managers;
organisations that check the security you are offering such as valuers;
organisations involved in the securitisation of our loans such as loan servicers, trust managers, trustees and security trustees;
organisations providing lenders mortgage insurance and title insurance to us or our related lenders;
bodies that issue identification documents to help us check your identity; and
our service providers involved in helping us to provide credit or to administer credit products, including our debt collectors and our legal advisers.
What do we do when we get information we didn’t ask for?
Where we receive unsolicited information, we will check whether that information is reasonably necessary for our functions or activities. If it is, we’ll handle this information the same way we do with other information we seek from you. If not, we’ll ensure we do the right thing and destroy or de-identify it.
When will we notify you that we have received your information?
When we receive personal information from you, we’ll take reasonable steps to notify you how and why we collected your information, who we may disclose it to and outline how you can access it, seek correction of it or make a complaint.
Where we collect your personal information from third parties we will take reasonable steps to notify you of the circumstances of that collection. We recommend our customers regularly review our website to review updates to this policy and our Privacy Notification.
How do we take care of your personal information?
We store information in different ways, including in paper and electronic form. The security of your personal information is important to us and we take reasonable steps to protect it from misuse, interference and loss, and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. Some of the ways we do this are:
confidentiality requirements and privacy training of our employees;
document storage security policies;
security measures to control access to our systems and premises;
only giving access to personal information to a person who is verified to be able to receive that information;
ensuring third parties meet NAB Group’s privacy obligations; and
electronic security systems, such as firewalls and data encryption on our websites.
We can store personal information physically or electronically with third party data storage providers. Where we do this, we use contractual arrangements to ensure those providers take appropriate measures to protect that information and restrict the uses to which they can put that information.
What happens when we no longer need your information?
We’ll only keep your information for as long as we require it for our purposes. We’re also required to keep some of your information for certain periods of time under law, such as the Corporations Act, the Anti-Money Laundering & Counter-Terrorism Financing Act, and the Financial Transaction Reports Act for example. When we no longer require your information, we’ll ensure that your information is destroyed or de-identified.
