How do we collect and store information from you?
UBS uses tracking technology such as cookies or tags to gather information as outlined above (see: "What information do we collect from you and for what purpose?") to understand how visitors use the UBS Website.
Tracking technology helps us manage and improve the usability of the UBS Website, for example by detecting whether there has been any contact between your computer and us in the past and to identify the most popular sections of the UBS Website.
Where available, the “Cookies” link at the bottom of the page gives you more details about UBS’s use of cookies, and lets you control which types of cookies the UBS Website may set on your device (known as your “cookie settings”). Please ensure that you set your cookie settings by un-ticking certain types of cookies if you do not consent to their use by UBS.
When you save your cookie settings, they should also apply to your future visits to the UBS Website. However, for technical reasons beyond UBS’s control, this cannot be guaranteed. For example, if you reset your browser, delete your cookies or access the UBS website from another browser or device your cookie settings may be lost. To comply with applicable laws and regulations, in some countries you may be asked to confirm your cookie settings when you first visit the UBS Website. If you are in a country where you are automatically required to set your cookie settings, you may be asked to set them again on a future visit.
In many cases you can also control tracking technologies using your browser. Please ensure that your browser setting reflects whether you wish to be warned about and/or accept tracking technologies (such as cookies) where possible. The specific capabilities of your browser and instructions on how to use them can usually be found in the manual or help file of your browser.

To whom do we disclose your information collected from the UBS Website?
UBS may disclose your information to its affiliates and its and their agents and third party providers inside or outside your country of residence to perform services for UBS and for the purposes stated above. Our affiliates, agents and third party providers who have access to personal data obtained through the UBS Website are obliged to respect privacy.
When transferring personal data internationally we make sure that we comply with applicable laws and regulations, for example, by entering into agreements which will ensure that the recipients of your information maintain an adequate level of data protection.
We may also disclose your information to governmental agencies or entities, regulatory authorities, or other persons in line with any applicable law, regulations, court order or official request, or under any and for the purposes of any guidelines issued by regulatory or other authorities, or similar processes as either required or permitted by applicable law.
What security measures have we implemented to protect your information collected through the UBS Website?
UBS has implemented reasonable technical and organisational security measures to protect your personal data collected by UBS via the UBS Website against unauthorized access, misuse, loss or destruction.
How do we treat electronic messages sent to and from UBS?
All electronic messages sent to and from UBS are automatically retained in a distinct journaling system which preserves the evidential weight of the e-mails. They are protected by reasonable technical and organisational measures and may only be accessed in justified cases in line with applicable laws and regulations (e.g. court order, suspicion of criminal conduct, violation of regulatory obligations, material breach of employment contract) to specific persons in defined functions (e.g. Legal, Compliance, Risk). Every step of the process, as well as the search criteria used, are logged in an audit trail. All emails are disposed of after the applicable retention period has expired.
What should you consider when sending data over the Internet?
The Internet is generally not regarded as a secure environment, and information sent via the Internet (such as to or from the UBS Website or via electronic message) may be accessed by unauthorized third parties, potentially leading to disclosures, changes in content or technical failures. Even if both sender and receiver are located in the same country, information sent via the Internet may be transmitted across international borders and be forwarded to a country with a lower data protection level than exists in your country of residence.
Please note that we accept no responsibility or liability for the security of your information whilst in transit over the Internet to UBS. In order to protect your privacy we would like to remind you that you may choose another means of communication with UBS, where you deem it appropriate.
