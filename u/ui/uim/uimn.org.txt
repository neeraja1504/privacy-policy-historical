**Privacy Statement for the
Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development Websites ***
The Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development (DEED) websites provide an electronic means for accessing information about the programs and services available through DEED. Web pages are continually under development as we attempt to keep our content as current as possible.
DEED is committed to protecting the privacy of users in accordance with Minn. Stat. § 13, the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act; this privacy statement explains how. We reserve the right to alter our privacy policy as business needs require. Any changes to this policy will be posted on this website in a timely manner.

We recommend that you not use email to send us private or sensitive data about yourself or others unless the data is encoded or encrypted. Also, users are cautioned that the collection of personal information requested from or volunteered by children online or by email will be treated the same as information given by an adult and may be subject to public access.
