Privacy Policy | University of Fort Hare
Maintaining the privacy of our users is vital.
Our systems also hold proprietary data and intellectual property that's been developed and gathered by faculty and student researchers.
University of Fort Hare sites follow these policies and best practices, but they can't be construed as a contractual promise. University of Fort Hare reserves the right to amend the university Internet Privacy Policy statement at any time without notice.
University of Fort Hare respects the privacy of people who visit our website and choose to share personal information with the university. We take all reasonable steps to ensure that data stays confidential and secure.
Information We Collect
When someone accesses a University of Fort Hare web site, some information is collected automatically:
The Internet domain and Internet address of the computer (routing information).
Identification of the requested page or service.
Type of browser and operating system.
Date and time of access.
Internet address of any outside website from which the user linked directly to our website.
Routing information is used to send the requested web page to the user's computer via our Internet service provider or other entities involved in transmitting pages, which have their own privacy practices. Other technical information helps us respond to your request with the right format.
We also collect information that users choose to send, including :
Name, email address, and the content of emails.
Data submitted through online forms.
User IDs and passwords submitted through administrative systems are encrypted before transmission across the network and stored in a secure environment. Applications that process credit card payments encrypt card numbers and expiration dates using a secure server, which is not accessible from the Internet.
Although University of Fort Hare might keep your information indefinitely, most transaction routing information is deleted from our web server within 60 days after the page is transmitted. We don't obtain any information to link it to the individuals who browse our web site. Information that we do retain includes:
Routing information logs to aid law enforcement agencies if hackers attempt to breach security.
Transaction routing information for statistical summaries to assess site content and server performance; data is shared with business partners.
Users are not required to provide any information to our website, but the site will not work without routing information and essential technical information. If a browser can't or won't provide nonessential technical information, some site features won't work. If certain optional information is not available, some features or services won't be, either.
