OVERVIEW
In order for us to operate our business and provide our services to you, sometimes it is necessary that we collect and process your personal data. In general terms, this data can be divided into three categories:
Information that you provide to us directly. For example, where you complete an online form on our website.
Information that is automatically sent to us by your computer’s internet browser when you visit our website. For example, your computer’s IP address.
Information about how you use our website or our services. For example, which pages you visit, how frequently you visit the site, for how long, etc.
This Privacy Policy sets out the detail of what information we collect, as well as how we use that data and how we protect it.
WHAT DO WE USE YOUR INFORMATION FOR?
Any of the information we collect from you may be used in one of the following ways:
To personalize your experience (your information helps us to better respond to your individual needs)

To improve customer service (your information helps us to more effectively respond to your customer service requests and support needs)

The email address you provide for order processing may be used to send you information and updates pertaining to your order, in addition to receiving occasional company news, updates, related product or service information, etc.
Note: If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails you simply have to click the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any email we send. Then you will be taken through the simple unsubscribe process.
HOW DO YOU GET MY CONSENT?
When you provide us with personal information to complete a transaction, verify your credit card, place an order, we imply that you consent to our collecting it and using it for that specific reason only.
If we ask for your personal information for a secondary reason, like marketing, we will either ask you directly for your expressed consent or provide you with an opportunity to say no.

It is our intention that this policy will protect your personal information from being dealt with in any way that is inconsistent with GDPR privacy laws.
LAWFUL BASIS FOR PROCESSING UNDER THE GDPR:
When you communicate with us or sign up for promotional materials, we process such data on the basis of our legitimate interest, Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR, and our legitimate interest is to provide you with our promotional messages.
Where we are required under applicable local law to obtain your consent for sending you marketing information, the legal basis is your consent, Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR.

TYPES OF PROCESSING:
After you provide us with your personal data, we will store the information you provide to us in our website database, and/or in our self-managed Customer Relationship Management system. All our CRM systems are GDPR compliant. This way we are enabled to efficiently access your data and respond to your requests;
For the purpose of maintaining the integrity of our systems, we may also store this data in system backups
We may use this information to contact youabout other of our own services that we believe may be of genuine interest to you
We will NEVER use this data for any further purpose without you expressing further consent
We will NEVER sell your information to any 3rd party.
INFORMATION THAT IS AUTOMATICALLY SENT TO US BY YOUR COMPUTER’S INTERNET BROWSER
Before GDPR, when you visited our website, our system was saving a record of your visit in our server logs, and this record included the IP address that is associated with your device.
The storage of IP addresses is a common practice and it allowed us to identify patterns of behavior (such as repeated malicious attempts to access a system).
However, from now on, our hosting provider is working on deleting those data or making them completely anonymous. Also, from now on, as we were informed, those data will no longer be available to us, only to our hosting provider for the amount of time they are legally obliged to keep them for debugging and security reasons.
