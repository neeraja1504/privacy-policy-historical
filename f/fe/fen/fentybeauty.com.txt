**XII.       Information on Cookie Management **
This section is dedicated to our policy for managing cookies on the website. It has been designed to provide you with information on the origin and use of browsing data processed when you use our website, together with your rights.
What is a cookie?
When you use our website, we may, depending on your choice, place a text file on your terminal (computer, smart phone or tablet) via the web browser.
This text file is a cookie. Throughout the period of validity or registration, it will enable Kendo to identify your terminal during subsequent visits.
Only the entity issuing the cookies is able to read or modify the information they contain.
Below you will find information about the cookies that may be placed on your terminal when you visit the pages of the website, either by Kendo, or by third parties, together with ways in which you can delete or refuse installation of these cookies.
What is the purpose of the cookies issued on the website?
There are several types of cookies, some of which are issued directly by Kendo and its service providers, while others may be issued by third parties.
I.       Cookies issued by Kendo and its service providers
Different types of cookies may be placed on your terminal while you are browsing on our website:
_(i)      "Essential" cookies  _
These cookies are essential for browsing on our website, especially for the functioning of the order process.
Deletion of these cookies may cause problems with browsing on our website and make it impossible for you to place an order.
These cookies are also necessary for tracking the activity of Kendo.
They may be installed on your terminal by Kendo or by its service providers.
_(ii)      "Analysis and Customization" cookies _
These cookies are not essential to browsing on our website, but may help you, for example, to search more effectively and optimize your purchasing experience and help us better target your requirements, improve our offer and optimize the functioning of our website.
_(iii)      "Advertising" cookies _
Cookies may also be used for advertising purposes. These cookies ensure that the advertisements you see are the most relevant to you.
What is the benefit of seeing special offers and advertising tailored to your browsing preferences?
The aim is to show you the most relevant offers and advertising. As such, cookie technology enables us to display content, in real-time, that is best suited to your fields of interest, as deduced from your browsing history on our website.
The interest you show in content displayed on your terminal when you consult a website often determines the advertising resources of this site, enabling it to provide its services, which are often supplied free of charge to users. You likely prefer to see offers and advertising that are relevant to you, rather than content that is of no interest to you at all. Similarly, both Kendo and advertisers want their offers and advertising to be shown to Internet users that are likely to be interested in them.
Important information if you share your terminal with other users
If your terminal is used by several people or when a single terminal has more than one type of browser software, we cannot be sure that the services and advertising sent to your terminal will match your use of the terminal, rather than that of another user.
In this case, sharing use of your terminal with others and deciding your browser cookie settings are your free choice and your responsibility.
**II.       _Cookies issued by third-party companies  _ **
Kendo participates in behavior-based advertising, and permits third parties to use cookies to collect information about your use of our website so that they can provide advertising about products and services tailored to your interests on our website, or on other websites. The issue and use of cookies by third parties on our website are subject to privacy policies concerning these third parties.
These cookies are not essential to browsing on our website.
On our website, we may include computer applications from third parties that enable you to share our website content with others, inform others that you have been consulting our website or notify them of your opinion concerning content on our site. This particularly concerns use of the "Share" and "Like" buttons featured on social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, etc.
The social network providing these application buttons is likely to identify you via this button, even if you have not used it when browsing our website.
Indeed, this type of application button can enable the social network concerned to track your browsing on our website, simply because your account on the social network in question is enabled on your terminal (a session is open) while you are browsing our website.
We have no control over how social networks collect information regarding your browsing on our website and associated with the personal data they hold.
We encourage you to read the privacy policies of the social networks to learn about the purpose, especially advertising, of any browsing information they may collect via these application buttons. These privacy policies should enable you to exercise your choices with respect to these social networks, in particular by changing your account settings.
Visit the websites of the aforementioned social networks for more information about their privacy policies.
