Extensive disclosure on cookies
Pursuant to Article 13 of Regulation (EU) 679/2016 General Data Protection Regulation (the “ Regulation ”) Fendi S.r.l. , in its capacity as Data Controller (hereinafter: “ FENDI ” or “ Website Manager ”), provides you with the following information concerning the cookies installed on the www.fendi.com website (hereinafter, the Website ).
What are cookies
Cookies are text files sent by a web server (namely, the computer that “hosts” the visited website) to the user’s browser (Internet Explorer, Firefox, Google Chrome, etc.) and stored on the device, either fixed or mobile (computer, smartphone, tablet), used by the user for browsing. Cookies allow the Website to identify the user’s device through the stored information each time the user reconnects itself to the Website through that device.
By using cookies, it is possible to make it easier for the user to browse the Website and to analyse their preferences and tastes by checking their browsing history, and consequently to offer products and provide services more consistent with the interests and expectations of said user.
Cookies may be “session cookies” (when they are stored only for the duration of the browsing session and are cancelled when the session is closed), or “permanent cookies” (that are stored for longer periods, until their expiry or cancellation by the user). Further, cookies may be installed by the website the user is visiting (so-called first party cookies) or may be installed by other websites (so-called third party cookies).
Cookies do not collect direct personal data information concerning the user. In fact, Fendi cannot, by means of cookies, directly obtain any personal data information (e.g. name, surname), unless expressly provided by the client.

Analytical cookies
FENDI, in its capacity as manager of the Website, uses third parties’ analytical cookies to collect information on the Website used by the users (number of visitors, visited pages, permanence on the Website, etc.) to prepare statistical analysis, on an aggregated basis, on the number of users and on how users browse our Website. To use such cookies, criteria for masking the source of the IP address have been adopted.
Such cookies do not require the prior and express consent of the user since they are closely linked to the provision of the service requested by the user of the Website.
