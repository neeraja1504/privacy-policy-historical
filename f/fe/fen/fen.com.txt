FEN and its affiliates may use your personal information to tailor the content programming, services, and applications that we provide to meet your needs and interests. When you conduct a purchase transaction through this Website, you are providing purchase transaction information to FEN's third party service providers (such as transaction processors and financial institutions) who will use the information solely for the purpose of the purchase transaction.
When visitors request pages from FEN sites, our servers log users' IP addresses. We typically do not link IP addresses to any personal information. This means that a visitor's session will be logged, but the visitor remains anonymous to us.
FEN collects IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, sponsors, and partners, and to audit the use of our site. We will use IP addresses to identify a user in the following situations: (a) in response to subpoenas, court orders or legal process, to the extent permitted and as restricted by law; (b) when disclosure is required to maintain the security and integrity of this site, or to protect any user's security or the security of other persons, consistent with applicable laws.
The anonymized information we track with cookies is not used to identify, or lead us back to, any particular visitor. Visitors to this Website may have the option of disabling cookies via their browser preferences (most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies). Cookies make our Website easier for you to use because they save your preferences while you are visiting our sites (although we do not save passwords in cookies). Cookies also help us know which areas are your favorites, which areas need improvement, and what technologies and Internet services our visitors are using. Knowing this information helps us continually improve the online experience for our visitors and members.
FEN may also use third party vendors who supply applications, web hosting and other technologies for this Website that may have access to your personal information and anonymized information but they will never use such information for any other purpose except to provide services in connection with this site.

A Notice About External Links
Occasionally, you will find links from FEN to independently owned, controlled, and/or managed Websites whose content we believe will be of possible interest and value to our visitors. Additionally, you'll see links from advertisers, sponsors, and other partners who may use a FEN owned logo as part of a co-branding agreement.
In many cases, these links represent cooperative projects or mutual links established with the organizations connected with these sites. We do not control the content of these links. These other sites may send you their own cookies, collect data, or solicit personal information. While we identify sponsor and advertiser areas of our Websites, we do not control these cookies or the content of these third parties.
FEN has partnered with other companies to provide certain services. In some cases, you may see a FEN owned logo on another company's site. FEN does not share any of your personally identifiable information with these partners and they do not share any information with us.
Once you leave our servers (you can generally tell where you are by checking the URL in the location bar on your browser), the use of any information collected from you is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you are visiting. That policy may differ from ours. If you cannot find the privacy policy of any of these sites via a link from that site's Home page, you should contact the site directly for more information.
We specifically recommend that children check with their parents, guardians, or teachers before connecting to any new sites.
Security, Purchases and Credit Card Use:
FEN has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. Essentially, we encrypt all transmission of sensitive data and secure all of our repositories of data. When you use your credit card to make a purchase transaction with FEN, your transaction is secure. Our servers use encryption technology to safeguard your personal information and privacy. However, you should understand that "perfect security" cannot be guaranteed.
Analytics Tools We Use
We are committed to ensuring that the Website is valuable and useful to our users. To assist us in this, we have implemented the Google, Inc.'s Google Analytics demographics and interest reporting features on the Website. These tools allow us to review anonymous data regarding the gender, age and interests of Website visitors and collect and analyze certain types of information, including cookies, IP addresses, device and software identifiers, referring and exit URLs, feature use metrics and statistics, usage and purchase history, MAC Address, mobile unique device ID, and other similar information, all to adapt the Website to better reflect our users' needs. Although this information is collected through your Google ad settings, it is not provided to us in a personally-identifiable format. This means we cannot identify what information is about you, and we will not try to figure it out. We use Google's session unification.
The Google Analytics demographics and interest reporting features may collect information on the Website and other online or mobile products and/or services and may combine the information collected with other information Google has independently collected from other websites and/or other online or mobile products and services relating to your activities across their network of websites as well as online and/or mobile products and services. Google collects and uses information under its own privacy policies. Google utilizes the data collected to track and examine the use of this Website, to prepare reports on its activities and share them with other Google services. Google may use the data collected to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network.
The Google Analytics demographics and interest reporting features tool uses "cookies" which are text files placed on your computer, to collect standard internet log information and visitor behavior information in an anonymous form. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the Website (including IP address) is transmitted to Google. This information is then used to evaluate visitors' use of the Website and to compile statistical reports on Website activity.
