Scope & Application
This privacy statement applies to information collected through any websites, mobile apps or online or mobile-enabled technology or digital tools that display or link to this privacy statement (collectively, our “Online Platforms”).  This privacy statement also applies to information shared with us by our approved partners and other third party sources.
This privacy statement does not apply to (i) information collected from you offline or through websites and other online services that do not display or link to this privacy statement, including third party websites to which our online services may link, or (ii) information that would be considered “Protected Health Information” under HIPAA.  FEI Systems’ use and disclosure of patient Protected Health Information is set forth in the Notice of Privacy Practices associated with that particular application or customer specific hosted operation.

We collect and combine information about you, how you engage with our Online Platforms, and the devices you use to view and interact with our Online Platforms for the legitimate purposes described below.  This includes information you provide to us in connection with your use of the Online Platforms and information collected automatically when you view and interact with our Online Platforms.

We collect information you provide directly to us, such as when you create or modify your account or user preferences, sign up for a newsletter, contact us, respond to a survey, use the Online Content, or otherwise communicate with us.  This information may include your name, email address, phone number, postal address, survey responses, user content stored or entered into the forms found in our Online Platforms, and other information you choose to provide through use of our Online Platforms.

Information Collected Automatically
We may also utilize certain third party products or services (“Third Party Tools”), such as Google Analytics, a web analysis service provided by Google, in order to better understand the use of our Online Platforms.  These Third Party Tools may collect information such as how often users visit our Online Platforms, what pages they visit and the websites that referred them to our Online Platforms.  Further, the Third Party Tools may use the data collected to track and examine the use of the Online Platforms, to prepare reports on its activities and share them with other related services.  The Third Party Products may also use the data collected on the Online Platforms to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network.  The Third Party Product’s ability to use and share information it collects about your visits to the Online Platforms is restricted by each of its own privacy policies and terms of use.  Additional information about the Third Party Tools can be provided by contacting us as set forth below.
We may automatically collect additional information about your visit to our Online Platforms, including pages you visit, your geographic location based solely on your IP address unless otherwise approved by you, promotions with which you interacted and other behaviors.  This information is collected for the sole purpose of improving your overall visit to our Online Platforms by providing interest-based content.  For example, we may collect information about your geographic location and a health interest, based on topics you have browsed in our Online Platform, so that we can promote a physician who may practice close to your location.  This data is not shared with any third party.  The data may also be used to provide interest-based content for communications for which you have opted in.
When interacting with our services within social media, we may obtain information stored within social media or authorized by you to be collected by us within such social media.  This information may include your contact information, email address, friend information, friends, and pages with whom you have an association, and other information stored within social media.
We may also gather certain information automatically, including but not limited to, internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), operating system, date/time stamp, mobile location and device type, and/or clickstream data.  This information may be linked to other information we collect about you.  Cookies, web beacons, flash cookies, and similar technologies serve many important functions that help us serve you better.

Sharing of Information
We may share the information described above as set forth in this privacy statement or as otherwise described at the time such information is collected from you.
Information Shared by Us
Affiliates – We may share information with a parent, subsidiary or affiliate entity within the FEI Systems family. Any organization to which we provide such information is required to keep it confidential and to only use such information in accordance with this privacy statement.
Service Providers – In the course of doing business, we employ other companies and individuals to perform a variety of functions on our behalf. For example, we may provide information as necessary to companies that host our Online Platforms or send communications on our behalf.  These service providers may have access to information about you if it is needed to perform their functions for us, but they are not authorized by us to use or disclose such information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or to comply with legal requirements, and they are required to maintain the information in confidence.
Legally Required – We reserve the right to disclose information if required to do so by law or by a regulatory authority. We may also disclose information as part of an investigation or enforcement action relating to improper or illegal conduct in connection with our Online Platforms or other products, including, without limitation, any situations that may potentially involve threats to the safety or privacy of any person or misuse of our Online Platforms.
Sale or Bankruptcy – During the normal course of our business, we may sell or purchase assets. If another entity acquires us or any of our assets, the information described in this privacy statement may be transferred to such entity.  In addition, if any bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding is brought by or against us, such information may be considered an asset of ours and may be sold or transferred to third parties.  Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to try to require that the transferee use such information in a manner that is consistent with this privacy statement.
Aggregated and Non-Identified Data – We may maintain and use aggregate data or other non-identified information (i.e., data that does not identify a specific individual), such as usage statistics, device data, online traffic patterns and user feedback. In addition to using this information for the purposes discussed in this privacy statement, we may disclose such aggregated or non-identified data to third parties without restriction.
Business Partners – FEI Systems may share your information with our business partners. These business partners may use the information received by them to contact you to offer you certain opportunities, products, services, or promotions.  Please note that once your information has been shared with a business partner, it is no longer subject to the control of FEI Systems or subject to this privacy statement.
Security
The security of your information is important to us.  We take precautions to protect your information by implementing safeguards to protect the information we collect.  But you should keep in mind that no website or internet transmission is ever completely secure or error-free.  PLEASE NOTE: The safety and security of your information also depends on you.  We urge you to take steps to keep your personal information safe, such as choosing strong passwords and never sharing your password with anyone else.  If you create or receive a password in connection with online service access, please notify us promptly if you believe your password security has been breached, and remember to log off the online service before you leave your computer or mobile device.
The Online Platforms may offer opportunities to communicate through email.  Because normal email is not encrypted, the possibility exists that unauthorized individuals may intercept email messages.  FEI Systems, its parents and affiliates are not responsible for privacy of email messages except those stored in our system.
Third-party links
Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third party products or services on or linked to our Online Platforms.  These third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies.  We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites.  Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.
COPPA (Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act)
We do not knowingly collect or use any personal information from children (we define “children” as minors younger than 13) on our Online Platforms.  We do not knowingly allow children to communicate with us or use any of our Online Platforms.  If you are a parent and become aware that your child has provided us with information, please contact us using one of the methods specified herein, and we will work with you to address this issue.
California and Delaware “Do Not Track” Disclosures
California and Delaware law require us to indicate whether we honor “Do Not Track” settings in your browser concerning targeted advertising.  At this time, there is no worldwide uniform or consistent industry standard or definition for responding to, processing, or communicating Do Not Track signals.  Thus, like many other websites and online services, we do not currently respond to any Do Not Track browser requests.
California Privacy Rights
Under California law, California residents have the right to request in writing from businesses with whom they have an established business relationship, (a) a list of the categories of personal information, such as name, email and mailing address, and the type of services provided to the customer, that a business has disclosed to third parties (including affiliates that are separate legal entities) during the immediately preceding calendar year for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes and (b) the name and address of all such third parties. To request the above information, please email us at privacy@feisystems.com with a reference to California Disclosure Information.  Please note that we are only required to respond to each customer once per calendar year.
