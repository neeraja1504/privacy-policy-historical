Privacy Policy - FertilityFriend.com
Last Updated May 2018
FertilityFriend.com is committed to respecting your privacy. Since we started offering Trying To Conceive tools on the web in 1998, we have been extremely sensitive to the private nature of this type of information.
Guiding Principle
We do not share your data with any third party except if absolutely necessary to operate the service or because of legal or regulatory requirements.
FertilityFriend.com is fully funded by its VIP service fees and has been so since we started. It does not rely on any type of data trading for any of its funding or any other purpose. In other words, you are not the product. Clear and straightforward, our charting service is what we sell and nothing else.
An immediate consequence of this principle is FertilityFriend.com does not provide advertising, sponsorship, recommendations or product reviews on the service.
Data provided by users
Registration Information: This includes your email address and date of birth. Please note that we do not ask for or store your real name, address or precise location or any other personal identification data. The email address is used as the primary identifier of the account. We generate a random password and ask for a recovery word/phrase. We also store your current timezone to make sure the time sensitive data is tuned to your local time. The password can be changed by the user if desired. The date of birth is used to verify the age requirement (18+) as well as for specific tailoring of the analysis.
Charting Data: The object of the service being the analysis of your charting data, we collect the data you enter and use it to present you with interpretation and analysis as per the service purpose.
Charting Home Page: Users can create a charting home page which they can customize with specific messages. This is optional.
Forum Posts: Users can participate in our private forums and post messages and images. Please note that contrary to most internet forums, posts and images have a limited 90 day life span and are deleted after that time. Posts are not available to search engines and cannot be accessed by non members.
