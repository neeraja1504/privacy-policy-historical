Privacy Policy
We care about your privacy.
At Cirrus Media, we‘re committed to protecting your personal information. That’s why we’ve put together this policy. It explains in simple terms what kind of personal information we collect, how we use it and whether we disclose it to anyone else. And because we take privacy seriously, it’s been designed with careful reference to the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) and related privacy laws.
This policy applies to the Cirrus Media Group Companies, including Cirrus Media Pty Ltd (“Cirrus Media”, “we”, “us”, “our”) and its related bodies corporate.
Collection of personal information
Personal information is information or an opinion about an identified individual or an individual who is reasonably identifiable. We usually collect personal information directly from individuals. However, we may also collect personal information about individuals from various third parties (for more details, see ‘Handling of personal information’ below).
The type of personal information we collect depends upon your relationship with us. When doing business with us, you may need to prove your identity and in some cases, the law requires you to do so. We may also require your contact information so that we can communicate with you directly or deliver products and services to you. So the information we collect for these purposes might include your name, telephone number, email address, business address, employment information and possibly, your driver’s licence or some other form of photo identification.
Less often we might collect personal information about you in connection with a commercial trading account or financing arrangement (such as bank records, credit card statements, credit reporting information), particularly if you’re intending to enter into the arrangement in your own name. We’ll provide you with more detailed information about exactly how this type of information will be used and who it may be disclosed to prior to collection.
At times we may also collect personal information for quality and improvement purposes, such as voice recordings made to our call centre and customer satisfaction surveys.
Whenever it’s appropriate, we’ll offer you the opportunity to interact with us anonymously or by a different name. Commonly this option will be provided to you when making a general enquiry about our products and services or requesting information about a job opportunity.
Handling of personal information
We will do our utmost to ensure that your personal information is only used and/or disclosed for the purpose it was collected, or a related purpose that’s within your reasonable expectations.
From time to time we may need to disclose personal information to, or collect information about individuals from various third parties, including: other companies within the Cirrus Media group of companies
credit providers (disclosed and undisclosed)
information technology providers
data processing and payment providers
financial services and banking providers
consultancy firms and independent contractors
auditors, lawyers and other professional service firms
marketing agencies and other marketing services providers
print/mail/digital/imaging/document management service providers
customer, product, business or strategic research and development organisations
data partners and analytics consultants
publicly available sources of information
other entities, as required or authorised by law
Some of these third parties may be located overseas.
And to help safeguard your privacy, we’ll impose requirements on these entities for handling personal information. We’ll also do our best to inform you at or before the time of collection, about the types of organisations we may be disclosing your personal information to.
In addition to the above, personal information may be provided to other parties where you specifically consent.
Marketing
Every now and again you may be contacted by mail, SMS, telephone, email or online so that we can inform you about new products and services, promotions, offers, newsletters, customer surveys competitions and the like. We may also engage third parties to do this on our behalf. In so far as the law allows us to, we are likely to market to you unless you tell us otherwise. Equally, we’ll always give you the opportunity to “opt-out” of direct marketing communications. If you don’t want to be contacted for marketing purposes, you don’t have to wait to be contacted. Simply advise us in any one of the methods set out below and we will make every effort to meet your request as soon as practicable.
