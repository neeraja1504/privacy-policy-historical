Disclosure to Third Parties

The Supplemental Privacy Policy that applies to the Website will provide you with the email address or contact information that applies to that Website so that you can contact us with a request to change that type of information.

AICPA Supplemental Privacy Policy - Registration
These Additional Terms form a part of our Privacy Policy for this Website and apply to all our Registered Users and/or any other users that provide us with Personal Information. Terms not defined below have the meaning described in our Terms of Use, of which our Privacy Policy is a part.
Giving Us Personal Information; Keeping It Up To Date
When you register or attempt to register on this Website, you understand and agree you are giving us your consent to track your use of our Website, your activities, exchanges of information and transactions in connection with our Website and are giving us the right to use your Personal Information in connection with our Website and as described in our Terms of Use, including our Privacy Policy of which these Additional Terms are a part. You are required to give us current, complete, truthful and accurate information. You also agree to keep the Personal Information you provide us up to date and you will be able to change the information we have in our records at any time either yourself using the procedures described on the Website or by notifying us. Please understand that for security reasons, we may require additional verification or documentation to change certain personal information you have given us (e.g., your name, birth date, email address).
We have the right to terminate your use of any or all our Services and/or reject or delete any entry you make, if we have reason to believe information you provide to us is or may be false, fraudulent or in violation of our Terms of Use. You, not us, are solely responsible and liable for any false, fraudulent, inaccurate, incomplete or out of date information we obtain from you and you will defend and indemnify us as described in the section of our Terms of Use entitled "You Are Indemnifying Us" for any damage or harm that results.
We reserve the right to deny, suspend, terminate and cancel any registration, User ID and the use of any or all of our Services, if we believe there is a question about the identity of the person trying to use our Website. If the burden or expense of providing access to your Personal Information is disproportionate to the risks to your privacy or if the legitimate rights of others would be violated, we may decide not to provide you access to your Personal Information. In such cases, we will provide you with an explanation of why access cannot be provided and a contact person for further inquiries.
How We May Use Your Personal Information
Without limiting any other rights we may have, under our Terms of Use or at law, we may use the information that we obtain from you, including Personal Information: (1) for the specific purpose for which it was submitted (e.g., to receive email communications); (2) to improve our Website, its Content and our ability to provide you with better experiences using our Services; (3) to keep track of the use of our Website and Service for internal research purposes and to monitor compliance with our Terms of Use; (4) to notify you of updates or important information about our Website and Services; (5) to serve advertisements and/or provide you with promotional offers and/or (6) to provide customer service in response to your inquiries.
Opt-Out
If becoming a Registered User on our Website is automatically associated with or allows you to sign up to receive email or other communications from us on a periodic or regular, we will always disclose this to you, your registration or request to receive these includes your consent to receive them and you have the right to opt out of receiving them in the future. Our Website and email communications will provide you with instructions and the procedures you can use to opt out when applicable. You cannot, however, opt out of receiving communications related to the Services you request, in response to your inquiries, or to manage your registration or status as a Registered User.
Deleting Personal Information; Parents' Rights Regarding Children
Other than our employees or operational service providers with a need to know in order to provide the Services on or through our Website, we do not allow direct access to any Personal Information by any person without the Registered User's User ID or appropriate identification.
We strive to comply with the provisions of COPPA (the Childrenâ€™s Online Privacy Protection Act) and do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. Parents of children under 13 have the right to immediately terminate their child's Registered User registration and use of our Services and have the child's Personal Information deleted once the child's age and parent can be verified. To do so, parents should contact us at feedthepig@aicpa.org. Parents will be required to provide verifiable identification that they are the child's parent and if a parent does not have his or her child's User ID, the parent will be required to send an email to feedthepig@aicpa.org that includes the parent's name, address, telephone and email address, in addition to the child's name and email address as shown in our records. We will send a confirming email to the parent at the email address provided by the parent to verify that the parent wishes to terminate the child's registration. The parent must confirm by sending a reply to the return address designated by us. We will then terminate the child's registration and will notify the child by email, identifying the name, address and contact information submitted by the parent who made the request.
