Where we email you to ask you to submit a review in respect of a merchant/retailer’s product or service, that merchant/retailer has given us your name and email address, and asked us to send you such email.
We will not use your name and email address for any other purpose, unless we already hold it in respect of a review (see paragraph 3.2 below). Even where we already hold your name and email address, we will only invite you to submit a review where the merchant/retailer has provided the same name and email address.
