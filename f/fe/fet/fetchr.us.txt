Information You Provide to Us
We collect information you provide directly to us.  For example, we may collect information when you interact with us as a client or prospective or former client, create an account to access certain features of our Services, send us an email, fill out a form, respond to a survey, register for an event, enter a promotional drawing, or otherwise communicate with us.  The types of information we may collect include your name, postal address, email address, phone number, current occupation and business contact information, social security number, employment application information (including education and work history), LinkedIn handle, demographic information, conference/event preferences, payment method information, and any other information you choose to provide. If you decide to sign up for Fetchr using your Facebook account, we will also get basic information from your Facebook profile like your name, gender, profile photo, and Facebook friends.
Information You Create Using Our Services
When you access or use the Services, we automatically collect certain information created by you, including:
Location Information Depending on the Fetchr services that you use and your App settings or device permissions, Fetchr may collect your precise or approximate location information as determined through data such as GPS, IP address, and WiFi. If you label certain locations, such as “Home” and “Work,” we receive that information as well. If you are a driver or delivery partner, Fetchr collects location information when the Fetchr App is running in the foreground (app open and on-screen) or background (app open but not on screen) of your device. Fetchr may collect location information when the Fetchr App is running in the foreground. In certain regions, Fetchr may also collect this information when the Fetchr App is running in the background of your device if this collection is enabled through your App settings or device permissions.
Fetchr App users may use the application without enabling Fetchr to collect their location information. However, this may affect the functionality available on your Fetchr App. For example, if you do not enable Fetchr to collect your location information, you will have to manually enter your pickup address. In addition, location information will be collected from the delivery partner during delivery, even if you have not enabled Fetchr to collect your location information.
Transaction Information We collect transaction details related to your use of our Services, including the type of services you requested or provided, date and time the service was provided, amount charged, distance traveled, and other related transaction details. Additionally, if someone uses your promotion code, we may associate your name with that person.
Address book If you permit the Fetchr App to access the address book on your device, we may collect names and contact information from your address book to facilitate social interactions through our services and for other purposes described in this policy or at the time of consent or collection.
Device Information We may collect information about the devices you use to access our Services, including the hardware models, operating systems and versions, software, file names and versions, preferred languages, unique device identifiers, advertising identifiers, serial numbers, device motion information, mobile network information, push notification tokens, and, if you register with your Facebook account, your Facebook identifier.
Log Information Our servers collect log files when you access our Services, including your browser type and language, access times, pages viewed, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, and the webpage or online service you visited before navigating to our Services. Additionally, we collect information about how you interact with our services, preferences expressed, and settings chosen. In some cases, we do this through the use of cookies, pixel tags, and similar technologies that create and maintain unique identifiers.

Fetchr may combine the information collected from outside sources with other information in its possession.
Third-party sources We may collect information from other sources including, user feedback, such as ratings or compliments, Fetchr business partners through which you create or access your Fetchr account, such as payment providers, social media services, on-demand music services, or apps or websites who use Fetchr’s APIs or whose API Fetchr uses; insurance providers; financial services providers; partner transportation companies;  and, the owner of an Fetchr for Business profile that you use, publicly available sources, and marketing service providers.

Third Party Services The Digital Platform may allow you to connect with other websites, products, or services that we don’t have control over (for example, we may give you the ability to order a food delivery from a restaurant from within the Fetchr App). If you use these services, we will provide the third party with information about you to allow them to provide the service to you (for example, we would give the restaurant your name, phone number and address to drop off the food). We can’t speak to the privacy practices of these third parties, and we encourage you to read their privacy policies before deciding whether to use their services.
