FetchBack - Privacy Policy
TECHNOLOGY
Our Commitment
The following describes the overall company Privacy Policy of FetchBack, Inc (referred to as “FetchBack”, “we”, “us” and “our”). We understand how important it is to keep your personal information confidential, especially online. Our commitment to protecting your privacy is outlined in the policies below. This Privacy Policy was created to inform you what information we collect when you visit FetchBack.com as well as our customer’s (referred to as “Advertisers”) websites; and then how that information is collected and used by companies that display advertisements(referred to as “Partners”). Those who visit our Advertisers’ websites are referred to as “Prospects” throughout this policy. Because our Privacy Policy may be updated periodically, we encourage you to review these pages on a regular basis.
FetchBack is a member of the Network Advertising Initiative. You can learn more about the Network Advertising Initiative, as well as opt-out of FetchBack and other behavioral marketing tools, by visiting http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp
Personal and Non-Personal Information
Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) is data about you that is personally identifiable; like your name, email address, credit card number or any other information that is not otherwise publicly available. The PII that FetchBack collects from you is information you supply to us; such as your name, email address, credit card number and FetchBack.com account login. That information is maintained by FetchBack so that you do not have to enter it each time you visit our website to login to your account.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information (“NPII”) data is collected by FetchBack and FetchBack’s Partners, and is used by FetchBack for the purpose of online Retargeting. NPII data collected by FetchBack for advertising purposes is completely anonymous, and only includes information such as the Prospect’s IP address, date and time of visit, domain type, and their activity on our Advertisers’ and Partners’ websites. None of this information, individually or grouped together, can be traced back to a specific individual.
Cookies
In computer language, a cookie is used to store data on a computer’s hard drive. Almost all websites utilize cookies to one extent or another. FetchBack uses its cookies to provide a service known as Retargeting (details explaining Retargeting found below.) A Prospect receives a cookie from FetchBack and FetchBack’s Partners when they visit FetchBack.com, and / or when they visit one of FetchBack’s Advertiser’s websites. FetchBack has no access to or control over Partner cookies but requires that each Partner only collect NPII information for the use of serving retargeted ads. Any Partner found in violation of this policy will immediately be removed.
FetchBack’s Use of Cookies and NPII
FetchBack’s technology utilizes cookies in the delivery of advertisements to our Advertiser’s Prospects on our Partner’s websites across the internet. This form of marketing is called Retargeting; and it enhances the web surfing experience by showing advertisements to the Prospect that are of interest to them. When a Prospect visits one of FetchBack’s Advertiser’s websites, a FetchBack pixel on that site sets a FetchBack cookie on the hard drive of the Prospect. When that Prospect visits one of FetchBack’s Partners’ websites, our Partner’s website will identify the cookie on the hard drive of the Prospect and recognize that they previously visited our Advertiser’s website. The Prospect will then be shown an advertisement from that Advertiser. In this instance, FetchBack will know that the Prospect first visited our Advertiser’s website, and then our Partner’s website. We will know the Prospect viewed the Ad on our Partner’s website, and whether or not the Prospect clicked on that Ad. This type information is what FetchBack uses in reporting; and in no way can be used to identify who that Prospect is, or any other online activities of the Prospect outside of FetchBack’s Advertisers’ and Partners’ websites.
The NPII data collected by FetchBack in the above outlined process of Retargeting will be kept by FetchBack for a period of five years. After five years, all cookie data and IP addresses are purged. This information is used strictly for reporting purposes and is not tied to personal information. You are able to Opt-Out of FetchBack’s services if you do not want to be a part of future reporting or take part in Retargeting services from FetchBack – please see below for instructions on how to Opt-Out.
