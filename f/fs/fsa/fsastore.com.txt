Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies
We may use cookies, for example, to keep track of your preferences and profile information. Cookies are also used to collect general usage and volume statistical information that does not include personal information.
Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored as text files by your Internet browser on your computer's hard drive. Most Internet browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can set your browser to refuse cookies from Web sites or to remove cookies from your hard drive, but if you do, you may not be able to access or use portions of our Web site.

If you do this, we keep a record of your browsing activity and purchase. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of activities that occur under your usage of the Web site, including products stored in your cart.
We may use another company to place cookies on your computer to collect non-personally identifiable information to compile aggregated statistics for us about visitors to our Web site.
Web beacons
Our Web site's web pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) and are used along with cookies to compile aggregated statistics to analyze how our Web site is used and may be used in some of our emails to let us know which emails and links have been opened by recipients.

We encourage you to carefully read the privacy statement of any Web site you visit, as it may differ substantially from that of this privacy statement. FSA Store makes no representations or warranties nor is FSA Store responsible for the privacy policies of any third party.

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
