This document, the Favro Privacy Policy for Favro, explains to you how we process your personal information when you for example visit our homepage, try our software services and or ask us to help you through support requests. Personal information is information that can be traced back directly or indirectly to and identifies you as an individual such as your name, address, email, physical location, or phone number (“Personal Information”).
We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time and we reserve the right to do so. Any changes we may make to our Privacy Policy in the future will be posted on our website so please revisit it periodically.

2. WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT
Favro AB is the data controller of the information monitored, collected, used, stored or otherwise processed in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
We may collect both Personal Information (as defined above) and Non-Personal Information (that is information, which is not Personal).
Non-Personal Information will be collected, used or stored only on an aggregate basis. This collective data, which is used for internal purposes, helps us improve your online experience and facilitate your use of our services. We do not connect this data to any Personal information collected from you.
If we have collected information, which consists of both Personal and Non-Personal (“Combined Information”), we will treat the Combined Information as Personal Information.
Personal Information will be requested when you engage in the following activities:
• When you subscribe to Favro
When you subscribe to Favro we will collect personal information about you, e.g. your name, title, email and physical location, and typically also your credit card information.

• When you request our help
Personal information may be stored in our internal systems when a request is sent to support and/or requests are sent for training and demos. The information provided during such communication would be name and email address; however additional information could be requested depending on the type of support needed.
• When you send us data to troubleshoot an issue
Sometimes a request to our support results in that we may ask you for a crash dump, a copy of your database or other information that might be sensitive for various reasons and that may include Personal Information. This information may also be submitted to us through a dialog that appears if you encounter a crash. This information will solely be used for troubleshooting and we will delete the information after we are done with the troubleshooting.

If you participate in a survey, contest, promotion, events, communicate with us via social media, post a comment to one of our blog posts or otherwise communicate with us where Personal Information is included we may collect this.
