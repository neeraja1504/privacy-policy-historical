Additionally, if you apply to be a runner, we may collect certain other Personal Information from you as further described in our Runner Software Agreement and/or runner policies and procedures. As a customer user or a runner, it is always your choice whether or not to provide Personal Information. If you choose not to provide requested Personal Information, you may not be able to participate in certain activities or use certain features of the Service or the App.

We may also collect and use technical data and related information, such as information about your device, system and application software, peripherals and other data related to your interactions with the Service (“ Technical Information ”). We automatically collect Technical Information through the use of “cookies” and other similar collection technologies, like pixels, web beacons and local storage.

Your web browser, application platform or device may allow you to opt-out of our collection of Tracking Information by selecting a “do not track” (or similar) setting. However, we do not currently have processes to address those settings or other “do not track” requests, and consequently, cannot guarantee that we will honor such requests.
