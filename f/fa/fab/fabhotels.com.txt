You may request we stop processing and just store the data we hold about you where:
(a) you believe the data is not accurate, for the period it takes for us to verify whether the data is accurate;
(b) we wish to erase the data as the processing we are doing is unlawful but you want us to just store it instead;
(c) we wish to erase the data as it is no longer necessary for our purposes but you require it to be stored for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; or
(d) you have objected to us processing data we hold about you on the basis of our legitimate interest and you wish us to stop processing the data whilst we determine whether there is an overriding interest in us retaining such data.
Objection
At any time you have the right to object to our processing of data about you in order to send you promotions, special offers, marketing messages, including where we build profiles for such purposes and we will stop processing the data for that purpose.
You also have the right to object to our processing of data about you and we will consider your request in other circumstances as detailed below by contacting dpo@fabhotels.com referencing: Data Subject Rights.
You may object where we are processing the data we hold about you (including where the processing is profiling) on the basis of our legitimate interest and you object to such processing.
