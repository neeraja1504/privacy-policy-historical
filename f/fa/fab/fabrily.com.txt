About Teespring / Privacy Policy | Teespring
Welcome to Teespring! Teespring is a global company offering an internet-based service (the “Teespring Service” ) that allows campaign creators ( “sellers” ) to design certain products and promote the sale of those products to consumers ( “buyers” ) around the world through individual campaigns. This Privacy Policy applies to the Teespring Service, operated by Teespring, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Teespring” ), and located at teespring.com (and other regional URLs).
This Privacy Policy describes how Teespring collects and uses the information we obtain when you use the Teespring Service. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your Personal Information and how you can access and manage that information. This Privacy Policy is part of and is governed by our Terms of Service, which you accept in order to transact with us. Your acceptance of this Privacy Policy includes your consent to our use of cookies and other similar technologies as described in this document.
To note, our site may include links to other web sites whose privacy practices may differ from those of Teespring. Because the use of your information is governed by their privacy policies, we encourage you to read each policy carefully. We are not responsible for the policies or practices of any third party website or service.

Information You Provide to Us. “Personal Information” means information that alone or in combination with other information may be used to readily identify, contact, or locate you. The Personal Information we collect will be different depending on your activities on the Teespring Service. For example, to register as a seller on our service, we will collect your name and email address. If you register using a sign-in service or a social media platform such as Facebook, we will collect the information needed to authenticate your account and any other information the platform provides in that process. If you launch a successful campaign, we may collect additional Personal Information as needed to send you and the applicable tax authorities an income tax reporting statement. If you make a purchase through the Teespring Service, we will collect your name, email address, shipping address and payment information such as credit card number and billing address.
We may also collect Personal Information you provide about other people, such as their name and physical address (for example, when we ship a gift at your request). This Personal Information is used for the sole purpose of completing your request.
Automated Technologies. “Site Information” means information received and recorded on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, browser type, the date and time of the use, the pages you visit, the page you came from and go to when leaving the Teespring Service, your operating system and information about your mobile device. We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. In addition, we also automatically collect Site Information when you access or use the Teespring Service. We (and our vendors) collect that information using cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, embedded web links, and similar technologies. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some features or areas of our service may be limited.
We Teespring and our partners use technologies such as cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We also use cookies for our shopping cart, to remember users’ settings (e.g. language preference), for authentication and other similar services. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some features or areas of our service may be limited.
Teespring Tools. “Performance Information” means information we collect through certain tools that we provide to our sellers. Where a seller requests the use of a particular tool (e.g. an advertising analytics tool for use with ad platforms), then Teespring will collect additional data based on the operation of that tool (e.g. advertising conversion information from the applicable ad platform).
Blog. The Teespring Service may offer publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at privacy@teespring.com. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your Personal Information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.
Social Media Widgets. The Teespring Service may include social media features, such as the Facebook like button and share buttons. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the features to function properly. Certain social media features are hosted by the applicable provider (e.g. Facebook). Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing the features.
Single Sign-On. You can log into the Teespring Service using sign-in services such as Facebook Connect or an Open ID provider. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain Personal Information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign up form. Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on the Teespring Service to your profile page to share with others within your network.
In general, we use Personal Information to provide the Teespring Service to you, including, to establish and administer your account, to fulfill your order and send you an order confirmation, to pay you any royalties earned and to respond to customer service requests.
