COOKIES
As part of offering and providing customizable and personalized services, many websites use cookies to store and sometimes track information about you. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive. We use cookies to allow faster and easier access to your account information, monitor traffic on the Website, and measure traffic patterns to improve functionality of the Website. Our web pages may also contain electronic images known as web beacons (sometimes called clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifts) or other advanced technologies that are useful in the provision of services to you, permitting us, for example, to counter users who have visited those pages and for other related Website statistics. We may also use such devices to verify compliance with our terms and conditions of use or with any promotions on the Website.
If you do not want FAO Schwarz to deploy cookies in your browser, you can set your browser to reject cookies or to notify you when a website tries to put a cookie in your browser software. Rejecting cookies may affect your ability to use of some of the services and functionalities at our Website.
WEBSITE TRAFFIC
We may track domain names, IP addresses, browser types, resolution, etc. from people who visit our Website. We use this information to track aggregate traffic patterns throughout the Website. Such information is not correlated with any Personal Information.
As previously stated, FAO Schwarz may also use cookies to track your visit to our Site. While our web servers may automatically log your IP address, this information will not be used to identify you and you remain anonymous.
SOCIAL SHARING FEATURES
The Website may offer social sharing features and other integrated tools (such as the Facebook “Like” button and the Twitter “Follow” button), which let you share actions you take on the Website with other media. The use of such features enables the sharing of information with your friends or the public, depending on the privacy settings you establish with the entity that provides the social sharing feature. You use these social sharing features at your own risk. No security measures, including the privacy settings referenced above, are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot and do not guarantee that the information you share using such features will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. For more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the entities that provide these features.
SECURITY
FAO Schwarz uses commercially reasonable efforts to safeguard the security of your information with physical, electronic, and managerial procedures. Likewise, we urge you to take every precaution to protect your Personal Information when you are on the Internet. Change your passwords often, use a combination of letters and numbers and make sure you use a secure browser. The Website uses industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption on all web pages where Personal Information is required. To make purchases from the Website, you must use an SSL-enabled browser, such as +. This protects the confidentiality of your personal and credit card information while it is transmitted over the Internet. We may update browser requirements from time to time by posting a notice on the Website.
Remember to sign out of your FAO Schwarz account and close your browser window when you have finished your work to ensure that others cannot access your account by using your computer when you are away from it. Because of the global nature of the Internet, when you give us information, that information may be sent electronically to servers outside of the country where you originally entered the information. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Except as discussed above or otherwise designated, the Website does not use security encryption measures. Therefore, information that you disclose by use of the Website (as with any website that is non-secure), by posting a message or using e-mail, potentially could be collected and used by others. This may result in unsolicited messages from third parties or use of such information by third parties for their own purposes, legal or illegal. As a result, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our services, and you do so at your own risk.
THIRD PARTY WEBSITES
The Website may contain links to third party websites and applications of interest, including advertisements and external services that are not affiliated with us. Once you have used these links to leave the Website, any information you provide to these third parties is not covered by this Privacy Policy, and we cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of your information and Personal Information. Before visiting and providing any information to any third party websites, you should inform yourself of the privacy policies and practices (if any) of the third party responsible for that website, and should take those steps necessary to, in your discretion, protect the privacy of your information and Personal Information. We are not responsible for the content, privacy, security practices, or policies of any third parties, including other websites, services, or applications that may be linked to or from the Website.
