Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy applies even if you have purchased via a third party (such as a stockist, trade book holder or professional contractor) where we dispatch your Farrow & Ball goods on their behalf.
Farrow & Ball is committed to protecting your privacy and takes its responsibilities regarding the security of customer information very seriously. This privacy policy explains what personal data we collect about you, how and why we use it, who we disclose it to, and how we protect your privacy.
1. Who is responsible for your data
Our Privacy Policy applies to the personal data that Farrow & Ball collects and uses.
References in this Privacy Policy to “Farrow & Ball”, “we”, “us” or “our” mean Farrow & Ball Limited (a company registered in England and Wales with registration no 00999927 and registered office at 33 Uddens Trading Estate, Wimborne, Dorset, BH21 7NL). We control the ways your personal data are collected and the purposes for which your personal data are used by Farrow & Ball and are the “data controller” for the purposes of the UK Data Protection Act 2018, EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), PCI-DSS, and European data protection legislation.
We also comply with the principles of the US Electronic Communications Privacy Act (18 USC §2510) and the Canadian Privacy Act and Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) although our data is processed and hosted within the legal jurisdiction of England and Wales.
Farrow & Ball Limited is registered on the ICO Data Protection Register; Registration Number Z3256296 – Expr August 2019
2. Purpose and lawful basis for processing your data
We have two purposes for processing your personal data:
• To sell our products to you and carry out any logistics for delivery or return of goods
This purpose allows Farrow & Ball to lawfully process your data for legitimate interests (GDPR 6F) and our legal obligations to your country’s tax and revenue authorities.
• To determine the mix of new and existing customers
As a business backed by private equity investment, we need to monitor our rates of attraction, conversion and retention of customers to provide a measure business performance. Your email address is used to build an anonymised report with no ability for F&B staff or shareholders to determine the individuals included in the statistics. Inclusion in this reporting does not mean you will receive any marketing, inspiration or event communications unless you have given consent separately.
• To inform, inspire and engage with you about our brilliant colours, products and services
This purpose allows Farrow & Ball to seek your consent to process your data for communication, education and marketing purposes (GDPR 1). Without your explicit consent, Farrow & Ball will not process your data for this purpose.
The purpose and lawful basis for processing your data may change from time to time, where this policy will be updated.
3. Consent
Your consent will be an explicit action from 25th May 2018. Because of the need for consent we will not use defaulted opt-in checkboxes or include your personal data for communication and marketing purposes where you have asked only for a transactional email (receipts, proof of delivery etc…).
We will keep your given consent on file for a period of up to 7 years from the last change before checking if your consent is still valid. This is in line with our average customer project cycle. We will not contact you if you have withdrawn consent, but you can grant or withdraw your consent at any time by visiting your contact preference centre at www.farrow-ball.com.
At 7 years we will write to you by email or post, depending on your preferences, with a statement of consent and your current choices. We will then send a reminder email after 30 days if no contact has been received. If this is not responded to then we will take that your granting of consent is still valid.
We will also include the opportunity to unsubscribe or withdraw consent on all marketing emails.

Please be aware that these communications are not made for marketing purposes and as such, you will continue to receive them even if you opt-out from receiving marketing communications.
We will also use your personal data if we contact you after you have sent us a request, filled in a web-form through our website or contacted us on social media.

If you have questions in relation to your personal data, please contact us at: data.protection@farrow-ball.com.
7. Right to be forgotten
You have a right to be forgotten and have data erased and / or stop being processed where the personal data is no longer necessary for the purpose of collection, you withdraw consent, when you object to the processing or to comply with a legal obligation.
We will not erase your records as we need to maintain your transactional data for our legal obligations to the local tax and revenue authorities. What we will undertake is to anonymise your records, overwriting your personal data with fictional names, addresses and emails. Once this has been done it will be impossible to restore a single customer, and a new customer registration will be required.
We have a number of security and governance protections in place that will be excluded from your right to be forgotten:
• Encrypted system backups, held for up to 10 years. It is practically impossible to alter these backup files
• Our anti-spam and email gateway. We maintain email archiving for security reasons, and your info may be kept in this archive. Access to this gateway is limited to named data controllers for Farrow & Ball.

9. Rights related to automated decision making including profiling
You have a right to be excluded from automated decision making. Farrow & Ball have a number of different customer and consumer types who we personalise experiences for. These include home decorators, interior designers, professional painter and decorators, stockist owners and more. Our personalisation of your experience is achieved through automating profiling based on purchase behaviours and information shared.
