How we protect your data
What data breach procedures we have in place
On discovery of personal data breach at the Data Processor’s facilities or a sub-processor’s facilities, the Data Processor shall without undue delay notify the Data Controller.  ****
The Data Processor’s notification to the Data Controller shall, if possible, take place within 72 after the Data Processor has discovered the breach to enable the Data Controller to comply with his obligation, if applicable, to report the breach to the supervisory authority within 72 hours.
According to Clause 9.2., para b, of this Data Processing Agreement, the Data Processor shall – taking into account the nature of the processing and the data available – assist the Data Controller in the reporting of the breach to the supervisory authority.
This may mean that the Data Processor is required to assist in obtaining the information listed below which, pursuant to Article 33, sub-section 3, of the General Data Protection Regulation, shall be stated in the Data Controller’s report to the supervisory authority:
The nature of the personal data breach, including, if possible, the categories and the approximate number of affected data subjects and the categories and the approximate number of affected personal data records
Probable consequences of a personal data breach
Measures which have been taken or are proposed to manage the personal data breach, including, if applicable, measures to limit its possible damage
Transfer of data to third countries or international organisations
The Data Processor shall solely be permitted to process personal data on documented instructions from the Data Controller, including as regards transfer (assignment, disclosure and internal use) of personal data to third countries or international organisations, unless processing is required under EU or Member State law to which the Data Processor is subject; in such a case, the Data Processor shall inform the Data Controller of that legal requirement prior to processing unless that law prohibits such information on important grounds of public interest, cf. Article 28, sub-section 3, para a.
Without the instructions or approval of the Data Controller, the Data Processor therefore cannot – within the framework of this Data Processing Agreement:
disclose personal data to a data controller in a third country or in an international organisation
assign the processing of personal data to a sub-processor in a third country
have the data processed in another of the Data Processor’s divisions which is located in a third country
The Data Controller’s instructions or approval of the transfer of personal data to a third country, if applicable, shall be set out in Fejl! Henvisningskilden blev ikke fundet. to this Data Processing Agreement.
