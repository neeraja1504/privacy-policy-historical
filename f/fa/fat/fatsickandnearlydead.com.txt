We do not control how third parties use Cookies or Web Beacons or how they manage the Non-Personal Information they gather through the use of these technologies on the FSND web site.

Remarketing on Third Party Web Sites
The FSND web site employs Google AdWords Remarketing ("Adwords") to advertise FSND goods and services across the Internet. This is how it works: AdWords uses Cookies to track which parts of the FSND web site you have viewed. Then, using the Non-Personal Information obtained through those Cookies, third party vendors (e.g., Google) display FSND ads specifically tailored to you on third party web sites that you visit. This way, we are able to advertise FSND goods and services in a way that best suits your specific needs.
If you do not wish to participate in AdWords, you can opt out by visiting Google's Ads Preferences Manager. You can also opt out of any third-party vendor's use of Cookies by visiting http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices.

This information from other sources may include age, gender, demographic, location, personal interests, product purchase activity or other information. We may report aggregate information, which is not able to be identified back to an individual user of the FSND web site, to our current or prospective advertisers and other business partners. We do not sell or share any Personal Information with any third parties, except contractors performing services on our behalf who agree not to use this information received from us for any purpose other than performing services on our behalf.
