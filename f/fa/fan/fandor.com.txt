We provide this information so you can make an informed decision about viewing the Content and using the Fandor Services. By viewing any Content or otherwise using the Fandor Services, whether you are a subscriber, or a visitor who has not subscribed to the Fandor Services, you consent to the collection and use of information from or about you as explained in this Policy.
INFORMATION WE COLLECT

We only collect personally identifiable information when you provide it to us. For example, when you register to use the Fandor Services, you give us your full name and email address. To enable your use of certain features of the Fandor Services, we may also collect your birth date, gender, and other information. If you are a paying subscriber, we also collect your billing and credit card information, which includes your billing address. In addition, from time to time, we may collect information that you provide by participating in surveys, promotional offers, or other similar activities.
Account Data Received from Third-Party Services. When you register on the Fandor Site or otherwise connect to the Fandor Services through a third-party service (e.g. Facebook), we may collect your user ID and user name associated with that service, your email address, as well as any information you make public using that service. We may also collect information you have authorized the service to share with us.

When you use the Fandor Services or view Fandor advertising outside of the Fandor Services, we may also collect certain data that does not tell us specifically who you are. It includes things like your Internet Protocol (IP) address, device, browser and software characteristics (such as type and operating system), location, activity on the Fandor Services including title selections and watch history, page views, ad data, referral URLs, network state, device identifiers or other unique identifiers such as advertising identifiers (e.g., "ad-ID" or "IDFA"), and carrier information.
Data Collected Through Cookies, Beacons and Other Similar Technologies
We also collect non-personal information using various technologies, including the following:
Cookies and Local Storage. We may place a "cookie" on your computer, and we may automatically collect certain information through the use of "cookies". A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, sent to your browser from a website's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. We may use cookies to better understand how you interact with the Fandor Services, to gather usage data and web traffic routing on the Fandor Services, and to customize Content and advertising. These uses will help us generally improve the quality of the Fandor Services. We may collect information through other kinds of local storage and HTML5 local storage, including in connection with features such as volume/mute settings for the Video Player. If you would rather not use cookies or local storage, most browsers give you the option to turn them off, or require your approval before using them to keep information. However, if you choose not to keep information in cookies or local storage, certain features on the Fandor Services may not work as intended.
Web Beacons or Pixels. In addition to cookies, we may use other technologies such as web beacons or pixel tags. These are small, invisible graphic images that may be used on the Fandor Site or in emails relating to the Fandor Services to collect certain information and monitor user activity.
Mobile Device Identifiers and Software Development Kits ("SDKs"). We may use or work with third parties who use mobile SDKs to collect information, such as mobile identifiers (e.g., "ad-ID" or "IDFA") and information related to how mobile devices interact with the Fandor Services. An SDK is computer code that app developers can include in their apps to enable ads to be shown, data to be collected and related services and functionality to be implemented. A mobile SDK is in effect the mobile app version of a pixel tag or beacon. We may use this technology, for instance, to analyze how you interact with the Content and advertisements and to enable analytics or other features through mobile devices.

Some browsers have "do not track" features that make it possible for you to signal that you don not want your Internet browsing activity to be tracked.
