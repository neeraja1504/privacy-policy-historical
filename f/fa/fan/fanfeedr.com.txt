A cookie consists of information sent by a web server to a web browser, and stored by the browser. The information is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser.
We use both “session” and “persistent” cookies on the website. We will use the session cookies to keep track of you while you navigate the website. We will use the persistent cookies to recognize registered users when they return to the website.
Session cookies will be deleted from your computer when you close your browser. Persistent cookies will remain upon your computer until their expiry date or until they are deleted.
We use analytics software to analyze the use of this website. The information generated relating to our website is used to create reports about the use of the website.
Most browsers allow you to refuse to accept cookies. (For example, in Internet Explorer you can refuse all cookies by clicking “Tools”, “Internet Options”, “Privacy”, and selecting “Block all cookies” using the sliding selector.) This will, however, have a negative impact upon the usability of many websites, including this one.
