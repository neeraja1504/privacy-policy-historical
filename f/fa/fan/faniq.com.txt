Privacy Policy
Effective Date: August 25, 2011 | Amended April 1, 2013
Allvoices ("Allvoices" or "we") respects and values your privacy. As such, this Privacy Policy details Allvoices' treatment of personally identifiable information ("PII") and other information collected through this website.
Allvoices reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes to the Privacy Policy will be posted on this website and the effective date of the Privacy Policy will be modified to reflect the effective date of the most recent version. If a material change to our information practices occurs in the future, we will only use PII collected from the time of the policy change forward for these new purposes unless we have your consent.
The terms and conditions governing your use of the Allvoices website are contained in a separate Terms of Use agreement available at http://www.allvoices.com/terms. Types of Information We Collect or Maintain About Individuals through This Website Personally Identifiable Information PII is information that allows Allvoices to identify and communicate with you. We have designed the Allvoices website so that you can view the website without providing Allvoices with any PII or having an Allvoices account. This type of user is known as a Visitor.
Certain activities on the Allvoices website, including contribution, report or submission of breaking news; creating a news event; sharing videos, news, URLs, images or perspectives; asking a question; answering a question; commenting; creating a user profile; or sharing website content with a friend via email, SMS or MMS require you to create an account with Allvoices. This type of user is known as a Registered User. To create an account, you must register as a Registered User and Allvoices may collect or maintain the following PII about you:
First and last name; physical address; email address; mobile phone number; gender; age; education; occupation; photographs; personal interests; and any other PII you submit during the course of normal correspondence (including SMS, MMS and email) with Allvoices (collectively "Profile Information").
We may combine this PII with information from other sources. By creating an account and providing Allvoices your mobile phone number, you expressly agree that Allvoices may contact you by SMS (i.e. "text") message or Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS). If you send information to Allvoices via SMS or MMS, Allvoices may respond to you via SMS or MMS.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information
Non-personally identifiable information is information Allvoices collects in the normal course of operating the Allvoices website that does not reveal the specific identity of the individual. We collect certain aggregate and non-personal information when you visit this website. This information does not relate to a single identifiable visitor. When you visit the website to browse, read or download information, we automatically collect standard computer information that your browser sends to every website you visit, such as your IP address, browser type and language, access times and referring website addresses. We generally do not link standard computer information to anything that will allow us to identify users unless to enforce compliance with our rules or terms of service or to protect our service, site, users or others. We also may collect aggregate and non-personal information through "Cookies" or other website technology as explained below.
How We Use PII Collected on the Allvoices Website
Individual PII Collected on the Allvoices Website Allvoices is intended to be a global community for discussion around news, events and people. Accordingly, the Allvoices website publicly displays some Profile Information, including a Registered User's pictures, name, username and location (country and city) to facilitate user interaction on the Allvoices website.
We use Registered User's email addresses to share content and to notify you of important updates to the Privacy Policy or Terms of Use. We do not share with, or display to, other website users a Registered User's email address or mobile phone number. To facilitate searching and finding friends and acquaintances on the Allvoices website, Allvoices allows users to search for other Registered Users based on location (country and city) and interests. Registered Users may email other Registered User's through the Allvoices website without obtaining the recipient's email address. We recognize and highlight our Registered Users (user names) on Registered User Reports and search pages accessed through search terms based on location and key interests/contributions. We may also use a Registered User's email address or mobile phone number to send email, SMS and MMS updates or news, such as an email newsletter, regarding the Allvoices website or other services and products that may be of interest to Registered Users.
We may create anonymous records from PII by excluding information (such as your name) that makes the information personally identifiable to you. We may use this anonymous information to analyze request and usage patterns to improve the website and our services. We reserve the right to use and disclose this anonymous information to third parties for various purposes, including for internal business analysis and to provide aggregate demographic data to our partners.
Registered Users can invite friends to join the Allvoices website by sending invitation emails and by using our automated invitation system. Allvoices stores the email addresses that Registered Users provide so that the respondents may be added to the sender's friends' list. We may also send up to 3 reminders of the invitations (via email only). Allvoices does not sell these email addresses.
Users can also login to the Allvoices website using their Facebook or Twitter username and password through Facebook Connect or Sign in with Twitter or such other services as we may make available for login from time to time. Information provided to Facebook or Twitter will be subject to those entities' respective privacy policies. Once a user logs in with a Facebook or Twitter username and password, certain PII will be shared with Allvoices. We will treat this shared information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Sharing of Individual PII with Third Parties
Allvoices will not sell, rent or lease PII collected on the Allvoices website to third-party marketers. Allvoices, may however, share PII with its affiliates (Allvoices is a subsidiary of PulsePoint) who may use the information for marketing purposes. For more information, please see the PulsePoint Privacy Policy. Our affiliates will not share PII with unaffiliated third parties for their own marketing purposes.
Allvoices may share PII with service providers who assist us with our marketing efforts and other communications, but those service providers will not use this PII for their own marketing purposes and are prohibited by contract from sharing this PII with any party other than Allvoices. These businesses include providers of website applications. These services enable us to deliver communications to website users and to verify and update information about website users.
Allvoices may also share PII in the following limited circumstances: (1) upon receipt of a properly authorized and authenticated governmental request for information; (2) in response to a subpoena or a court order; (3) to comply with relevant laws; (4) in response to an investigation of fraud regarding a specific individual; (5) in an effort to safeguard the person or property of an Allvoices employee or a third party; or (6) when Allvoices believes it is necessary to protect our interests or we believe in good faith that the law requires the sharing of your PII.
Finally, Allvoices may, in the future, decide to sell, merge or otherwise reorganize its business. Allvoices reserves the right to transfer and disclose PII in this circumstance, but data collected by Allvoices will be governed by the same privacy policy that existed prior to any change in business conditions unless you consent to the new privacy policy.
