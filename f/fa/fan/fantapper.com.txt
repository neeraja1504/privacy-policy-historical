When

you
may
be
asked
to
provide,
or
you
may
choose

certain
personally

information
about
yourself
("Personal

Personal
Information
can
include
your
name,
email
address
and
other
information
that
specifically
identifies
you.
For
certain
services,
we
may
also

information,
such
as
postal
address,
phone
number,
and
credit

which
we
maintain
in
encrypted

on
secure

For
certain
Services,
when
you
register
for
a
user
account
with
BAT
to
use
the
Services
(“User
Account”),
including
“following”
or
“liking”
the
Services,
BAT
may
request
that
you
provide
Personal

You
may
also
register
directly
via
the
Services
or
by
logging
into
your
account
with
certain
third
party
Social
Networking
Sites
(“SNS”),
including
but
not
limited
to
Facebook
and
Twitter,
via
the
Services.
If
you
decide
to
create
a
User
Account
by
logging
into
your
SNS
account,
and
depending
on
the
privacy
settings
you
have
set
in
your
SNS
account,
we
will
capture
the
Personal
Information
you
have
provided
to
the
SNS
through
your
SNS
account
(such
as
your
name,
email
address
and
other
information
you
make
publicly
available
via
your
SNS
account)
and
use
that
information
to
create
your
User
Account.
Such
information
obtained
from
your
SNS
account
shall
be
governed
by
such
SNS’
privacy
policy.
You
have
the
ability
to
disable
the

between
the

and
an

you’ve
chosen
to
access
via
the
Services
at
any
time
via
the
“Settings”
section
of
the
Services.
For
example,
our
Services
allow
users
to
create
an
account
and
login
to
the
Services
using
their
Facebook
account
credentials
through
Facebook
Connect.
If
you
are
not
currently
registered
as
a
User
and
you
click
on
“Sign
in
Using
Facebook,”
you
will
be
asked
to
enter
your
Facebook
credentials
and
a
User
Account
is
then
created
for
you.
By
using
Facebook
Connect,
you
are
allowing
BAT
to
access
your
Facebook

and
you
are
agreeing

In

(such
