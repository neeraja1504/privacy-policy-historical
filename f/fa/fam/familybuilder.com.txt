Familybuilder Including Family Tree on Facebook, Newsletters, and Genealogy
We at iFamily Inc., doing business as LiveFamily("LiveFamily," "we", "us" or “our”), are strongly committed to protecting the privacy of personal information of our registered users ("Members"), visitors and unregistered users (collectively "Users" , "you" or “your”) of the LiveFamily.com website (the “Website”) and the Family Tree application (the “Application”) operated by us on a social networking site (“SNS”), such as Facebook.
We have established this Privacy Policy to provide information regarding the collection and use of your personal information, so that you can make an informed decision about your use of the Website and Application. Please note that this Privacy Policy applies only to the Website and Application, and not to the SNS. We ask that you please read and accept the privacy policy of the SNS as well.
Information Collected
Personal Information:
When you use the Website or an Application on a SNS, you allow us to access certain information from your profile from that SNS. The information you allow us to access is affected by the privacy settings you establish at the SNS. For example, LiveFamily may access and store some or all of the following information, as allowed by you, the SNS and your preferences:
your “basic information” you have shared with everyone on the SNS
your profile picture or its URL
your user ID number, which is linked to publically available information such as name and profile photo
the login e-mail you provided to that SNS when you registered
your “family and relationship” information
your “photo and video” information
your “friends” information
Other information indicated as part of the “Request for Permission” prompt from the SNS
Your agreement takes place when you "accept" or "allow" (or similar terms) our Application on a SNS.
Additionally, LiveFamily asks you for certain information in the course of building your family tree and using other Application functionality that you enter separately including relatives' names, emails, places of birth, dates of birth, and other such information. If applicable, when you add a relative who is also on the SNS to the Application, we pull their publically available information and combination of basic information (gender, dob) and extended information (interests, activities) from their SNS profile and we display that information within the relative's profile. For non-SNS relatives, you can input a number of different fields - date of birth, gender, current location, anniversary date - which is used to create the family tree.
You may also provide personal information to include in your profile or your family members’ profiles to tell others about yourself or those in your family tree, or when taking advantage of promotions, responding to surveys, or subscribing to newsletters or other lists.
Anonymous Information:
LiveFamily uses cookies to collect information for record keeping purposes and to make it easier to navigate the Website and Application. Cookies are small text files that are stored on Users' hard drives. Our cookies are not linked to your personal information. LiveFamily uses both "session ID cookies" and "persistent cookies." Session ID cookies are used to store information while a user is logged into the Website or Application and expire when the User closes his or her browser. Persistent cookies are used to make tasks like logging into the Website and Application easier for returning Users by remembering a User's login information. Persistent cookies stay on a User's hard drive from one session to the next. You may choose not to receive cookies from LiveFamily by following instructions in your web browser's "help" file, but this may make certain features of the Website and Application inaccessible to you.
LiveFamily also collects Users' IP addresses and basic log file information (such as address, browser type and language, number of clicks, domain names of web sites visited, pages viewed, the amount of time spent on particular pages, and the date and time) to help locate potential problems with our servers, and to aggregate general user statistics including demographic and geographical information. We use this information to analyze general usage patterns, and to provide advertisements and other services appropriate to the User's location. LiveFamily may aggregate User information in a non-personally identifiable manner to share with advertisers and to enhance the Website or Application with new features.
Advertising
We partner with third party ad networks to either display or manage advertising on our Website or Application. Our ad network partners use cookies, web beacons, javascript, or other tracking technologies to collect non-personal information about your activities on this and other websites and applications to provide you targeted advertising based upon your gender, family status, interests, and other criteria. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking here. Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.
LiveFamily does not provide any personal information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks. This data is only shared in the aggregate. However, please note that if an advertiser asks LiveFamily to show an advertisement to a certain audience or audience segment and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach.
You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks. The LiveFamily.com Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such advertisers.
Use of Information
Personal Information:
In addition to accessing certain information from your SNS profile as noted above, if you submit personal information to us through the Website or Application, then we use this information to operate, maintain, and provide the features and functionality of the Website and Application. You can set the privacy settings on your applications account to control the access of other Users and Members to the information in your family tree and other application-specific information. You can update your privacy settings under the “Settings” link in the Application. Note that Members can forward this information to other Users or non-users.

If you do not want to receive such email messages, you may opt out by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the email, or by changing your applications account settings on the SNS, located here or by contacting us by using the form located here. Opting out will prevent you from receiving promotional email messages regarding updates, improvements, or special offers and advertisements.
If you choose to use our referral service to invite a relative or friend to join our site, we will ask you for your relative’s or friend’s name and email address. We will automatically send your relative or friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. We do not store this email address.
