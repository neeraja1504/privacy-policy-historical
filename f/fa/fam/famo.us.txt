Information storage and protection
Passwords â€“ Each User has an account and password which is controlled by the User. Users may change their password at any time. In order to maintain your password protection, do not give your password to anyone. If you share a computer, you should sign out of your Famo.us account and close the browser window before someone else logs on. This will help protect your information entered on public terminals from disclosure to third parties. If you think that your password has been stolen, please contact Famo.us immediately.

Information Retention. To preserve the integrity of our databases, standard procedure calls for us to retain information submitted by Users for an indefinite length of time. Famo.us understands your submissions as consent to store all your information in one place for this indefinite length of time, if we so wish. If required by law, as is the case to comply with the Childrenâ€™s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), we will nullify User Content by erasing it from our database. We will also respond to written User requests to nullify account information. If you wish to make such a request, which requires that we verify your identity, or if you have any questions regarding this Privacy Policy, contact Famo.us at contact@famo.us or using the Contact Information as provided below.
