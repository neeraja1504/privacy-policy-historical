a range of consumer mobile apps that enable general consumers ("Users") to keep up to date with their favourite celebrities and brands across various Social Media Networks.
2. General
2.1. This Privacy Policy explains how Starcount collects, uses, discloses and processes your personal data. By visiting the Starcount website or applications, authenticating with us or registering with us, or otherwise being provided with the opportunity to view this Privacy Policy, you accept and consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy.
2.2. This Privacy Statement applies to all of the data that we collect through our Services, regardless of the type of Service or the device on which you access the Services.
2.3. From time to time, we may update this Privacy Statement to clarify or amend our privacy policies; if we make a material change to this Privacy Statement, we will notify you either by email or by notice on or through the Services you use. By continuing to use any of our Services, this will be treated as your acceptance of the updated Privacy Statement.
3. Collection
The personal data we collect about you depends on which Starcount Services you use.
3.1. Business Services
3.1.1. If you register for any of our Client Services, we may ask you to provide your name, an email address, a contact telephone number, the company you work for, your address, a username and password and other information relevant to the Services we provide. For specific Starcount Services, the administrator for your Client account may provide this information on your behalf. From time to time, we may also collect other information directly from you.
3.1.2. Depending on which of our Services you register for, we may collect payment information from you to enable us to take payment for the Services you require.
3.1.3. We collect information about you when you use any of our Services. For example, if you are logged in to The Observatory, we will collect information as to how you use it, including: how often you log in, what parts of the portal you visit (and how often), what filters & functions are commonly used.
3.1.4. We collect information about the device you use to use to connect to our Services, including web browser type, device type, operating system, your mobile device identifier, and the name of your ISP or mobile carrier. If permitted by your device, we may also collect your location information.
3.1.5. Based on the information you have provided or made available to us, we may infer other information to allow us to improve our service to you. This may include customising your experience of our Services or to suggest other Starcount Services you may be interested in trying.
3.1.6. As we constantly improve and expand our services, we may require the collection of new information from you. Whenever this occurs, this Privacy Policy will be updated.
3.2. Consumer Services
3.2.1. For certain Starcount Services, you may be asked to authenticate using a Social Login process. Social Login (also known as social sign-in), is a form of single sign-on using existing information from a social networking service (such as Facebook, Twitter or Instagram), to sign into a third party website or application instead of creating a new login account specifically for that website or application.
3.2.2. By authenticating to Starcount Services using Social Login, you consent to Starcount accessing information from the social media network that you authenticated yourself with. This is in accordance with the terms and conditions you will have agreed to when registering with the relevant Social Media Network.
3.2.3. The data we collect (or infer) can include the name or username connected with your Social Media profile, the people you follow or engage with, your profile picture, your interests, your gender, your location, the content you publish, or any other data you make publicly available through your Social Media profile; this information is collected from the Social Media Network, processed and then stored by Starcount.
3.2.4. All of the Social Media data we collect is publicly available and could be sourced by anybody with a computer and access to the internet.
3.2.5. Through the use of our Consumer Services, we may also collect information about the device you use to use to connect to our Services, including web browser type, device type, operating system, your mobile device identifier, and the name of your ISP or mobile carrier. If permitted by your device, we may also collect your location information.
3.2.6. Your consent to our use of your publicly available data from the Social Networks is based on your privacy settings on the Social Networks themselves. If you do not wish for your data to appear on services like ours, we would recommend that you change the privacy settings on your Social Network account (for example, on Twitter, mark your account as "Protected").
