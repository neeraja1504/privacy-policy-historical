FAP Turbo Expert Guide encourages parents to go online with their kids. Here are a few tips to help make a child's online experience safer (you can also check out the FTC's website for more tips on protecting children's privacy online):
Teach kids never to give personal information, unless supervised by a parent or adult guardian (includes name, address, phone, school, etc).
Know the sites your kids are visiting and which sites are appropriate.
Look for website privacy policies (and read them) of those visited by your child so you know how your child's information is treated.
