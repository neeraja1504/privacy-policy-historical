What information we collect and how we use it
**  What we collect** – In general, this Website does not collect personally identifiable information such as your name, address, phone number and e-mail address for ordinary use of the Website with two exceptions.  First, if you provide us with your e-mail address, we will use your email address to send you promotional information regarding Falcon Safety’s products.  Second, if you purchase a product from us (e.g. through shopfalcon.com) or establish a logon with us, we will collect personally identifiable information as is reasonably necessary to provide you with the product, including street address, phone number, e-mail address, name and payment information (e.g. credit card).  We keep credit card information only for so long as we are required to do so to satisfy our legal, auditing and tax obligations.  At any time, you may request that we close your logon or stop retaining information by using the contact information at the end of this Privacy Policy. Falcon Safety will transfer personally identifiable information in connection with a sale of assets of Falcon Safety or a merger involving Falcon Safety.
We also collect anonymous Information.  Anonymous information is collected automatically and includes your computer’s internet protocol address, a mobile device identifier, the type of operating system and general location (e.g. zip code) so that we can understand and monitor the usage of our Website.
To the extent that we use third parties to assist in the operation of the Website, such third parties are required to comply with this Privacy Policy.
Tracking activity on our Websites – We may use your IP address, cookies and tags to track your behavior on our Websites and to make usability improvements.  We also use cookies to maintain user session identity.
Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored by your web browser on your computer’s hard drive. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future.
A unique number called an IP address identifies every computer on the Internet. Each time you connect to the Internet your machine is assigned an IP address. Depending on the Internet service you use, you may have an IP address that is always assigned to your computer or you may have one that is assigned each session (and therefore may differ from session to session). An IP address is a number that identifies each sender or receiver of information that is sent in packets across the Internet.
Tags refer to scripts that are used to track a visitor’s activity on our Websites by web analytics software.  A visitor’s activity is anonymous if he/she is not logged in.  If she/he has logged in using his/her username and password, additional information is passed through these tags.  Tags are used for, but not limited to, determining effectiveness of the Websites design, information architecture, and consumption of information and services provided via the Websites.
Origination Tag or Source Designation refers to a code transmitted to a third party when you click on a link on the Website that transfers you to the third party’s website. The origination tag or source designation allows the third party to identify the fact that you have arrived at the third party’s website from a link on Falcon Safety’s Website.
Information security
Falcon Safety implements commercially reasonable security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. We restrict access to your email address (assuming you provide it) and your order information (assuming you place an order with us) to our business partners who may need to know that information in order to provide you with information regarding a promotion.  These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.
No guarantee
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Accordingly, and despite our efforts, Falcon Safety cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or that we transmit to you.
Linking to other Internet sites
You should be aware that other Internet sites that are linked from the Websites or from a Falcon Safety  e-mail message may contain privacy provisions that differ from the provisions of this Internet Privacy Policy. To ensure your privacy is protected, we recommend that you review the privacy statements of other Internet sites you visit using a link from the Falcon Safety Website.
