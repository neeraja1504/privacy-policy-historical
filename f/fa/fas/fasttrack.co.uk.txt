What we do
Fast Track is a research and events firm that has created a network of private company directors through our league tables published in The Sunday Times.
In order to compile our league tables and arrange our networking dinners, it is necessary for us to collect and store basic personal data on company founders, directors and support staff. The majority of this data, although personal in nature, is publicly available on company websites and at Companies House.
Certain personal data that we collect may be obtained directly through telephone interviews and company visits or at our dinners. We are strongly committed to protecting this personal data and we take all reasonable steps to ensure it is stored securely.
What personal data we need
Fast Track will only collect personal data, which does not include “special categories” of personal data as defined in Article 9 of the GDPR. The personal data that we collect and process can include:
Name, age, job title, shareholding;
Work address, switchboard telephone number;
Work or personal email address, work telephone number; and
For our alumni networking dinners, we also provide a booklet to guests and sponsors with: head-and-shoulders photo, short bio and hobbies, compiled with guests’ help and sent to them in advance for their review.
We use the personal data we collect to:
Research and write accurate profiles of our league table companies, published with The Sunday Times;
Foster relevant and appropriate relationships with the company directors; and
Invite (free-of-charge) directors to our events, enabling them to raise their profile, and utilise networking and business development opportunities.
