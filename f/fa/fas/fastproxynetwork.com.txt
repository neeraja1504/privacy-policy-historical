If you are placing an order, you will be asked to enter your payment information, such as credit card number, billing information and other security questions. Since our payment Gateway is PayPal and Authorize.NET, we do not collect or store this information. You are not obligated to create an account with PayPal unless you choose to do so. In the case of your participation in Ultius Identity Verification, we would collect from you a form of government issued identification and the payment method that you used for processing your order.

Any of the information we collect from you may be used in any or all of the following ways:
To provide access to the services you may have registered for and/or ordered on our website;

How do we protect your information?
We use fair and reasonable electronic, physical, legal and administrative protection, and secure servers in connection with all transactions and regarding all of your private data that is collected by us. All sensitive/credit information supplied to us is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our Payment gateway provider’s database to be accessible only by those authorized persons and/or entities with special access rights to such systems, which persons and/or entities are required to keep such sensitive/credit information confidential. After you conduct a transaction, your private information (credit cards, social security numbers, financials, etc.) will not be stored on our servers. However, for administrative purposes, your name and address are stored in our system and subject to the same privacy protection referred to above. Notwithstanding these efforts to protect your private data, no protection or security system can be 100% effective, and the Company cannot guarantee the security of your private information aside from the stringent efforts mentioned herein. Consequently, the Company disclaims any and all liability for the interception, loss or theft of, or other unauthorized access or harm to your data. By your use of our Website, and/or any of our applications, facilities or services you specifically acknowledge and agree that you understand the foregoing and our Privacy Policy as stated herein, and you fully assume the associated risks and hold the Company harmless in connection therewith.
In the event we request information from you as part of our Ultius Identity Verification (UIV), we store your personal data through an SSL encrypted file storage method and then destroy the data after a period of ninety (90) days. This process is also subject to potential security breaches despite our best efforts to protect all UIV requested data using the latest technology, and thus the Company disclaims any and all liability for the interception, loss or theft of, or other unauthorized access or harm to the UIV data you provide to us. By your participation in our UIV process, you specifically acknowledge and agree that you understand the foregoing and our Privacy and UIV Policies as stated herein, and you fully assume the associated risks and hold the Company harmless from any and all damages or injury for the interception, loss or theft of, or other unauthorized access or harm to your data in connection therewith.
Email Restrictions: Certain email addresses reflect a higher level of risk of intrusion. For example, temporary email accounts registered through institutions such as governments, armed forces, or higher education are provided on an at-will basis and are therefore temporary in nature. Additionally, when you use these email accounts, you submit to unwarranted access at the discretion of your administrator. For that reason, you cannot register an Ultius account using the following email address extensions: (i) .GOV; (ii) .EDU and; (iii) .MIL. Instead, we recommend that you use private email accounts available from a number of consumer vendors: Gmail by Google, Outlook by Microsoft, or Yahoo! Mail.
Dial-in Pin: When you register an Ultius account, we will ask you to create a four (4) digit dial in pin. This is a security code that we will ask you in order to verify your identity and account ownership when speaking to our customer service reps via phone, text, or live chat. You can easily view and change your dial in pin code in your edit profile view.
