Fastway Couriers | Privacy policy
Fastway Couriers understands that privacy of your personal information is important to you. We are legally bound by the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs), in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and are committed to complying with the obligations set out in this Act.
What kinds of personal information does Fastway Couriers collect and hold?
The personal information we will collect from you depends on your relationship with Fastway Couriers. As a customer or supplier it will generally include your name, business and email addresses and contact numbers, and may include your bank account details. Our electronic label printing platform requires customers to enter a consignees address and telephone number to enable Fastway to contact the consignee in the event that a delivery cannot be effected on the first attempt. If you are a franchisee of Fastway Couriers personal information collected may extend beyond this to include your driver's licence number, vehicle registration number, financial details, photo and date of birth. We do not collect personal information that we do not need. Our website does not use persistent cookies.
All customer, supplier and franchisee data is securely stored and in compliance with the Australian Privacy Principles (APP) outlined in the Australian Privacy Act 1988. This data is not used for marketing purposes and will not be shared with third parties.
How is personal information collected and held?
Fastway Couriers collects most personal information directly from you. For example, when you become a customer, supplier or a franchisee you provide us with your information by filling in a form, dealing with us over the telephone, email or face to face, by sending us a letter, or by using our website. This information is held in hard copy and/or electronic databases. We may also collect information about you that is publicly available such as from other websites.
For what purposes does Fastway Couriers collect, hold, use and disclose personal information?
We need to collect personal information so that we can provide our products and services and conduct our business. Specifically, we need to collect personal information to interact with our customers, suppliers and franchisees and often to meet contractual obligations to these parties. Fastway Couriers does not sell, rent or trade your personal information to third parties. However, your personal information may be disclosed to third parties if required by applicable laws, or to service providers who provide services in connection with our products and services. If you would like to opt out of receiving future communication from Fastway Couriers you can do so by contacting the Privacy Officer at the contact details set out below, or by following instructions on the communication to opt out.
