Last Modified: February 8th, 2017
Fashalot makes your shopping experience delightful and rewarding. We at Fashalot helps you discovery Fashion stores near you, their in-store offers, latest collection, and rewards you everytime you walk-in, shop, rate, follow or refer a friend. The rewards are in form of F-Cash. Every F-Cash is equal to Re.1 and can be redeemed for further shopping from F-Cash Partner stores or any free gift. When you use Fashalot you’ll share some information with us. We get that can affect your privacy. So we want to be upfront about the information we collect, how we use it, whom we share it with, and the choices we give you to control, access, and update your information. That’s why we’ve written this Privacy Policy. And it’s why we’ve tried to write it in a way that’s blissfully free of the legalese that often clouds these documents. Of course, if you still have questions about anything in our Privacy Policy, just contact us.
There are three basic categories of information we collect:
Information you choose to give us
Information we get when you use our services
Information we get from third parties
Here’s a little more detail on each of these categories
When you interact with our service, we collect the information that you choose to share with us. For example, Fashalot require you to set up a basic Fashalot account, so we need to collect a few important details about you, such as: your mobile number, your name, your gender with which we can personalize your app experience. To make it even more personalized, you may yourself add a profile pictures of yours on the app. Of course, you’ll also provide us whatever information you send through the service, such as Lookbook Picture for earning F-Cash and get popular, your phonebook access for referring and gifting your contacts, location and notification access. It probably goes without saying, but we’ll say it anyway: When you contact Fashalot Support or communicate with us in any other way, we’ll collect whatever information you volunteer.
When you use our service, we collect information about which of those services you’ve used and how you’ve used them. We might know, for instance, that you just visited a particular location or store. Here’s a fuller explanation of the types of information we collect when you use our services :
