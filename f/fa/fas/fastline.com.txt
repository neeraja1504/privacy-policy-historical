Fastline.com's online registration form requires you to provide your full name, e-mail address, postal code, acres farmed, and password for basic services. Some sections of the site may be accessible after you provide additional information about yourself.
We hope that, like many users, you will want to provide information about yourself so that we can continue to make our website more valuable to you.
How We Use Information
We use the information you provide about yourself only to complete your requested transactions. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete each transaction. With our Equipment Database, we only disclose personal information you submit to the other party after you have confirmed you want to make contact with them. We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not shared with outside parties. Contact information you supply to other dealers through Fastline.com will not be stored by Fastline.com unless you fill out the registration form during the sign-up process. By registering through Fastline.com you’ll be signed up to receive email correspondence. If you do not wish to receive email messages from us, please unsubscribe using the link provided in the email. Individual’s information is not shared with outside parties. We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of users visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number visitors filled out our registration form, but we will not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.
We do not intend to collect individually-identifiable information from, or market our services to, children under 13 years of age. We endeavor to provide a safe online environment for users of all ages. We permit only authorized employees or suppliers, who are trained in the proper handling of customer information, to have access to customer information. Whenever we hire other organizations to provide support services, we require them to conform to our privacy standards and to allow us to audit them for compliance. We will not reveal customer information to any external organization unless we have previously informed the customer in disclosures or agreements, have been authorized by the customer, or are required by law. Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.

Our Commitment To Data Security
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

Our Commitment To Children's Privacy
Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under the age of 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under the age of 13.
How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information
You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain from the My Account section of the website. We use this procedure to better safeguard your information. You can update and correct factual errors in your profile or in your listings by sending us a request.
