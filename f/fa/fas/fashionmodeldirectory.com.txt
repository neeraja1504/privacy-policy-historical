Tracking Technologies & Analytics-
Tracking technologies on the Services may be deployed by FMD and/or by our service providers, advertisers or partners. Certain tracking technologies enable us to assign a unique identifier to you, and relate information about your use of the Services to other information about you, including your User Information. We may match information collected from you through different means or at different times and use such information along with offline and online information obtained from other sources (including from third parties), including, but not limited to, demographic information and updated contact information, for the purposes of learning more about you so we can provide you with relevant content and advertising.
We use Google Analytics to measure and evaluate access to and traffic on the Site, and create user navigation reports for our Site administrators. Google operates independently from us and has its own privacy policy, which we strongly suggest you review. Google may use the information collected through Google Analytics to evaluate Users' and Visitors’ activity on our Site. For more information, see Google Analytics Privacy and Data Sharing.
We take measures to protect the technical information collected by our use of Google Analytics. The data collected will only be used on a need to know basis to resolve technical issues, administer the Site and identify visitor preferences; but in this case, the data will be in non-identifiable form. We do not use any of this information to identify Visitors or Users.
When you receive email messages from us, we may use web beacons, customized links, clear GIFs or similar technologies to determine whether the email has been opened and which links you click in order to provide you with more focused email communications or other information, and/or to aggregate that information with other data we collect to use for some or all of the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy.

Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing Local Storage. To manage Flash Local Shared Objects please click here.
Interest Based Advertising -
The FMD and/or certain third parties may collect information about you for online behavioral advertising (“OBA”) purposes in order for you to receive relevant interest-based advertising on the website. OBA is also referred to as interest-based advertising. It is the collection of data from different sources and across different platforms in order to predict an individual’s preferences or interest and to deliver to that individual, or his/her computer, smart phone or tablet, advertising based on his/her assumed preference or interest inferred from the collection of data pertaining to that individual or others who may have a similar profile or similar interests.
In collaboration with these third parties, we collect information about our visitors and users over time and across different platforms when they use these platforms or interact with them. Individuals may submit information directly on our Sites or on platforms run by third parties, or by interacting with us, our advertisements, or emails they receive from us or from third parties. We may use special tools that are commonly used for this purpose, such as cookies, beacons, pixels, tags, mobile advertising IDs, flash cookies, and similar technologies. We may have access to databases of information collected by our business partners.
We, or the third parties with which we work, use the information collected as described above to understand the various activities and to send you OBA. For example, if you read an article about a particular subject on our site, we may use cookies from a vendor to later serve you an advertisement for a particular product or service related to the viewed article. If we know what ads you are shown, we can try not to show you the same ones repeatedly. These third-party vendors may connect information about pages you visit on the Services with information about pages you visit on other Channels and show you advertising based on this combined information. These advertisements may appear when you are visiting a different section of the website. Likewise, third party vendors may serve you advertisements when you visit the website based on your interaction.
Visitors may opt out of receiving interest-based advertising by advertising networks that may be delivered to them on our platform and other websites. For information about how to opt out of tracking methods for these entities and others, click here. These features will opt a Visitor out of many – but not all - of the interest-based advertising activities in which we or third parties engage. More information can be obtained by visiting the following websites http://www.aboutads.info/consumers; and http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.For more details about OBA and opting out, see Section 14 below.
Online Data is aggregated with the Other Information and data we collect as described in this Privacy Policy and/or similar data collected by partners to create groups of users and certain general-interest categories or segments that we have inferred based on (a) demographic or interest data and GeoIP Data, (b) the pages you view and links you click when viewing an email or using the Services and those of our partners, and/or (c) the search terms you enter when using certain search services. We use this information to get a more accurate picture of audience interests in order to serve ads we believe are more relevant to your interests. We store page views, clicks and search terms used for ad personalization targeting separately from your Personal Information.

We also engage third party providers to assist with the segmentation of this data.
(v) We may also engage third parties for the purpose of recognizing our users and delivering interest-based content and advertisements to them.

However, we cannot guarantee there will not be a breach, and we are not responsible for any breach of security or for the actions of any third parties. Because the internet is an open system, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure.

Any such transmission is at your own risk and you are responsible for ensuring that any Personal Information that you send to us are sent securely.

EU Residents - GDPR provides certain rights for EU residents. You may decline to share certain information with us, in which case we may not be able to provide some of the features and functionality of the Website. These rights include, in accordance with applicable law, the right to object to or request the restriction of processing of your information, and to request access to, rectification, erasure and portability of your own information. Where we process your information on the basis of your consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent (noting that such withdrawal does not affect the lawfulness of any Processing performed prior to the date on which we receive notice of such withdrawal, and does not prevent the Processing of your Personal Information in reliance upon any other available legal bases). Requests should be submitted by contacting us (using the contact instructions in Section 14 below). If you are an EU resident and have any unresolved privacy concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily after contacting us, you have the right to contact the appropriate EU Supervisory Authority and lodge a complaint.
California Residents - In accordance with the California Online Privacy Protection Act, we may collect Personal Information about your online activities when you use the Website. While we give our users many avenues to opt out of providing Personal Information, we do not respond to Web browsers’ “do not track” signals.

Most of these features, when turned on, send a signal or preference to the website or online service that a user visits, indicating that the user does not wish to be tracked. FMD does not act on “do not track” requests from your browser because, there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret Do Not Track signals and this way, we are able to personalize your experiences on our Websites.
Privacy Settings - Although we may allow you to adjust your privacy settings to limit access to certain Personal Data, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures on the Service.
