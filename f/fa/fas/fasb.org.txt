Privacy Policy
Version 1.0 Last updated on December 30, 2009
1. OUR COMMITMENT
The Financial Accounting Foundation (FAF), Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) understand how important the protection of your personal information is to you. We are committed to protecting your privacy. We want to make sure you understand how the personal information you provide to us is being used as well as the choices that you have regarding this information. The following policy discloses our procedures surrounding this commitment.
2. SCOPE OF POLICY
This Privacy Policy governs the privacy practices used by FAF, FASB and GASB on our Websites (referred to herein after as the Sites and listed at the end of this policy) as well as their offline data collection, use, and disclosure activities. The FAF, FASB and GASB maintain high standards for the protection and privacy of users of their Sites as well as for those that have offline interactions with the FAF, FASB and GASB. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully as it states how we may collect, use, and disclose personal information about you. Please also read the Terms and Conditions to the extent posted on individual Sites, or areas of Sites, governing your use thereof.
The Sites may contain links to Websites not under the control of FAF, FASB or GASB and managed by third parties with independent information and privacy practices. We strive to protect your information and suggest you read the privacy policies of the site to which you are redirected before supplying any personal information. In addition, we may have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties. Accordingly, you should consult these other Websites' privacy policies when accessing or using such other Web pages.
Changes to this Privacy Policy:
This Privacy Policy is subject to change to adjust to business needs. Whenever there are changes, the modified Privacy Policy will be posted on the Sites and will be effective at that time. Accordingly, it is recommended that you regularly check the Sites for updates to this Privacy Policy; we will provide a version number and date at the top of the document for your convenience. If the changes to the Site or our accommodations are not amenable to you, discontinuance of use of the Websites is recommended.

Our contractors, consultants, and professional advisers provide a service to us. For example, from time to time we may use third parties to help us collect information about our users.

Those parties' use of your information is subject to their privacy practices and agreement with you.
When it is inherent in the function you use on the Site, such as posting to a discussion area where your email address automatically appears.
Supplementing of Information:
To provide better service to you on the Site, we may conclude it is necessary for us to supplement the information you provide us with information from third-party sources, which would require disclosure of your personally identifiable information to such third parties.

1Users become authorized after entering the correct User Name and Password, and acceptance on our Site by us. We recommend that you do not divulge your Password to anyone. We will never ask you for your Password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email. Also remember to sign out of the Site you are using and close your browser window when you have finished your use of the Site(s).

Access to this premium content may require online registration and enrollment in the program. For many FAF, FASB or GASB Sites, to access restricted content, the registered user must have the appropriate user profile for access to that information. For example, to access the Professional View of the FASB Codification, the registered user profile must indicate that he or she has paid for such subscription.
