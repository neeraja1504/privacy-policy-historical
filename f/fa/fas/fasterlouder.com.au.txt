Where we hold personal information about you, we will try to provide you with suitable means of accessing it (for example, by mailing or emailing it to you).  We may charge you a reasonable fee to cover our administrative and other reasonable costs in providing you the information. We will not charge you for making the request, nor for making any corrections to personal information about you.
Sometimes, we cannot grant access to personal information (for example, if it interferes with the privacy of others or would breach confidentiality).  If that happens, we will send you the written reasons for any refusal.
If we provide you with access to personal information we hold about you, and you believe the information is inaccurate, out of date, incomplete, irrelevant or misleading, you may ask us to amend it.  We will consider if the information requires amendment.  Even if we do not agree that there are grounds for amendment, we will add a note to the personal information stating that you disagree with it.

If you believe that your privacy has been breached, please email a full description of the issue to our Privacy Officer at the details below.  We will treat your requests or complaints confidentially.  Our Privacy Officer will contact you within a reasonable time after receipt of your complaint to discuss your concerns and outline options to resolve them. We take these complaints very seriously and aim to ensure that your complaint is resolved in timely and appropriate manner.
Security
We take reasonable steps to ensure personal information about you is protected from misuse and loss and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.  We may hold personal information in either hard copy or electronic form on our servers and secured third party servers.  We destroy or de-identify personal information when it is no longer needed.
As our websites are linked to the internet, and the internet is inherently insecure, we cannot provide any assurance regarding the secure transmission of information you communicate to us over the internet.  Similarly, we cannot guarantee that information you supply will not be intercepted during its transmission over the internet.  Because of this, any information you send to us online is at your own risk.
