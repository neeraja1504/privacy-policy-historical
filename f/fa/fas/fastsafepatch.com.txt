Every computer connected to the Internet is given a domain name and a set of numbers that serve as that computer's "Internet Protocol" IP address. When a visitor requests a page from any Web site within the our network, our Web servers automatically recognizes that visitor's domain name and IP address. The domain name and IP address reveal nothing personal about you other than the IP address from where you have accessed our site. We use this information to examine our traffic in the aggregate and to investigate misuse of our network, or to cooperate with law enforcement. See also: Will you disclose the information you collect to outside third parties? We do not collect and evaluate this information for specific individuals.
