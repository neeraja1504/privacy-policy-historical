Information Collection
Registration:
In order to become a Fashion Networks user, you must first create an account on this web site. To create an account you are required to provide the following contact information: name, email address, your industry and choose a password. Because Fashion Networks is designed specifically for the soft goods industry, entries from people other than those related to the soft goods industry and those mentioned in the registration page are not recommended.
Profile Information:
Once a user, you may provide additional information in the Profile section describing your skills, professional experiences, and networking objectives. Providing additional information beyond what is required at registration is entirely optional, but enables you to better identify yourself and find new opportunities in the Fashion Networks system.
Information about your Contacts
In order to invite others to connect with you directly in Fashion Networks, you will enter their email addresses. This information will be used by Fashion Networks to send your invitation including a message that you write. The names and email addresses of people that you invite will be used only to send your invitation and reminders.
You may also choose to enter or upload contact data like address , phone number & fax number into your profile of our website. All this information entered there will only be viewable by you and will not be searchable by others in the Fashion Networks network without your permission.
All information that you enter or upload about your contacts will be covered by the same terms of this privacy policy as cover your own personally identifiable information.
Cookies & Log Files:
Like most web sites, Fashion Networks uses cookies and web log files to track site usage. A cookie is a tiny data file which resides on your computer which allows Fashion Networks to recognize you as a user when you return to our site using the same computer and web browser. Unfortunately, if your browser settings do not allow cookies, you will not be able to use our website. Like the information you enter at registration or in your Profile, cookie and log file data is used to customize your experience on the web site.
Due to the communications standards on the Internet, when you visit the Fashion Networks web site we automatically receive the URL of the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave Fashion Networks. We also receive the Internet protocol (IP) address of your computer (or the proxy server you use to access the World Wide Web), your computer operating system and type of web browser you are using, as well as the name of your ISP. This information is used to analyze overall trends to help us improve the Fashion Networks service. The linkage between your IP address and your personally identifiable information is never shared with third-parties without your permission or except when required by law.
Web Beacons:
We will allow other companies, called ad networks, to serve advertisements to Fashion Networks users. Ad networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms. Fashion Networks may “target” some ads to users that fit a certain general profile — for example, “product managers in Texas.” Fashion Networks does NOT use personally identifiable information to target ads.
To deliver these ads properly, Fashion Networks may include a file, called a web beacon, from these ad networks within pages served by Fashion Networks so the networks may provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for advertisers as well as to target ads to you while you visit other websites.
Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network’s servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.
These general targets may also be used by ad networks to display targeted ads on other websites as a substitute for random, irrelevant ads. You will never see additional ads as a result of being a Fashion Networks user and Fashion Networks never provides personally identifiable information to any advertiser nor any third party.
