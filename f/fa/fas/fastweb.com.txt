1. COLLECTION OF INFORMATION
Information is collected from our users at several different points during your visit to Fastweb.
Registration --A user must register in order to use this site. During registration, a user is required to provide certain categories of information, such as name, address, e-mail address, a password, date of birth, gender, and country of citizenship. In addition, a user may choose to provide other categories of information, such as career objectives, health or disability information, hobbies, and other interests. Fastweb encourages its users to provide all of these fields of information so that users may maximize the effectiveness of the scholarship, college and job search and matching services which they select.
Optional Information --At various other points during your visit to Fastweb, you may be asked to provide information about yourself. For example, you may wish to participate in a survey or a contest. Participation in surveys or contests or the use of other services which require the input of additional information is completely voluntary on your part, and you have the choice about whether to disclose the information necessary to use these features of our site.
Passive Collection of Information --In addition to the information which you actively provide to Fastweb by methods such as completing the registration form, Fastweb collects information about how you interact with our site. Fastweb collects passive information for purposes such as testing and improving a user's experience at the site and the compilation of broad aggregate demographic data and related usage information for internal purposes and for disclosure to third parties such as advertisers and content partners. The types of passive information collected by this site include, without limitation, your IP address, which type of browser you are using, where you go on our site, and how long you stay on any part of our site. Passive information does not identify you to Fastweb by name, and Fastweb does not link your IP address to your personally identifiable information.
Collection of Information from Children --Fastweb abides by federal law and the guidelines set up by the Federal Trade Commission regarding youth privacy. As such, Fastweb will not knowingly collect any personal information from or allow the registration of young people under the age of 13.
Use of Cookies --Fastweb uses "cookies" to help maximize your online experience and enhance your safety online. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard drive by a Web page server. Cookies are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to your computer, and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
Fastweb uses both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file.
Fastweb uses session cookies to monitor your interaction with the site. After you have been idle for a certain period of time, the Fastweb server will log you out to protect the security of your account. The session cookie expires when you close your browser. Fastweb also uses permanent cookies to track click streams. Fastweb does not link cookie data to personally identifiable information.
Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies. The Fastweb privacy policy covers the use of cookies by Fastweb only and does not cover the use of cookies by any business partners.
You may have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline all cookies if you prefer. Alternatively, you may be able to modify your browser setting to notify you each time a cookie is tendered and permit you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis. If you choose to decline cookies, however, that may hinder performance and negatively impact your experience on Fastweb.
Use of Web Beacons --Fastweb pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) that allow us to count users who have visited those pages. Web beacons are not used to access your personally identifiable information; they are a technique we use to compile aggregated statistics about usage of the Fastweb site. Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the Web beacon resides.
You may not decline web beacons, however, they can be rendered ineffective by declining all cookies or modifying your browser setting to notify you each time a cookie is tendered and permit you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis.
2. USE OF INFORMATION
The information which you supply to Fastweb enables us to provide the scholarship, college and job search and matching services which you select by matching your background to our database of scholarship, college and job listings. We use data about you and your use of our services to display customized advertising, both on our site and on other sites with which we have a business relationship. In addition, Fastweb uses your information in order to customize our site to your interests and enhance your overall experience at our site. Fastweb tries to recognize you using various methods, including having you log in with your e-mail address and your password. Once Fastweb recognizes you, pages, advertisements and other content is customized for you so that you can see what interests you the most. In addition, as described above, Fastweb utilizes passive information to learn more about how you interact with our site. This passive information may be combined with your other information for purposes such as testing and improving your experience at our site and the compilation of broad aggregate demographic data and related usage information for internal purposes and for disclosure to third parties such as advertisers and content partners in order to serve customized advertisements to you on our Sites or sites with which we have a business relationship. This aggregate passive information does not contain any personal information which can identify any individual user.
Contacting You by E-Mail --Fastweb may use your contact information periodically in order to send you e-mail regarding updates at the Fastweb site, such as new Fastweb opportunities and additional listings which may be of interest to you. The frequency of these messages will vary depending upon your profile, including the types of scholarships and other activities you have indicated an interest in. In addition, we may send you free informational newsletters or notices relating to topics which may be of special interest to you, including financial aid, admissions tips, job opportunities and job advice. Finally, if you specifically provide Fastweb with permission at the time of registration, you may also receive commercial e-mails. Out of respect for the privacy of our users, we present the option to opt-out of receiving newsletters and/or commercial e-mails whenever such messages are sent by Fastweb, as described below in section 4, “Opt out information.” E-mail messages from third parties are not governed by the opt-out provisions of this Privacy Policy, but all such third parties are strongly encouraged to include opt-out procedures in their messages to you.
3. SHARING OF INFORMATION
Fastweb will not knowingly sell, share, rent or otherwise transfer your information other than in accordance with the terms set forth in this Privacy Policy.
During the registration process, and at certain points thereafter in connection with specific offers, Fastweb asks you whether information about you may be sent to third parties who have products, services and opportunities which may be useful to you. Fastweb understands how important your information is to you. Therefore, Fastweb does not share any information that can be tied to you without your permission. If you give your permission to allow third parties to contact you, personal information about you (such as your contact information and other information collected during your visit to Fastweb) may be shared with colleges, universities, potential employers, recruiters/headhunters, data aggregators, marketers (possibly in the form of list rental), and other organizations. Regardless of your decision regarding the sharing of your personal information, we may share broad aggregate demographic data and related usage information with our business partners. This aggregate information does not contain any personal information which can identify any individual user.
Third-Party Service Providers --From time to time, Fastweb may decide that it is more efficient to use third parties to perform specific services, such as sending newsletters to Fastweb's users. If we use a third party to provide specific services (such as sending newsletters to our users on our behalf), then information (such as contact information) may be shared with that party to the extent necessary for the third party to provide these services. These third-party service providers are only allowed to use personally identifiable information for the purpose of providing the specific services requested by Fastweb. The third-party services covered by this paragraph do not include links to third-party sites found on our site, which are governed by a more specific provision (Links to Other Sites) below.
Disclosure to Law Enforcement and Similar Disclosures --While Fastweb strives to protect the personal information of our users, Fastweb discloses information if legally required to do so, if requested to do so by a governmental entity, or if it believes in good faith that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process; (b) protect our rights or property or our affiliated companies; (c) prevent a crime or protect national security; or (d) protect the personal safety of users or the public.
