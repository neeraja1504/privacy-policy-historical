Disclosure and sharing
Our responsibilities
We do not rent, sell, trade, or share your personal information with third parties for their marketing purposes without your consent.
We may share your personal information with the following trusted persons or companies:
Authorized persons within the organization to facilitate our work including communication, planning, and donation processing.

Your responsibilities
We may invite you to submit an article for publication. If you choose to do so, you are responsible for exercising care when sharing any personal data.
Information you share in published articles is public and thus is not protected by our privacy policy nor are we liable if you choose to disclose your personal information in your article. Anything published on our website may be available worldwide. We cannot prevent the use or misuse of such information by others.
Storage and retention
All electronic information is stored on computers and servers located in the United States and/or Canada.
We retain information we collect from you for as long as needed for business or legal purposes or until you ask us to delete it. Your information may be retained in electronic form, paper form, or a combination of both.
When your information is no longer needed, or you ask us to remove it, we will destroy, delete, or erase it within ten business days. The data may remain in backups on our servers for up to 30 days, after which it will be completely removed. We reserve the right to to retain certain information for recordkeeping purposes and/or to complete any transactions that you began prior to requesting removal.
Security
We use physical, technical, and organizational safeguards in an effort to secure the information we collect. These safeguards vary based on the sensitivity of the information.
Passwords are stored using secure password hashes, not in plain text. Therefore, we cannot look up your password if you forget it; you must request a new password or a password reset.
We do not collect, process, or save credit card information on our website or website server. We use third-party payment processing services that use industry-standard encryption technology to protect your credit card information from unauthorized use. Please see their privacy policy (GiveDirect) for more information. We do not store or retain financial information you provide to us by other means (such as in print or by phone) after processing is complete unless needed for recurring processing.
Unfortunately, no security system, method of transmission, or electronic storage is impenetrable. While we use reasonable security measures to protect your information, we cannot guarantee against the loss or misuse of your personal information in the event it is intercepted, accessed, or disclosed in a manner beyond our control. We are not responsible for the circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures used on our website or in our offices.
Most email and mobile transmissions are not encrypted, so you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us via email, text messages, or other mobile transmissions.
We strongly urge you to protect your your password and to not share it with anyone. If you log in to our website, always log out when you finish using it, especially if you are sharing a computer or using a computer in a public place.
