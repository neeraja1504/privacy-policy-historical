Security and Intrusion Detection
For security purposes and to make sure this service remains available to all users, we use special software programs for monitoring network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise to cause damage to this government computer system. These programs collect no personally identifiable information, but they do collect information that could help us identify someone attempting to tamper with this Web site.
Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, we make no other attempts to identify individual users or their usage habits. We only use raw monitoring data logs for determining trends in usage patterns and in diagnosing system problems.

Information from e-mail you send us
If you decide to send us an electronic mail message (e-mail, which includes information you send to Customer Service regarding a problem or feedback you provide on a Customer Survey), the message will usually contain your return e-mail address. If you include personally identifying information in your e-mail because you want us to address issues specific to your situation, we may use that information in contacting other federal agencies or our partners (such as schools, lenders, or state agencies) in connection with your student aid application or aid awards. In other limited circumstances, including requests from Congress or other parties, we may be required by law to disclose information that you submit.
Also, e-mail is not necessarily secure against interception. If your communication is very sensitive, or includes personal information such as data from your tax return or student loan account, you may prefer to mail it by postal mail to:
Federal Student Aid Information Center
P.O. Box 84

Information collected if you complete a form on our Web sites
On this Web site, we offer interactive forms that allow you to apply for financial aid. When you apply for federal student aid using one of these forms, the Office of Federal Student Aid is authorized to maintain a record of the transactions related to your application.
Under the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended we are allowed to ask for the information on this form so that we can determine whether you are eligible for aid, and, if so, how much. We will share the information with other agencies, such as the Social Security Administration, to verify the information you put on the application. If you do not give us all of the information we need to process your FAFSA, your aid may be delayed or denied. For a complete description of the information we must tell you under the Privacy Act (Your Privacy Act Rights), click the Privacy Act link below.

Your rights under the Paperwork Reduction Act
According to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, no persons are required to respond to a collection of information unless such collection displays a valid OMB control number. The valid OMB control number for this information collection is 1845-0001.

The obligation to respond to this collection is voluntary. If you have comments or concerns regarding the status of your individual submission of this form, please contact the Federal Student Aid Information Center, P.O. Box 84, Washington, D.C. 20044 directly.
