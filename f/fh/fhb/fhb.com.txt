Privacy - First Hawaiian Bank
To protect your personal information online, First Hawaiian goes to great lengths to see that your transactions are confidential and secure.
When you visit First Hawaiian's Website (www.fhb.com) and apply for First Hawaiian products, or enroll in online banking at FHB Online, the personal information you provide to us is encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. SSL provides secure communications over the Internet by verifying that the server to which you are connected is the one it claims to be. It also encrypts -- or scrambles -- all transactions between the parties communicating so it's virtually impossible for anyone else to read it.
Also, when you visit our Website, our Web server automatically recognizes only:
Your Internet Service Provider (for example, Oceanic Time Warner Cable or Hawaiian Telcom), but not your specific e-mail address. For instance, if your e-mail address is johndoe@hawaii.net, only the hawaii.net part of the address is recognized.
Aggregate information on which pages consumers visit, but no information on pages visited by any individual identifiable consumer. The aggregate information we collect (for instance, how many "hits" on a particular Web page) is used for internal review to improve the content of our Web site, and is then discarded.
Information That You Voluntarily Provide to Us
Here's what we do with information that you voluntarily provide to us, such as survey information or information requests:
E-Mail Address. If you supply us with your e-mail address online when requesting information about a specific product or service, you will only receive the information that you requested when you provided us your e-mail address.
FHB Online® Personal Information. If you enroll in our FHB Online service and supply us with personal data (such as e-mail address or birth date), we may use this data to provide you with personalized information on products, services or special promotions we feel will be of interest to you. However, if you wish to be excluded from receiving such information by e-mail, we'll give you an opportunity to tell us this online. We will respect your wishes not to receive such e-mail.
Postal Mail Address. If you supply us with your postal address online, you will only receive the information for which you provided us your address.
Telephone Number. If you supply us with your telephone number online, you may receive telephone contact from us with information regarding inquiries you have made online.
Financial Planning Tools. We have built into fhb.com many planning tools to help you make financial decisions in the privacy of your home. When you use these tools to construct "what-if?" scenarios about mortgages, car loans, etc., we do not capture the personal information you provide on these planning tools.
FHB Online®. When you bank online with First Hawaiian, we, along with the outside companies we work with to bring this service to you, have access to your information. Information is retained on our system or the system of the appropriate outside company to serve you.
Security
To protect your personal information, we use state-of-the-art Internet technology. We also require that you furnish a User Name and Password to access your accounts. You can help maintain the security of your banking information by not sharing your User Name or Password with anyone, by changing your Password regularly, and by remembering to sign off.
Internal Security. Security procedures within FHB Online include stringent systems to protect internal account information from outside access and make the structure of the bank's internal networks invisible to outside observers.
Remember to Log-off. Leaving your computer with your FHB Online account information open, even for a few moments, can be dangerous. Before you leave your computer, please remember to log out of FHB Online by clicking the "log out" button. This ends your session and ensures that the next time you or anyone else tries to enter your account, they have to know your User Name and Password.
Cookies
About "cookies." A cookie is a file sent from a website to a computer that is logged onto the site. Cookies are commonly used on websites and do not harm your system. To provide better service and a more effective website, we use "cookies" as part of our interaction with your browser. These cookies do not collect personally identifiable information, and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personal information to determine who you are or your e-mail address. These cookies record information about your visit to our Website, such as whether your computer has visited our Website before, what security requirements and browser preferences your computer requires, the date and time when you visit our Website, and how you reached our Website.
Cookies and Advertising on Third Party Websites. When you visit certain pages on our Website, a special type of cookie is sent from our Website to your computer. As with other cookies that we use, this cookie does not collect personally identifiable information. This cookie records information about your visit to our Website, such as the date and time when you visited our Website and which portions of our Website you visited. When you visit third party websites that are part of a certain advertising network, this cookie will be accessed by the third party website, and a First Hawaiian advertisement will appear on the third party website. Because this cookie does not include any of your personally identifiable information, neither the third party website nor the advertising network will receive any of your personally identifiable information from this cookie.
If you do not want to receive advertisements, including First Hawaiian advertisements, on third party websites through the cookie-based process described in the prior paragraph, you can opt out by going to http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ and following the instructions to opt out of all companies shown.
Information about Online Tracking
Some browsers incorporate a Do Not Track feature that signals to websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked.  Tracking is not the same as using or collecting information in connection with a single website.  For these purposes, tracking refers to collecting personally identifiable information from consumers who use or visit a website or online service as they move across different websites over time.
How browsers communicate the Do Not Track signal is not yet uniform.  As a result, our Website is not yet set up to interpret or respond to Do Not Track signals communicated by your browser.  Even so, as described more fully throughout this Internet Privacy Policy, we limit our collection and use of your personal information.
For a description of Do Not Track protocols for browsers and mobile devices, or simply to learn more about the choices available to you, you can visit the All About Do Not Track website: http://allaboutdnt.com.
Children
Protecting Your Children. We do not knowingly solicit data from children under 13, and we do not market online products or services to children. We recognize that protecting children's identities and privacy online is important and that the responsibility to do so rests with both the online industry and with parents.
