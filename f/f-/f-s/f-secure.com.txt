Website privacy policy | F-Secure
In brief
We use cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies to learn how our websites are used and how they perform.
We do this to improve your experience on the sites, and to be better able to market our products and services to you.
The specific set of technologies used varies depending on the product, service, and site you are interested in or use.
In full
This policy describes the privacy practices on our websites. By "websites" (or "sites") this description refers to groups of pages within the f-secure.com domain. Our online resellers (e.g. Cleverbridge AG) have their own privacy policies and are not included in this policy. For our personal data processing practices in general, please see the F‑Secure privacy statement. If you are looking for information about how we process your data in a particular service, you may also find our service-specific privacy policies, e.g. that of F‑Secure SAFE, relevant to you.
We use cookies on our websites to assist us in content personalization, website improvements and development, and to create relevant online marketing activities. When you visit our sites, you agree to the use of such cookies. If you do not want us to place cookies on your device, we recommend that you update your browser settings accordingly, use private browsing when visiting our site, or make use of tracking protection tools.
Some cookies are required for proper functioning of the site or for security reasons, and are always set. For the sake of keeping this document relevant, such essential cookies are not discussed herein.
Website personalization and development
The information collected via cookies and other web technologies helps us understand when and how visitors discover, interact with, and leave our websites. We then use this information to
improve the visibility and usability of our sites,
locate and address technical issues you might experience,
deliver customized and relevant content, including pricing, to you, and
direct you to the most relevant localized web page (based on geographic IP address).
By default, we do not use cookies to identify the individuals who visit our websites. However, if you have voluntarily submitted your contact information to F‑Secure — when purchasing a product, downloading a product trial, completing a survey or entering a contest, for example — we may, with your consent, tie your website usage to your individual record through the use of cookies. If you are a visitor interested in our corporate-oriented communication, this will also include your previous browsing on F‑Secure websites. If you already have a business relationship with F‑Secure, this will be combined with the pre-existing information we have about you stored in our Customer Relations Management platform. Read more.
We generate statistics and aggregate reports for internal use, as well as for sharing with F Secure group companies, partners, and subcontractors. Our third-party web analytic providers may also create and publish aggregate reports of the data collected. The statistics and aggregate reports do not contain any data that could be linked to an individual website visitor.
Web marketing activities
The data we collect can also be used for marketing purposes. Information about the pages you have visited or the products you bought in the past helps us market more relevant services to you in the future.
We also work with data aggregators and ecommerce sites to provide targeted advertising to our customers. In practice, this means that when you visit our site or a third-party website we have partnered with, or click an advertisement for F‑Secure products or services, your activity may be tracked through cookies. These cookies are generated by our marketing partners and used to display personalized F‑Secure-related advertisements on other websites.
We do not sell your personal data to third-party advertisers. Information that is not personally identifiable may be shared with our advertising or business partners. They may also use cookies to track what advertisements you have seen and what products or services you appear to be interested in.
General information about cookies
Cookies help us collect information about the use of our website. This information includes, among other things,
the web browsers and operating systems used,
the domains of referring sites (traffic origin),
the date, time, number, and duration of visits,
which pages or elements within pages were viewed,
which links, buttons, or other items were clicked,
and what was typed into text fields in forms.
Cookies may contain IDs, typically random strings of numbers and letters, that are unique to your browser. This helps us recognize your browser when you visit our website again.
We use both first-party (set by F‑Secure) and third-party cookies (set by a vendor other than F‑Secure). Third-party cookies convey information to that third-party site upon your visit to an F‑Secure site.
Cookies are also used to track your reaction to emails sent to you, so that we know whether we have been successful in relaying the messaging to you.
Opting out
You can discontinue cookie-based data collection at any time, by adjusting your browser settings or opting out on third-party provider pages (see the table below). Do note that some features of our website rely on cookies to function. There are many sites, such as aboutcookies.org, that give advice related to cookie settings and how to change them.
We use the following service providers to achieve some of the collection of data via cookies, as described above. If you do not wish to disable tracking cookies entirely (from your browser settings), you can follow the links below to opt out from individual third-party providers.

Third-party websites
We are not responsible for any third-party websites you enter via our website, and their practices are not covered by this policy. Our personal data policy does not cover data collected by any third-party websites, so you should read the privacy statements of those websites carefully.
F‑Secure does not control cookies from third-party websites. The third parties are responsible for how these cookies work and how the personal data is processed.
The practices related to accepting or blocking third-party cookies vary by marketing campaign and are defined by the third party and applicable laws.
