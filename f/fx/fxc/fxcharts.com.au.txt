What kind of Information do we collect?
We collect a limited amount of information about our members, so that we can provide a site that is more interesting and useful, as well as provide advertising that is more appropriate for our readers. We ask for your name and email address only, when you register on FX Charts or if you sign up for any of the paid services.

No. FX Charts shares your concern about the protection of your personal information online. FX Charts will disclose your personal information only to the extent necessary to fulfill any orders of paid services in order to charge your credit card. At this stage we are not offering any payable services or products.

FX Charts uses information obtained from its users to enhance users’ experiences on our sites. Tracking information is used to create aggregate reports on user demographics and site traffic patterns and then provided to our advertisers and partners, enabling them to better target their advertisements to our users. None of the information provided to them can be connected to the identities or other personal information of individual users.
Security Disclaimer:
FX Charts uses reasonable security methods to protect the data that resides on our servers. However, no security system is impenetrable.
