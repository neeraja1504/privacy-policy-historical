CARD PROCESSING
Card processing is provided by GSL Genius Services Limited with offices at Makariou & Agias Elenis
36, Galaxias Building, 5th Floor, Office 502, 1061, Nicosia, Cyprus.
REFUNDS AND WITHDRAWALS
We reserve the right to impose withdrawal limits and withdrawal fees in our systems, at any time.
Upon submitting a withdrawal request you may be required to submit documentation as required by
applicable “Anti-Money Laundering (“AML”) & Know Your Customer (“KYC”) Legislation” and/or any
other similar rules and regulations applicable to us.
When a withdrawal or refund is performed, we reserve the right (but shall under no circumstances
be obliged) to remit the funds to the same remitter from, and by the same payment method through
which such funds were initially received by us. In that connection, we reserve the right, at our sole
discretion, (a) to decline withdrawals via certain specific payment methods; (b) to require another
payment method as the one indicated in any withdrawal request, in which instance a new withdrawal
request may have to be submitted; and/or (c) to require that further documentation be submitted, as
required by applicable “Anti-Money Laundering (“AML”) & Know Your Customer (“KYC”) Legislation”
and/or any other similar rules and regulations applicable to us, before proceeding with any withdrawal
request.
If we are unable to remit the funds, or any partial amount thereof, to the same remitter from, and by
the same payment method through which such funds were initially received by us, we reserve the
right (but shall under no circumstances be obliged) to transmit the funds via an alternative payment
method selected by us, at our sole discretion, in any currency we deem fit (regardless of the currency
in which the initial deposit was made). Under these circumstances, we shall not be responsible for
any transfer fees or charges charged by the receiver and/or for any currency exchange rates resulting
from the payment of such amount.
Withdrawal requests that are accepted and approved by us in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement are, in principle, processed within one Business Days following the receipt of the transfer
request instructions. The amount to be transferred reduces the balance of the relevant account from
which such transfer is to be made, when the transfer request process is concluded. We reserve the
right (a) to decline a withdrawal request if the request is not in accordance with the provisions of this
Section, or (b) to delay the processing of the request if we are not satisfied with the ancillary
documentation submitted with the withdrawal request.
You agree, when we so request, to pay any bank transfer fees incurred when you are withdrawing
funds from your account or when funds are refunded by us to your designated bank account. You
are solely responsible for the payments details you are providing us with and we do not accept any
4
responsibility for your funds, if the payment details you have provided to us are incorrect or
incomplete. It is also understood that we do not accept any responsibility for any funds that are not
directly deposited into our bank accounts.
