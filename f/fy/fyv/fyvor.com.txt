Aggregated Information
Aggregated information, such as which page users access or visit, and information volunteered by users is collected through various methods. For example, Fyvor collects IP addresses; an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web. Web servers (the computers that "serve up" Web pages) automatically identify your computer by its IP address; when you request a page from Fyvor, our servers log your IP address.
Fyvor only uses IP addresses for the purposes of Web traffic analysis and trends.
