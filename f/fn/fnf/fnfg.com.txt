First Niagara
What we do
How does First Niagara protect my personal information?  |  To protect your personal information from unauthorized access and use, we use security measures that comply with federal law. These measures include computer safeguards and secured files and buildings.
We partner with third parties and use protocols, tools, and auditing to confirm your identity, help keep transactions secure, and enhance your online experience.
How does First Niagara collect my personal information?  |  We collect your personal information, for example, when you:
open an account or apply for a loan
apply for insurance or seek advice about your investments
give us your contact information
We also collect your personal information from others, such as credit bureaus, affiliates, or other companies.
Why can’t I limit all sharing?  |  Federal law gives you the right to limit only:
sharing for affiliates’ everyday business purposes – information about your creditworthiness
affiliates from using your information to market to you
sharing for nonaffiliates to market to you
State laws and individual companies may give you additional rights to limit sharing.
What happens when I limit sharing for an account I hold jointly with someone else?  |  Your choices will apply to everyone on your account – unless you tell us otherwise.
