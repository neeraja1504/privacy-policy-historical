Public Author Page Information Sharing
FiledBy has entered into agreements with selected third parties such as Ingram Content Group and Copa (DMC Worldwide)(out "Authorized Content Distribution Partners"). Under these agreements, FiledBy receives and shares publicly available author, publication and similar information.

By posting or correcting information about works that you have created or about yourself on a publicly available author page on www.filedby.com, you agree that we may allow our Authorized Content Distribution Partners to access, use and display such information for the purpose of additional author promotion and to improve the accuracy of author information.
