not limited to) when you enroll in a program offered by one of our partners, when you alter your
request for services (i.e., increase your annual spend) and when you report a problem with our

correspondence. SAP Fieldglass may also occasionally ask you to complete surveys that we use for

run). Aggregated versions of this information (information that does not personally identify you)
may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information about your usage patterns,
with similar information obtained from other users to help enhance the application or hosted
environment and our services. Additionally, SAP Fieldglass may keep track of this information and
the information that you provide to us for our internal review, business development, research,
press inquiries or aggregate statistical analysis, customization, demographic patterns, and historical
trends. Aggregate information may occasionally be shared with our business partners and
customers, and this information does not include any personally identifiable information about you
or allow anyone to identify you individually. As SAP Fieldglass adopts additional technology we may
also gather information through other means.

transferred;

•   as otherwise required or authorized by law.

Australia. Such recipients are likely to be located in the jurisdictions in which we have corporate offices –
for example, our main headquarters are located in the United States, with related companies located in
the United Kingdom and Australia. We take reasonable steps to ensure the persons and organizations to
whom we disclose personal information are bound to protect the privacy of that personal information in
accordance with applicable law.
VII. Information Security. We restrict access to personal information about you to those who
need to have that information to provide products or services to you. If we use other companies to
provide products or services to you, we require that they keep the information we share with them safe
and secure. We have physical, logical and procedural safeguards in place that comply with legal
requirements to store and secure information about you from unauthorized access, alteration and

care is taken, we cannot guarantee the security of information that you provide via the SAP Fieldglass
application.
