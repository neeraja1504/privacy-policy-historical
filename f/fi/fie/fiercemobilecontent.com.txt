Privacy Policy | FierceMarkets
We take our readers' privacy very seriously. We are committed to protecting it. We understand that many of our readers entrust us with their contact information, and  we   never  sell or give away that information.
Websites
While our websites use “cookies,” we do not link them to any personally identifiable information. This information is used to enhance the quality of the newsletter sign-up process and to provide general statistics regarding use of the web sites. If you choose to not have your browser accept cookies, you will still be able to view the majority of our sites.
Email Publications
As part of the subscription process for our email publications, we collect basic information such as your name, email address, company, and job function. We never sell or give away this information.
However, we do occasionally send reader surveys and other special notes from the publisher. We also send regular email promotions from our sponsors. In each case we carefully screen promotions for relevance based on your affiliation with a specific FierceMarkets publication, demonstrated interests, and/or professional status. These special promotions allow us to provide you the newsletters free of charge. In sending them, we do everything we can to respect your privacy and time:
We carefully screen every email promotion for relevance;
We typically send no more than one extra email per week;
We clearly mark the emails as from FierceMarkets;
We always include unsubscribe information; and
We never sell or give reader information to the advertiser (these promotions are sent through our system, not theirs).
We also rent our postal mailing list from time to time, albeit rarely. In doing so, we carefully screen each mailing; we use trusted (“bonded”) third-party mailing agencies; and we never give reader contact details directly to the advertiser.
Mobile Apps
