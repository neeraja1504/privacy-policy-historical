Our Commitment to Privacy
Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.
The Information We Collect:
Figi's® and its parent company Mason® Companies, Inc. value and respect your privacy. We collect information about you through our websites and catalog orders in an effort to improve your shopping experience and to communicate our products, services, and promotions to you.
This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the Figi's website. On some pages, you can order products, make requests, and register to receive catalogs or mailings. The types of personal information collected at these pages are:
Name
Address
Email address
Phone number (This is always only optional)
Credit/Debit Card Information (This is only when you place an order)
On some pages, you can submit information about other people. For example, if you order a gift online and want it sent directly to the recipient, you will need to submit the recipient's name and address. In this circumstance, the types of personal information collected are only the name and address of the other person.
The Way We Use Information:
We use the information you provide when placing an order to complete that order. From time to time, we may share information we have collected among our other divisions and, under certain circumstances, with third parties that provide services on our behalf or with carefully screened companies whose products or services we feel may interest you. If you do not wish us to share this information, please relay your request along with your mailing address to us by phone toll free at 1.866.855.0203 or write to us at:
Figi's Companies, Inc.
3200 S. Central Ave.

Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out.
Third Party Advertising
We may contract with third-party companies who use cookies to measure the performance of a marketing effort on our behalf. We may share your personally identifiable information, including your name, address, email address, as well as a record of any transactions you conduct on our website or offline with us with a third-party advertising partner and its service providers in order to deliver to you banner advertisements and other advertising tailored to your interests when you visit certain websites.

Our Commitment to Data Security
Because we all benefit from secure online shopping, we have taken steps to build and manage a system that you can use with confidence. We use sophisticated encryption and authentication tools to protect the security of the personal information that you share with us. The personal information you provide to us is preserved behind a firewall, instead of being directly connected to the Internet. Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Once we receive your transmission, we have appropriate security measures in place within our physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of the personal information you have provided to us.
We urge you to keep your password for our Web site in a safe place and not divulge it to anyone. Also remember to sign off your account and close your browser window when you have finished your visit to any of our Web sites. This is to ensure that others cannot access your account, especially if you are sharing a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place such as a library or Internet cafe.
We use industry-standard efforts such as firewalls, data-encryption methods and password-protected data sources to safeguard the confidentiality of your information. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to reasonably safeguard and secure the information we collect online. If sensitive data is collected through this Web site, we will encrypt your personal information before it travels over the Internet using industry standards for secure online transactions.
How We Use Your Email Address
When you provide us your email address, we will email you as necessary to process your order, respond to a request, or to provide customer service. After you place an order at Figis.com, you will receive an email confirmation. If you receive one of our Figi's gift cards you will also receive an email notifying you of the gift and instructions on how to use the card.
Figi's may also send promotional emails about products, offers, or services that we think you may be interested in. Figi's will only send promotional emails to people who wish to receive them. Instructions on how to unsubscribe is in each email.
Figi's® and our parent company Mason® Companies, Inc. value and respect your privacy. We collect information about you through our websites and when you place an order with us in an effort to improve your shopping experience and to communicate with you about our products, services, and promotions. As described in this policy, from time to time, we may share your information among our other titles and, under certain circumstances, with third parties that provide services on our behalf or with whom we have partnered to offer a particular product or service.
Our Commitment to Children's Privacy
Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. Therefore, we comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), do not permit registration by, and will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. No part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13 years of age.
