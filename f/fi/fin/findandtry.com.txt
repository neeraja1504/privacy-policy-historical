Privacy Policy - FindandTry
Information Collection and Use
Information Collected Upon Registration. If you desire to have access to certain restricted sections of the Site or to order certain products from this Site, you will be required to become a registered user. As part of becoming a registered user or as part of ordering certain products from us as an unregistered user you will be required to submit certain personally identifiable information about yourself and others to FINDANDTRY. This happens in a number of instances, such as when you sign up for the Service. Personally identifiable information that we may collect in such instances may include your name, address, IP address, full user name, password, email address, time zone, telephone number, image/likeness and other information that you decide to provide to us, or that you decide to include in your public and private profile. In addition, we may receive and collect information about you provided to us by another user.
Additional Information. Providing additional information beyond what is required at registration is entirely optional, but enables you to better identify yourself and find products and Services offered by us. If you contact us by email through the Site, we may keep a record of your contact information and correspondence, and may use your email address, and any information that you provide to us in your message, to respond to you.
Use of Contact Information. We may use your contact information to market to you, and provide you with information about, our products and services, including but not limited to our Service. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such information or communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications.
Use of Photographs and Other Profile Information. We may display your photograph, video, name, address, postings, and any other profile information to other Site users (including unregistered visitors), whether pursuant to a search or randomly (including display on the front page of the Site) and on other websites operated by us. We may also share your photograph, video, name, address, postings, and any other profile information with third-parties who may display this information on websites unaffiliated with the Site.
Log Data. When you visit the Site, our servers may automatically record information that your browser sends (either automatically or upon request) whenever you visit a website ("Log Data"). This Log Data may include information (without limitation) such as your IP address, browser type or the domain from which you are visiting, the web-pages you visit, the search terms you use, and any advertisements on which you click. For most users accessing the Internet from an Internet service provider the IP address will be different every time you log on. We may use Log Data to monitor the use of the Site and of our Service, and for the Site's technical administration. We do not associate your IP address with any other personally identifiable information to identify you personally, except in case of violation of the Terms of Service or pursuant to a subpoena or a court order.
Information from other websites. We may institute programs with advertising partners and other websites in which they share information with us:
1. We may ask advertisers to tell us how our users responded to the ads we showed them (and for comparison purposes, how other users who didn't see the ads acted on their site). This data sharing, commonly known as "conversion tracking," helps us measure our advertising effectiveness and improve the quality of the advertisements you see.
2. We may receive information about whether or not you've seen or interacted with certain ads on other sites in order to measure the effectiveness of those ads.
If in any of these cases we receive data that we do not already have, we will "anonymize" it within 180 days, meaning we will stop associating the information with any particular user. If we institute these programs, we will only use the information in the ways we explain within this Privacy Policy.
Information from other users. We may collect information about you from and pursuant to the request of other Site users.
Information Sharing and Disclosure
Service Providers. We engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide services to us, including, without limitation, hosting and maintenance, customer relationship, database storage and management, and direct marketing campaigns. We will share your personally identifiable information with these third parties, but only to the extent necessary to perform these functions and provide such services, and only pursuant to binding contractual obligations requiring such third parties to maintain the privacy and security of your data.
Affiliates. We may share your personally identifiable information, posted content, User Data and all other content and messages provided by you with third-parties who offer their own services to users and direct user traffic to the Site.
Business Transfers. FINDANDTRY may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your personally identifiable information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy. You will have the opportunity to opt out of any such transfer if the new entity's planned processing of your information differs materially from that set forth in this Privacy Policy.
