If you do not wish to have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based advertisements:
Some of our Providers participate in self-regulatory programs for interest-based advertising through the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA). Each of these programs provides an opt-out feature where you can choose not to receive targeted advertising from any NAI member or DAA participant.

Mobile Tracking Technologies for Interest Based Advertising. Most modern mobile operating systems provide mobile advertising identifiers for mobile devices.

Your mobile operating system may allow you to limit use of mobile advertising identifiers for interest-based advertising. For more information, please review the instructions provided by your mobile device manufacturer or click HERE to visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s informational page on advertising choice mechanisms for mobile devices. Click HERE to learn about the Digital Advertising Alliance’s AppChoices app, a tool for opting out of the collection of cross-app data on a mobile device for interest-based advertising by participating service providers.

If you have registered an account on our Site or on our App, you may access and update certain Personal Information that you have provided us by logging into your account and making such changes. If you update your account or if you request we deactivate your account, we may not delete residual copies from our servers and may not remove information associated with the prior version(s) or deactivated account.
Our Security Practices. We use a variety of administrative, contractual, technical and physical controls and safeguards to help protect your Customer Information from loss and unauthorized access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, destruction or similar risks. However, no control or safeguard can completely guarantee that such information is completely secure. As a matter of policy, we do not disclose details regarding our security measures as this could be beneficial information to criminals and other bad actors.
Your Security Practices. You are also responsible for taking reasonable steps to protect your Personal Information against unauthorized disclosure or use.
We encourage you to take steps to help protect the confidentiality and security of your account and Personal Information, including by doing the following:
Review your Finish Line account periodically and immediately report any unexpected activity or unrecognized information
Install the latest security updates and antivirus software on your computer to help prevent malware and viruses
Use complex passwords and not using the same password on more than one Site
Password protect your computer and mobile device
Do not share your passwords with others
Sign out/log off Site sessions to close your session
You may come into contact with emails, texts or mobile alerts that look like they originate from us asking for your Personal Information. For your protection, do not respond to such communications or click on links or open any files attached to such suspicious, unsolicited communications. If you receive such a communication, please email onlinefraud@finishline.com immediately so that we may investigate the suspicious activity.
We provide our Services in the United States and in U.S. Territories (Puerto Rico and Guam). Customer Information we collect is primarily stored in the United States. If you live outside of the United States or U.S. Territory, by using our Services, you understand and agree that we may transfer your Personal Information to and within the United States. Our Site is subject to U.S. laws, which may not provide the same level of protections as those laws in your country.
Third Party Links. If we offer you a link to connect to a third-party website, it is for your convenience. Third-party websites linked to and from our Site, App and Internet Marketing Platforms are not necessarily under our control and we have no responsibility for the content or privacy practices of any such linked website or service.

Do Not Track Signals. Some browsers offer a “Do Not Track” privacy preference. Generally, when a user turns on the Do Not Track Signal, the browser sends a message to websites requesting them not to track the user. Our Site, App and Internet Marketing Platforms currently do not respond to “Do Not Track” signals. However, you have other options for opting out of tracking for interest-based advertising purposes as described in this Privacy Policy.

California Privacy Rights.
Under California’s Shine the Light law, if you are a California resident, you may request and obtain (free of charge) information regarding our disclosure of your personal information (as defined by applicable law) to third parties for their direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year. If applicable, this information would include a list of the categories of personal information shared and the names and addresses of those third parties with which we shared your information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you would like to make such a request please contact us.
Under California’s Online Eraser Law, if you are a California resident who is under 18 years old and are a registered user of our Site or App, you may request and obtain removal of, content or information that you have posted on our Site or App. A request to remove content or information posted by you does not ensure or require complete or comprehensive removal of such content or information from our databases (for example, content that has been reposted by another user may not be removable). If you would like to make such a request please contact us.
International Customers. By using our Services, you consent to your Customer Information collected by us or our third party service providers to be transferred outside your country of residence to countries or jurisdictions where we or our affiliates may have business operations or to engage third parties to provide services to us for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. Such countries may not have the same level of data protection as within your country. If we do make such a transfer, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure your Customer Information is protected.
From time to time, we may change our Privacy Policy and may apply any changes to Customer Information previously collected, as permitted by law. Please check this Privacy Policy periodically so that you are aware of our current privacy practices. When we make material changes to our privacy policies and practices, we will notify you by posting the updated Privacy Policy on our website with an updated effective date at the start of the Policy. However, when we make material changes to our privacy policies and practices around interest-based advertising, we will obtain your consent before applying such change to your data collected before the change. If you do not provide such consent, data collected before the material change will continue to be governed by the policy in effect at the time the information was collected.
You may come into contact with emails, texts or mobile alerts that look like they originate from us asking for your Personal Information. For your protection, do not respond to such communications or click on links or open any files attached to such suspicious, unsolicited communications. If you receive such a communication, please email us at onlinefraud@finishline.com immediately so that we may investigate the suspicious activity.
