Find Local Weather Privacy Policy
We care about your privacy. We want to tell you in detail about the Internet policies and practices which we have adopted to protect your privacy so that you can feel confident about how we handle the personal information you entrust to us online. The server(s) that make(s) this site available may be located outside the country from which you accessed this site, but we will collect, process and use personal information only in accordance with this policy.
While we do not intend to make changes to our policies very often, it is always a good idea to double check when you visit our site to be sure that you have read and agree with our most current policy statement. We will not make any changes that have retroactive effect unless legally required to do so.
The content on our sites may include, among other items of interest, entertainment, games, recipes, surveys, sweepstakes, and contests, and may also include advertising and opportunities to shop online. We may also provide information on our company and our products, and may also offer opportunities to apply for employment. We hope that you enjoy our site and will come back often to visit! **
When do we collect personal information?
** We only collect personally identifiable data, such as names, addresses, e-mail addresses, hobby or activity information, demographic information (age, gender, etc.), taste or preference information, and the like, when voluntarily submitted by a visitor. Visitors may choose to submit personal information to enter contests, to obtain information or submit a comment, to register for a loyalty program or chat room, or to place an order. We make a special effort to advise children to get parental permission before providing information or ordering anything on-line, and urge parents to supervise their children's on-line use. We may ask for age information from children so that we can provide age-relevant content and fulfill certain legal obligations; if we learn we are dealing with a young child, we may ask for the e-mail address of a parent and make an effort to contact them to determine if the child has permission to provide information to us. **
What do we do with the information?
** Providing personal information is up to you, our visitor. We collect personally identifiable information to e-mail you with updates and news, to respond to your questions or comments, to register you for certain features, and/or to send out brochures and other information on our products or our company. We ask visitors providing e-mail addresses to let us know if they would like further information or updates from us or our site; only those who request it will receive follow-up e-mail or other communications from us. Only those who expressly ask to receive such information online will get it. We also offer visitors an "opt-out" option at any time they wish to cease receiving e-mails or other information from us.
Personal information is used solely by us, and our affiliates, agents or business partners who help make this site and its content and the products and services at this site, available to you in order to respond to your requests (like fulfilling online shopping orders or offering a sweepstakes or promotion), and to better serve you, consistent with this policy. **
How do we use "cookies"?
