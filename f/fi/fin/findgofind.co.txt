PLEASE CHECK BACK FREQUENTLY FOR UPDATES
Effective as of November 3, 2015
Browzeable has established this Privacy Policy to disclose our information gathering and dissemination practices for the Browzeable Application and our Services, and to allow you to make an informed decision about how you will use our Services. Our "Services" include the Browzeable Application, and all related services, applications, components, programs, software, listings, directories, tools, updates, databases and information made available and utilized. References to "you" in this Agreement means you, your duly authorized representatives and any entity you may represent in connection with your use of the Services.
By using our Services, you are consenting to the terms of this Privacy Policy and all of the activities described herein. If you do not agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy, you should uninstall Browzeable and not use our Services. We reserve the right to enter into new or different lines of business with consumers and if and to the extent we do, we may display a different privacy policy to the consumer for such lines of business.
This Privacy Policy addresses only our practices with respect to information we collect in the course of using our Services and does not apply to information about you that might be collected by a third party website or an offering linked to or otherwise accessible from our Services. Any information collected, obtained and/or used by any such third parties is subject to the privacy policies of those third parties. We encourage you to review the policies of such third parties. Finally, to the extent any of our Services are undertaken in conjunction with or as a co-branded service with a third party, then both our Privacy Policy and such third party's privacy policy may apply.
Collection of Information and Your Privacy Rights
What information we collect and how we collect it.
1. Collection of Information

(b) We also may collect and store URLS that you visit.
(c) When you use or interact with our Services, we may also collect certain anonymous information that is not sufficient to permit someone to identify you by name, mailing address, telephone number, social security number, driver's license or other government-issued identification. The anonymous information we may have access to, obtain, retain and use may include:
Information about your use of our Services, such as the frequency with which you use them, how you use and interact with them, when you visit them, and your responses to the offerings and advertisements made available to you through them, among other things; and
Information that may be gathered or received when you use the Services or visit other websites, including, without limitation, the following:

(d) All of the foregoing information is collectively referred to hereinafter as "Anonymous Information."

Additionally, those portions of the Services comprised of software have been configured to communicate to us any information relating to computer errors arising from use of such software, without providing any notice to you of the delivery of such communications. Such communications may include the configuration settings applicable at the time of the error. We use this data to help us clarify and fix performance issues with and to improve the software and the Services.
(e) In addition, as part of the functionality provided by our Service, Browzeable assigns a unique user ID, which is stored in the computer registry. This unique user ID is combined with the information collected via the Services in order to provide you a more customized search experience, and to clarify, fix and improve the software and the Services.
2. Use of Information

We will not share your Anonymous Information with third parties unless:
You have given us your prior consent to disclose such information;
The third party is our parent, subsidiary, or an affiliated company owned by our parent company;

We only share anonymized or aggregated information to improve the relevancy of the ads you see.

Furthermore, we may disclose your Anonymous Information to protect our own rights, Services and property or those of our affiliated providers, in addition to providing you with the Services.
(c) In the event that ownership of all or a portion of the Services currently provided by Browzeable were to change as a result of a merger, acquisition or transfer to another company, your Anonymous Information may be transferred as well.
