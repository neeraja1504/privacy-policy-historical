This Policy may change from time to time. Please check back frequently for updates.
Adknowledge EN, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and Findwhat.com (“Findwhat”, “we”, or “us”) respect and protect the privacy of consumers. This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes what information we collect through Findwhat.com, how we use that information, and some of your privacy rights regarding that information.
Collection of Information and Your Privacy Rights
What information we collect and how we collect it.
1. _Subscription or Survey Information_. Findwhat collects information from you when you voluntarily provide it to Findwhat or one of its partners, through websites (owned and operated by Findwhat or a third party), social networking applications and other means (together, these sources are referenced hereafter as "Publishers") (for example, by signing up for an email newsletter or through a co-registration offer on a survey), or by others means of online or offline surveys, order forms, or registration pages operated by third parties (collectively, a "User Form"). In a User Form, Findwhat or a third party may offer you incentives in exchange for providing information about yourself such as name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers, birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, employment information, and personal and online interests (together, "User Information"). Completing the User Form is voluntary and you are under no obligation to provide User Information.
2. _Vendor List Information_. Findwhat may obtain information about you after you provide information to a third party and you permit that party (the "Seller") to share the information, which Findwhat subsequently purchases, licenses, or otherwise lawfully acquires. Such information may include, but is not limited to, your name, street address, zip code, telephone numbers, birth date, gender, salary range, education, marital status, occupation, industry of employment, personal and online interests, and other information which you provided to the Seller (together, "Vendor List Information"). When acquiring Vendor List Information, Findwhat requires assurances from the Seller that the Seller has a right to transfer the Vendor List Information to Findwhat and that Findwhat may lawfully use the Vendor List Information to transmit offers from advertisers.
3. _User Behaviors Collected with Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Information_. Findwhat uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about you, such as your Internet Protocol address and what Web browser you are using, with certain of your online behaviors, such as opening or clicking on a particular online advertisement. Additionally, Findwhat may use other new and evolving sources of information and information gathering in the future (together, "Technology Information").
1. Cookies. A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of your computer that allows Findwhat and/or its partners to identify your IP address with corresponding information in Findwhat's database. Findwhat and/or its partners may use cookies to track individual responses or views of advertisements, and use this information to help predict what other advertisements may be of interest to you and enable you to receive customized advertisements or content. These cookies contain no personally identifiable information. The cookies may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us, such as your email address, that we may share with any third party, solely in hashed, non-human readable form. To learn about how you can opt-out of the receipt of cookies, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices. To learn about how you can remove cookies placed on your computer or prevent the placement of cookies on your computer, please see Section 4 below. To learn more about cookies in general, please visit [http://www.cookiecentral.com](http://www.cookiecentral.com/).
2. A web beacon is programming code used to display an image on a web page and can also transfer an individual's user identification to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired information about the individual. Web beacons enable Findwhat to track certain Web sites you visit or advertisements you view online. Web beacons help determine products or services in which you may be interested and help track online behaviors for marketing purposes. More information about web beacons is available at <http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/W/Web_beacon.html>.
3. Where Technology Information is Collected. Technology Information is collected directly from Findwhat advertisements or indirectly through Publishers that Findwhat contracts with to display advertisements. Such advertisements will usually be displayed within one of the following advertising vehicles:
* _Websites_. Findwhat may set a cookie on your computer when you view advertisements delivered on Publisher websites. After a cookie is set, Findwhat may track how you interact with the advertisement and the Publisher website (for example, registering, purchasing, browsing, etc.).
* _Software Programs_. Similar to Websites, Findwhat displays banner advertisements in software programs that you may use.
* _Email Databases_. Findwhat and/or its partners may track your interaction with email advertisements sent to you (for example, by setting a cookie on your computer) on behalf of Publishers, advertisers or partner websites (for example, when you register, purchase, or browse in response to such email).
4. _Outside Information_. Findwhat may lawfully receive information about you from third parties, such as information located in public databases ("Outside Information").
5. _No Information Collected from Minors_. MINORS UNDER THE AGE OF 18 SHOULD NOT PROVIDE ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION, INCLUDING THEIR EMAIL ADDRESS, TO Findwhat. If Findwhat is notified it has personal information about a minor under the age of 18, that information will be promptly deleted from our database.
6. _Individual Information_. As used herein, Individual Information means User Information, Vendor List Information, Technology Information, Outside Information, and any other information Findwhat lawfully obtains about you.

5. _Storage of Individual Information_. Findwhat stores Individual Information in a database on Findwhat computers; the information is maintained and stored in encrypted form.

Privacy Practices of Third Parties
Advertiser cookies and web beacons. Publishers who place advertisements on the Internet may use their own cookies, web beacons and other technology to collect information about you. Findwhat does not control Publishers' use of such technology. Findwhat may place cookies of its Publishers or advertisers who are under contract with Findwhat, on your computer. These cookies may be placed at the time you open and/or click within email sent by Findwhat or a Publisher under contract with Findwhat. This Policy does not apply to the practices of Publishers or other companies that Findwhat does not own or control or to people that Findwhat does not employ or manage.
Links. The Publishers' Website and email messages transmitted by Findwhat on its own behalf or on behalf of Publishers may contain hypertext links to the Websites of third parties. Findwhat is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such other Websites.
Affiliated Companies that are not Publishers. Findwhat may disclose or transfer Individual Information to wholly owned or controlled Findwhat entities in Findwhat's discretion.
