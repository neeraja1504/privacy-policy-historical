Orders
If you register for a finalsite event, we request certain personally identifiable information from you on our order form. You must provide contact information (such as name, email, and school information) and, for chargeable events, financial information (such as credit card number and expiration date). We use this information for billing purposes for event registration or to contact you if we have difficulty processing your order.
Testimonials
Our client contracts include client permission to post testimonials, both written and video, on our website. Permission to display client reference information (name, school, phone number) is obtained from our clients prior to displaying them on our site.
Surveys
Occasionally we may provide you the opportunity to participate in surveys on our site. If you participate we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys is entirely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and email address). We use this information to improve our finalsite services and product offerings.
Share/Email-a-Page
If you choose to use the +Share link available at the bottom of most site pages, you will be invoking the AddThis tool which is a third party product enabling you to easily send our website links to other sites or to email a page link to a friend.

We use other third parties such as a credit card processor to bill you for goods and services.  For instance, when you register for an event we will share your credit card information with our payment processor as necessary for the third party to provide that service. These third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for promotional purposes.
