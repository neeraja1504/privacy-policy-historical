How we store your data
Where do we store your data?
The personal data we collect is processed at our offices in the UK and in data processing facilities that are provided to us by third parties.
Some of these third parties are located outside the UK and the European Economic Area (EEA). If we ever transfer your personal data outside the UK and the EEA, we take steps to protect your privacy and make sure that the transfers comply with the law.
How long do we store your data for?
We only keep your data long enough to carry out the task it was collected for. The amount of time varies depending on the type of data and how we use it.
Do any third parties process your data?
Like many technology businesses, we use trusted suppliers to host our services (including our websites and apps) and power our business systems. We only choose partners who have appropriate security measures in place to keep your data safe.
We only share your personal data with these suppliers when we absolutely need to. If these suppliers are outside the UK and the EEA, we take steps to protect your privacy and make sure that those transfers comply with the law.
