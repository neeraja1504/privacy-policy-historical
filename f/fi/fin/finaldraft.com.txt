Information Collection (online & offline)
Personal information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, email address, a home, postal or other physical address, other contact information, title, birth date, gender, occupation, industry, personal interests, and other information when needed to provide a service you requested.  When ordering products on our website, you may be asked to provide credit card information. When you browse our website, you do so anonymously, unless you have previously indicated that you wish Cast & Crew to remember your login and password. We do not automatically collect personal information, including your email address. We do log your IP address (the Internet address of your computer) to give us an idea of which part of our website you visit and how long you spend there. We do not link your IP address to any personal information unless you have logged in to our website. Like many other commercial websites, the Cast & Crew website may use a standard technology called a “cookie” to collect information about how you use the site. Please go to “Cookies and Tracking Information” below for more information.
We collect personal information when you register with us for a Cast & Crew account, when you use certain Cast & Crew products or services, when you register to attend a seminar or participate in an online survey, when you ask to be included in an email or other mailing list, or when you submit your personal information to us for any other reason. We receive personal information from or on behalf of our clients in connection with our provision of products and services. We also receive personal information from business partners and vendors.
Access to certain Cast & Crew web pages may require a login and a password. The use of those web pages, and the information or programs downloadable from those pages, may be governed by a written agreement between your employer and Cast & Crew. Unless you request deletion of your personal information as specified below, your personal information may be retained by Cast & Crew to verify compliance with the agreement, log software licenses granted, to track software downloaded from those pages, or track usage of other applications available on those pages.
Cast & Crew will collect and process our clients’ and their employees’ personal information in accordance with the terms of our agreements with the client (the employer)  and applicable law. We will at all times maintain reasonable and appropriate security controls that are in alignment with industry related security frameworks to include HIPAA and the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to protect your information.
Cast & Crew will only disclose personal information to the employer and to other entities in accordance with the terms of our agreements with the employer and applicable law. We may disclose your personal information to our affiliates and data processors as needed to provide the services that you and the employer have requested. These entities are all contractually bound to limit use of your personal information as needed to perform the services. We will also disclose personal information when required to do so by law, such as in response to a subpoena, including to law enforcement agencies and courts in the United States and other countries where we operate.
If you are based outside of the United States, your personal information may be transferred to Cast & Crew affiliates and data processers in the United States and elsewhere in the world. We will always protect the privacy and security of your personal information, regardless of where it is processed. Personal information transfers from the European Economic Area and other countries with data transfer restrictions will be authorized by approved model contract provisions or other appropriate means.

Right to Opt Out

This means we assume you have given us your consent to collect and use your information in accordance with this Global Privacy Statement unless you take affirmative action to indicate that you do not consent.
Cookies and Tracking Technology
A cookie is a small data file that certain websites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you have visited, but the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie cannot read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Some parts of Cast & Crew’s website use cookies to track user traffic patterns. We do this in order to determine the usefulness of our website information to our users and to see how effective our navigational structure is in helping users reach that information. If you prefer not to receive cookies while browsing our website, you can set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies and refuse the cookie when your browser alerts you to its presence. You can also refuse all cookies by turning them off in your browser, although you may not be able to take full advantage of our website if you do so. In particular, you may be required to accept cookies in order to complete certain actions on our website. You do not need to have cookies turned on, however, to use/navigate through many parts of our website, except access to certain of Cast & Crew’s web pages may require a login and password.
Information Sharing and Disclosure
Your personal information may be shared with Cast & Crew’s subsidiaries or affiliates. All such entities are governed by this Global Privacy Statement or are bound by the appropriate confidentiality and data transfer agreements.
Inside Cast & Crew, data is stored in controlled servers with limited access. Your information may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country where Cast & Crew, its subsidiaries, affiliates or agents are located.

We will also disclose your personal information if required to do so by law, to enforce our Terms of Use, or in urgent circumstances, to protect personal safety, the public or our websites.  Cast & Crew further reserves the right to create, utilize and share with third parties anonymized data which may be derived from personal information but does not contain an personally identifying information in its amalgamated form.
Data Security
Your Cast & Crew account information, if applicable, is password-protected for your privacy and security. Cast & Crew safeguards the security of the data you send us with physical, electronic, and managerial procedures. In certain areas of our websites, we use industry-standard SSL-encryption to enhance the security of data transmissions. While we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure the security of the information you transmit to us, and so we urge you to take every precaution to protect your personal data when you are on the internet. Change your passwords often, use a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure browser.
Software Piracy
We are committed to addressing and eliminating piracy or other misuse of our software and products.  As part of these efforts, we may include a security mechanism that can detect the installation or use of unauthorized or modified copies of our software and collect and transmit data about those copies.  This data collection is not designed to be performed on users of properly and legally licensed software obtained from us or our authorized resellers.  If you do not consent to the collection and transmission of such data (including to the United States), you must not use our software.
