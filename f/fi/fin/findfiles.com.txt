The FindFiles Mirror Database can be used automatically when downloading files if you use the GetRight® * download manager.
Using FindFiles.com for automatic mirror searching is off by default when you install GetRight, so you need to turn it on if you wish to use this service.
When searching with this service, GetRight will send at least the file Name (such as setup123.exe ) and the file Size. You may optionally also include the URL so it can be added to the FindFiles.com database and help others searching for the same file. With any Internet connection, your IP address is available to the server you connect to; but no other personally identifying information is sent. The intent of this service is NOT to track individual user's downloads. It is to anonymously build a database of mirrors for downloads so everyone can benefit from faster and more reliable downloads.
If you do not want to use this service, make sure the item is unchecked on the "Mirror Search" configuration page in GetRight ( it is turned off by default.)
Even when enabled, GetRight will not use this service for all downloads. GetRight will only use this service for:
EXE or Compressed file types--EXE, ZIP, RAR, etc. No images, MP3s, web pages, etc.
Downloads that do not use a username/password.
Files at least 100K in size.
There are a number of filters on the server side, for specific names or addresses that should be excluded from the FileMirrors system. For example to exclude "cracks", key-generators, or other files. These files are not added to the database, so you'd never get any results if you search for something that fits the server's filters.
Any files including " personal " or " private " or " members " or " user " or " secret " or " /~ " anywhere in the URL are also excluded from the FileMirrors system.
If you find a file you believe should be removed, please contact us via contact form including the file name and/or URL and why it should be excluded.
The information in the database may be used for aggregate statistics for things like the Top Downloads on the FindFiles.com website.
If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us via contact form.
Several other download managers use the FindFiles.com service. Notably, Lightning Download™, and the resurected Go!Zilla™.
