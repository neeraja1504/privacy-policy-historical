Privacy Policy
Your right to privacy is of the utmost importance to us.
We understand that you are providing us with your personal information and that it is vital for us to earn your trust to provide our services to you effectively.
We believe it is our responsibility to protect your personal information. The services we provide are based on preserving your anonymity until you choose to disclose further personal details.
We will never sell or rent your personal information to third parties. We release personal information only with your permission (including as outlined below in this Privacy Policy), or when we believe release is appropriate for legal compliance and law enforcement (such as to government agencies with statutory law enforcement responsibilities); to facilitate court proceedings; enforce or apply our terms and conditions; or to protect the rights or safety of our users or others. We have designed a thorough privacy policy with these things in mind.
If you have any questions regarding our privacy policy, we encourage you to contact our privacy officer through our contact form.
This privacy policy was last updated on 5th June 2014.

If you select "show my photos to anyone" your photo (and profile) may also appear in the FindSomeone newsletter. If you wish to remove your profile from the FindSomeone website, you may do this using the "remove my profile" link on your settings page.
