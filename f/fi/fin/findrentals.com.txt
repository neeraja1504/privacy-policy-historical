The FindRentals.com Customer Privacy Policy has been developed as an extension of our commitment to combine the finest quality products and services with the highest level of integrity in dealing with our customers.

The FindRentals.com site may, from time to time, modify this Customer Privacy Policy to reflect legal, technological and other developments. In that event the changes will appear at this location. Our Policy recognizes two kinds of personal data that deserve varying levels of protection. Personally-Identifiable Information includes, for example, e-mail addresses, billing information, employment status and "click stream" data that tracks user activity on a Web site or online service. FindRentals.com is committed to using all reasonable efforts to abide by the following Policy statement:

Such activities are beyond the control of FindRentals.com.

Review and correction.
