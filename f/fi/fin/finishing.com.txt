Privacy policy
the home page of the finishing industry Â®
You can view everything on this site without providing any personal info
This website is "no registration / no passwords" for reference & open browsing.
Finishing.com doesn't track you, and we don't have or sell any databases or mailing lists.
Information collected which you DON'T deliberately supply ...
Advertisements and analytic software served by 3rd Parties may track you.
Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our site. Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to our users based on their visits to our site and other sites on the Internet. Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy, and read more.
How Google uses information from sites or apps that use their services
Amazon and other sellers of books and products might insert tracking code or send cookies if you click on their links.
If you click thru to one of our advertisers' sites, we may maintain a "click-thru log" of date, time, and IP address in order to show that we send traffic to advertisers. All web server software (to our knowledge) also captures date, time, and IP address in temporary log files to block the IP addresses of hackers, etc.
Information which you DO deliberately supply ...
Finishing.com isn't restricted to being solely a reference site, it can also be a place of camaraderie. So if you choose to submit a posting, we require and print your name, city, & state -- like a newspaper or magazine would. We will delete your last name or entire posting upon request, but you may be unwelcome to post in the future because deleting postings drills holes in our site and is insulting to the readers who tried to help you.
If you do a posting here, we also require your e-mail address & IP address. We don't print your e-mail address, but we use it to advise you of responses to your posting. We capture your IP address as a guard against fictitious postings (one poster pretending to be another).
We can't generally post public recommendations of suppliers, but if you're looking for a supplier, you can CHOOSE to post an RFP/RFQ and we'll pass along the contact information you supply to suppliers who wish to respond to it. When we do so, we attach the following instruction--
-------
PRIVACY NOTICE: This contact info is forwarded to you under the terms agreed to by the inquirer who provided it. You may respond to THIS SPECIFIC INQUIRY but you may not add this contact information to any database, send any unsolicited offerings of any type to the inquirer, nor pass this contact info to any third party.
-------
Complaints:
If you feel that anyone has spammed you through info available from this site, or you wish to delete a posting you made here, or you have any privacy concerns, please let us know. Thanks!
