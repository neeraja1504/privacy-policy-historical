How does Filson protect children's privacy?
Filson is concerned about the safety of children when they use the Internet and will not request personally identifiable information from anyone whom we know to be under the age of 13.
What are cookies? How does Filson use cookies on its site?
A cookie is a small data file that websites often store on your computer's hard drive when you visit their sites. A cookie may contain information, such as a unique user ID that websites use to track the pages of the sites you've visited. We use cookies but do not store personally identifiable information in your cookie.
We use cookies in order to improve your shopping experience. Cookies enable us to keep track of your order as you shop on our site.
Through our use of cookies, we also track and maintain the identity of the website you visited immediately prior to visiting our website. We do not otherwise track any information about your use of other websites.
We use the services of a third party to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and determine how customers use our website. For this activity, we use web beacons and cookies provided by this third party, which enable us to collect the following types of information: pages visited, products viewed and/or purchased, search term usage, and other common website metrics. This information helps us to learn things like what pages are most attractive to our customers, which of our products most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see. Although our third party service provider collects this information on our behalf, we and the service provider who operates our website on our behalf control how the information may and may not be used.
How do I know my order information is secure?
Protecting your order information is important to us. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect your online order information as it is transmitted over the Internet.
Some versions of browsers and some firewalls don't permit communication through secure servers like the ones we use to process orders at Filson. To check the security of your connection, look at the lower left-hand corner of your browser window after accessing our server. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser), then SSL is active. You can also double-check by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing our secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https."
If your browser or firewall doesn't support SSL, you will not be able to connect to our server, which means you won't be able to mistakenly place an order through an unsecured connection. If you cannot access the secure server for any reason, please call us at 1-866-860-8906 and we would be happy to help you by telephone.
What about links to other websites and services?
This website may contain links to other websites. Neither Filson nor our service providers control the privacy policies or practices of these websites. You should review those policies before providing any personal information. Neither Filson nor our service providers are responsible for the content or practices of any linked websites, and we provide these links solely for the convenience and information of our visitors.
