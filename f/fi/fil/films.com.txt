Films Media Group - Privacy Policy
FILMS MEDIA GROUP PRIVACY POLICY
Films Media Group is strongly committed to protecting your privacy and providing a safe online experience for all of our users while offering the highest quality educational media to them. Because we gather certain types of information about and from users so that we can fulfill your requests and better serve your needs, we feel you should fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding the collection and use of this information. This privacy statement discloses what information we gather, how we use it, how to correct or change it, and what steps we take to safeguard personal information provided to us both online and offline. Please read the complete Online Privacy Policy below, as well as our Terms and Conditions of Use, and contact us if you have any questions.
WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU?
You can visit our website without giving us any personally identifiable information. So that we can provide our users with the most efficient, enhanced, and personalized service, we request information about you in certain circumstances, and also collect certain information automatically. We also use contact lists and other information we may obtain from third parties. For the convenience of our customers and to better serve you, a customer account includes all the collected personal information we may have, but you can update or correct your contact information or change your preferences about receiving offers and information from us at any time.
Information Users Volunteer
We collect personally identifiable information such as names, mailing addresses, and/or email addresses when you place an order (see the section below for more information on orders), or through optional, voluntary registration at our website. Website visitors may register to receive email updates, offers, catalogs or promotions. Registration may also be requested in connection with certain surveys. Registration can be accomplished by submitting your email address, name, address, phone number and institution. Our registration form will indicate what information is required and what information (if any) is optional. This information will be collected during registration on our site or in connection with specific activities (for example, when placing an order).
Orders
If you wish to place an order online, you must either establish a credit card account with us or go through a purchase order approval process. In addition to the customary information needed to fill your order (full name, address, ship-to name and address), orders necessitate collection of additional personal information, such as your credit card number and credit card expiration date, or your purchase order number.
Information Collected Automatically
We also may collect your IP address, browser type, access times and referring website address. This helps facilitate your online experience at our website. In addition, we may use cookies to track usage patterns at our site. See below for more detail on cookies.
WHAT DO WE DO WITH COLLECTED INFORMATION?
We use information you provide to fulfill your requests and improve our products.
We use personal information so that we may display or send custom, personalized content to our website visitors and to send newsletters, mail, emails, features, promotional material, surveys and other updates, information or offers to our users. A user may, at any time, opt out of receiving such information. We also use collected information to evaluate and administer our products and services, fulfill customer requests, respond to any problems that may arise (such as delivery issues, difficulties in navigating our site or accessing certain features), as well as to gauge user trends to determine what products and services are most popular with users.
Of course, we use personal information to allow you to make product purchases at our website. Rest assured that we and our technical and fulfillment agents and consultants follow careful procedures to safeguard credit card data in connection with your transactions.
HOW DO WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION?
Personal information is available to Films Media Group and its technical and fulfillment agents and consultants who make this site and our products and services available to you. We share your personal information with third parties only with your prior permission.
Films Media Group and Its Agents
Films Media Group may access any personal information you provide for internal marketing purposes, including sending you notice of new publications, services or products we offer likely to be of interest, and filling orders. To facilitate orders, Films Media Group will cache your order information, and create an authorization with a merchant account (i.e., your credit card company) if you use a credit card to make a purchase. There are many companies who may be required to assist Films Media Group in making its products and website available to you. Web host firms and technical and database consultants may have access to personally identifiable information in the course of making our products and services available. All companies working for Films Media Group must comply with our information collection, use and disclosure policies, and are not permitted to sell your information to third parties or to use it except as authorized by us and you, or as permitted or required by law.
Credit Card Companies
As in any transaction, your credit card company will receive relevant information about the item(s) purchased, your name, and your billing address. Films Media Group will not otherwise provide any personal data to your credit card company.
Important Note
We reserve the right to use or disclose any information without notice or consent as needed to satisfy any law, regulation or legal request; to conduct investigations of consumer complaints or possible breaches of law; to protect the integrity of our site and our property; to protect the safety of our visitors or others; to fulfill your requests; or to cooperate in any legal investigation.
