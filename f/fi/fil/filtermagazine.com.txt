However, certain non-personal information of users (for example, the type of browser being used, the operating system used by the user and the domain name of the user's Internet service provider) is collected. This information is primarily used for internal purposes, but only in an aggregate form (individual users cannot be identified). Personally identifiable information may be collected from users of filter-mag.com / filter magazine.com when users voluntarily provide this information. All such personal information is retained by filter magazine and is not sold or otherwise transferred by filter magazine unless the express consent to do so has been obtained or if filter magazine is required by law or by a court or governmental order to disclose such information in a particular circumstance. This information is used by filter magazine to better understand usage patterns and to enhance user enjoyment of filter magazine.com. Aggregate information may be shared with advertisers; however, as is set forth more fully below, no data concerning users under the age of 13 is ever used. filter magazine sometimes uses e-mail addresses and other personally identifiable information to contact users who provide their e-mail addresses for specific purposes. Each communication will contain instructions on how to discontinue receipt of such communications.

If, for example, filter magazine offers certain promotional items to users of the website, such as a promotional compact disc or t-shirt, filter magazine requests that such interested party provide his or her name and mailing address in order to send the web site visitor the promotional item. The visitor's email address is used only if we need to contact the visitor to verify name and mailing address. This information is not retained after the item has been delivered, and filter magazine does not use it for any other purpose.

Information submitted in order to participate in a contest is not used for any other purpose. In some circumstances, filter magazine also asks child visitors to this site to provide filter magazine with his or her parent's or guardian's contact information so that filter magazine may contact the child visitor's parent or guardian to notify them of filter magazine' information practices with respect to children, to notify that person of a child's participation on this site, and/or to seek the consent of the parent or guardian to such participation. The parent or guardian of any person under the age of 13 whose personal information has been collected on this site may ask to review that personal information and may, if they so choose, request that such information be deleted, and that no additional information be gathered by filter magazine.
