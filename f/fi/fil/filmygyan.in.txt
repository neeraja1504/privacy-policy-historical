*** Children's Guidelines ( Children under 13 ):**
You are not allowed to register with Filmygyan or use the site unless you are at least 13 years old. Privacy Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, Filmygyan does not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information or non-personally-identifiable information on the Filmygyan Sites from persons under 13 years of age, and no part of our website is directed to persons under 13. If you are under 13 years of age, then please do not use or access the Filmygyan Sites at any time or in any manner. If Filmygyan learns that personally identifiable information of persons under 13 years of age has been collected on the Filmygyan Sites without verified parental consent, then Filmygyan will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.
*** Being Anonymous**
The fact that you can send messages without other people knowing who you are is part of what makes Filmygyan unique and so much fun. It means that you can ask things that you might be too embarrassed or shy to say if anyone knew it was you. People are often bolder and more honest when they are anonymous, whether they're asking a question anonymously, or answering a question where they don't know who's asked it.
The thing is though, that it also means that when you receive questions or comments, you may not know who they come from either!
Some people don't like receiving things from people if they don't know who they are. So every member can choose not to receive questions from anonymous users on the 'Settings' page.
We all know that some people might abuse the option to be anonymous by being mean or by saying horrible things because they know you don't know who they are, but we will take steps to stop them from spoiling it for everyone else.
We may assist the Police or other law enforcement agencies with their requests to the extent required by law – otherwise, will not tell anyone who you are if you want to remain anonymous.
Occasionally, a member may ask us if we can tell them the IP address of someone who sent them an anonymous message. Unfortunately, we are not able to give out that information.
