It is completely optional for you to engage in these activities and/or make any purchases. If you elect to engage in these activities or make purchases, however, Filter Forge may ask that you provide us personal information, defined as any information that identifies or can be used to identify, contact, or locate the person to whom such information pertains, including but not limited to your first and last name, mailing address (including ZIP code), email address, employer, phone number and other personal information.

When you submit personal information to Filter Forge through this Website, you understand and agree that this information may be transferred across national boundaries and may be stored and processed in any of the countries in which Filter Forge and its affiliates and subsidiaries operate. You also acknowledge that in certain countries or with respect to certain activities, the collection, transferring, storage, and processing of your information may be undertaken by trusted vendors of Filter Forge. Such vendors are bound by contract not to use your personal information for their own purposes or provide it to any third parties.
Filter Forge may establish relationships with various service providers whose services may become available to you from this Website or from other websites that are linked to this Website, as described in the section "Third Party Websites".

Securing the Transmission and Storage of Information

Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary, and only authorized individuals have access to the information provided by our users. Filter Forge takes steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you use these services at your own risk.
We treat the information you provide to us as confidential information; it is, accordingly, subject to our company's security procedures and corporate policies regarding protection and use of confidential information. After personally identifiable information reaches Filter Forge it is stored on a server with physical and electronic security features as customary in the industry, including utilization of login/password procedures and electronic firewalls designed to block unauthorized access from outside of Filter Forge. Because laws applicable to personal information vary by country, our offices or other business operations may put in place additional measures that vary depending on the applicable legal requirements. Information collected on the sites covered by this Privacy Policy is processed and stored in the United States of America and possibly other jurisdictions and also in other countries where Filter Forge and its service providers conduct business. All Filter Forge employees and consultants are aware of our privacy and security policies. Your information is only accessible to those employees who need it in order to perform their jobs.

Disclosure of Information to Third Parties
Filter Forge does use the services of third parties, such as hosting providers, shipping and payment processing companies that act as independent contractors on behalf of Filter Forge. These parties are contractually prohibited from using personally identifiable information for any purpose other than for the purpose Filter Forge specifies. We do provide non-personally identifiable information to certain service providers for their use on an aggregated basis for the purpose of performing their contractual obligations to us. We prohibit the sale or transfer of personal information to entities outside of the Filter Forge's affiliates for their use without your approval.
Filter Forge may disclose your personally identifiable information if we believe in good faith that we are required to do so in order to comply with applicable law, a subpoena, or other legal process. Filter Forge may also disclose personally identifiable information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating this Privacy Policy, the terms of your agreements with the Company or to protect the safety of our users and the public or under confidentiality and licensing agreements with certain third parties which assist us in developing, operating and maintaining the Website and its content.
In the event that all or substantially all of Filter Forge's stock and/or all or substantially all assets are transferred or sold to another entity, Filter Forge may transfer personally identifiable information to the acquiring entity. If, as a result of such a business transition, your personally identifiable information will be used in a materially different manner, you will be given choice consistent with our policy regarding notification of changes.
Choices Available to You
You can always choose whether or not to disclose personally identifiable information and that choice will not prevent you from using the Filter Forge Website. Please note, however, if you should choose to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with some of the services dependent upon the collection of this information.
To prevent Filter Forge from collecting the statistical information about how you surf this Website, you may disable cookies and Javascript in your web browser. However, if you choose to do that, we will be unable to provide you with web-based services that require cookies, including without limitation, creation or updating of your personal account, posting messages on the online forums, sending messages via our contact forms, purchasing software and services.

However, in this case we will be unable to provide you with the services that require a valid personal account, including without limitation participation in beta testing of Filter Forge's software, posting messages on the online forums, downloading and submitting downloadable content via Filter Forge's software, or receiving important notifications sent by Filter Forge.
If you choose to create your personal account, you may choose to fill in only the fields marked as mandatory.
If you have already created your personal account and do not wish us to keep using the information on account, you may choose to deactivate the account. If you choose to do so, we will be unable to provide you with services that require a personal account after your account is deactivated. The deactivation is performed upon request which you can send to us via www.filterforge.com/contact/.

We reserve the right to send you emails related to Filter Forge website, software and services, including without limitation confirmation emails when you create or update your personal account, emails announcing the availability of new versions of Filter Forge's software, and service alert emails to inform you of specific changes that may impact your ability to use a service you have previously signed up for. We also reserve the right to contact you if compelled to do so as part of a legal proceeding or if there has been a violation of any applicable licensing, warranty and purchase agreements.
Filter Forge is retaining these rights because in limited cases we feel that we may need the right to contact you as a matter of law or regarding matters that will be important to you. These rights do not allow us to contact you to market a new or existing service if you have asked us not to do so, and issuance of these types of communications is rare.
If you wish to opt out of receiving emails, the sharing or retention of any personal identification information, or otherwise change your personal preferences, you must contact Filter Forge by email at www.filterforge.com/contact/.

When you create a personal account with Filter Forge and provide your email address, based on your personal preferences, we may periodically contact you via email and provide information about special offers and promotions that may be of interest to you. These communications will relate to Filter Forge offers and/or the promotions of select, reputable third parties with whom Filter Forge has a strategic marketing relationship because they offer products or services that we believe would be of interest to you. We may use a third party email service provider to send emails. This service provider is prohibited from using your email address for any purpose other than to send Filter Forge related email.
