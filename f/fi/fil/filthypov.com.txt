1. Personal Information Collected
We collect personal information that you choose to provide voluntarily when using The Website. This information includes your name, email address and a password when you create an Account. While you can browse our online store without opening an account, you will need to create an account in order to make purchases and take advantage of certain features.

If a person under 18 years of age has provided Us with personally identifiable information, we ask that a parent or guardian immediately contact Customer Service for assistance.

When you make a purchase using a credit card, we collect your name and billing address for the card, the card type, number, and expiration date. We collect this information in order to verify your billing address. We also collect information that allows us to ship your purchase and keep you informed of the status of your order.

Cookies & Computer Information
When you visit The Website, you will be assigned a "cookie" (a small, unique identifier text file) to be stored on your computer's hard drive. The purpose of the cookie is to identify you when you visit The Website so that we can enhance and customize your online shopping experience.
You can choose to shop on The Website without cookies, but without these identifier files you will not be able to take advantage of certain features of our site.

To shop without cookies, you can configure your browser to reject all cookies or notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.)

This information may include your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your computer's operating system, browser type and the address of a referring website, if any. We collect this information to enhance the quality of your experience during your visit to our site.
We have turned on Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting to get an idea of our demographics and users' interests. You can opt-out of the Google Analytics Advertising Features we use through Ads Settings, Ad Settings for mobile apps, or any other available means (for example, the NAI's consumer opt-out at http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/  ).

If you would like to opt-out of receiving these emails from Us or our affiliates, please click on Your Account and follow the instructions outlined in the Notification Options section.
We also do not sell other personal customer information to unaffiliated third-parties.

Aside from the purposes described above, we may also disclose your personal information in special circumstances if required to do so by law, court order or other governmental authority or when we believe in good faith that disclosing this information is otherwise necessary or advisable, including, for instance, to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interfering with the rights or property of EmpireCtores.Co, another user or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.
4. Controlling the Use of Your Personal Information
Creating an account lets us provide a better shopping experience for you and allows you to make purchases more conveniently without having to re-enter your payment and shipping information each time you make a purchase on our site.

We may periodically send you email messages describing new items, sales, specials and other offers that we think will be of interest to you. If you would like to opt-out of receiving these emails from Us, please click on Your Account click on "Notification Options" and remove the check in the box next to the "Sales & Specials" notification option. You can also opt-out of receiving these messages by clicking the "Unsubscribe" link in the email message itself.
The only email messages you will receive from us when you elect not to receive informational emails will be to confirm any purchases you make on our site, let you know your order has been shipped, respond to your Help Desk inquiries and to answer any other questions you may have about our site. We may also need to send operational emails to inform you of any changes to our site that might affect your personal information, or to announce product recalls.
6. How we Protect your Personal Information
The security of your personal information is very important to us. In our efforts to protect your online transactions, we use a technology called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). If your browser is capable of SSL (and most are), your personal information will be automatically encrypted, or encoded, before it is sent over the Internet.
We have also obtained a digital certificate from DigiCertÂ®, a leading provider of Internet trust services. When you enter a secure portion of our site (which is any page containing any of your personal information), an image of a closed lock or a solid key should appear in the bottom bar of your browser window. If you click on this image, a small pop-up window displaying site-security information will appear. This certificate guarantees that your personal information is being transmitted in secure (encrypted) form to an EmpireStores.Co web server, not to some unknown or unauthorized server.
Ultimately, your personal information is protected by the password that you entered when you created an account (or another password you chose after changing a previous password). Please keep this password confidential. The confidentiality of your password is your responsibility to protect. You may change it anytime by going to Your Account, then click "Change Password" and enter a new password.
7. Changes to the Privacy Policy
We reserve the right to change, modify or amend this Privacy Policy at any time, without prior notice, and we encourage you to check this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. You are responsible for regularly reviewing this Privacy Policy and your continued use of The Website constitutes your agreement as to all such updated or modified Privacy Policies. By using or visiting The Website, you acknowledge that you have read, understand and agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this policy, then do not use or visit The Website.
8. How to Contact Us
