Privacy Policy
Five Guys ("us" or "we") respects the privacy of visitors to our Sites. This Privacy Policy is intended to inform you of our policies and practices regarding the collection, retention, use, and disclosure of any Personal Information through our Sites.
Five Guys provides certain websites, including the websites available at http://www.fiveguys.com, https://five-guys-gear.myshopify.com, and https://games.fiveguys.com (each, a "Site"). By submitting any information through a Site, you acknowledge and agree that Five Guys may process (i.e., collect, use, etc.) your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.
THE TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT
Five Guys collects Personal Information and Anonymous Information from you when you visit a Site and/or send us information or communications. "Personal Information" means information that allows someone to identify or contact you, including, for example, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, IP Address, and any information about you that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing information. "Anonymous Information" means information that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Information, including any feedback you may provide. Anonymous Information does not permit the identification of individual persons. We collect and use Personal Information and Anonymous Information as described in this Privacy Policy.
PERSONAL INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE TO US
We may collect Personal Information that you voluntarily submit to us through your access and/or use of a Site, including contact information such as your name, phone number, and e-mail addresses; billing information including billing name and address; and photographs. When you purchase something from our store, as part of the buying and selling process, we collect the Personal Information you give us such as your name, billing address, shipping address, phone number, and e-mail address.
PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED VIA TECHNOLOGY
As you access or use a Site, to make the Sites more useful to you, we use technological means to collect information from you (including some Personal Information), including the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) you just came from, the URL you go to next, your browser type, your Internet Service Provider (ISP), and your Internet Protocol (IP) address. We may also use cookies and pixels to collect Personal Information from you about your use of our Sites.
An "IP Address" is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. In some cases your IP address stays the same from browser session to browser session. However, if you use a consumer internet access provider, your IP address probably varies from session to session. We track IP addresses solely in conjunction with session cookies to analyze our web page flow.
"Cookies" are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer's hard drive while you are viewing a website. Five Guys uses both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until they expire or until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on the Sites. Persistent cookies can be removed by following the help directions for your internet browser. If you choose to disable all or most cookies, some areas of the Site may not work properly.
In addition to cookies, Five Guys uses "pixels" to enable certain cookies or advertisements on the Sites and to track the number of times a link or advertisement is served on a webpage. A pixel is a tiny, 1x1 image that is loaded when you visit our Sites, but instead of calling up an image, it causes a cookie or application to be downloaded. Pixels can be used to track user activities, track the number of times a user has viewed a particular link or advertisement, track and optimize website traffic, display advertisements, keep track of advertising commissions, and otherwise collect data for online marketing and website analysis. As with cookies, our Sites utilize both session pixels and persistent pixels.
We also use cookies and tracking/marketing pixels for four general purposes:
to ensure the functionality, optimization, and ease of use of our Sites
to ensure and maintain the security of our Sites
to collect anonymous, statistical data regarding how visitors interact with the Sites
for marketing purpose
We also utilize the tools available through Google Analytics in order to monitor site flow and statistical data regarding our Site users.
The cookies that we use for functionality and security purposes are considered necessary cookies, without which the Site would not function properly. These cookies allow some of the basic functions of our Sites to work properly, such as remembering your preferences as you navigate the Sites. In addition, these cookies help us secure the Sites by preventing cross-site request forgery attacks and by throttling excessive request rates.
We also use cookies to collect statistical information regarding how visitors interact with our Sites and to track repeat visits to our Sites. While these cookies collect information regarding how you use our Sites in order to help us understand site flow and improve our website, all such statistical data is anonymous and does not personally identify you.
Finally, we use both cookies and pixels on our Sites for marketing purposes, including: to check whether your browser supports the use of cookies, to deliver general advertisements from third party advertisers, to present targeted advertisements to particular Site visitors, to track the particular advertisements that have been displayed to you, to collect data regarding how you interact with YouTube videos across different websites, to estimate your bandwidth on pages with integrated YouTube videos, to track your browser activity across devices and marketing channels, to track the actions you take after viewing an advertisement in order to measure the efficacy of the advertisement, and to display particular advertisements in order to re-engage visitors that are likely to convert to customers based on those visitors’ online behavior across websites.
HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION
In general, we use your Personal Information to respond to your requests with respect to our Sites and to charge your credit card the cost and transaction fee associated with any Products you order.

Please note, regardless of your communication settings, we may continue to communicate with you regarding changes to terms and conditions, Privacy Policy updates, data breaches, or other significant information related to your Personal Information for as long as it is retained by Five Guys.
We may create Anonymous Information records from Personal Information by excluding information (such as your name and/or IP address) that would allow someone to identify a specific individual. We may use this Anonymous Information to analyze request patterns and usage patterns so that we may enhance our products and services. Five Guys reserves the right to use and disclose Anonymous Information to third parties in its discretion.
If you provide feedback on any of our products or services to us, we may use such feedback for any purpose, provided we will not associate such feedback with your Personal Information.
