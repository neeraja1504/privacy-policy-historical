All test content is private and confidential, and will not be shared with any third-parties or published in any form without prior written approval.
Your tests are not visible to other members of UsabilityHub except upon request in the form of a response order.

To enable Stripe to provide secure payment facilities it will typically acquire information which may include the Cardholder's name, credit card number (with the expiry date) and billing address. Stripe uses the information to obtain authorization of the transaction from the Issuing bank of the credit card to process the payment. Some details from the transaction (including name, email, and delivery address) are made available to UsabilityHub. Credit card numbers and CVC numbers are handled exclusively by Stripe in accordance with PCI Data Security Standards (PCI DSS) and are not made available to UsabilityHub.
