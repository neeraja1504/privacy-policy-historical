Privacy Policy
Fitness Anywhere LLC ("Fitness Anywhere") respects your privacy, and is committed to reasonable measures to safeguard personally identifiable information you may share with us.

Typically, such information comprises customer demographics, traffic patterns, sales, and site usage. This information is used for our commercial purposes, including to improve usability, performance and effectiveness of the website.
