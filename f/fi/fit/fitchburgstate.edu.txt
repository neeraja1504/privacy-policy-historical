Website Privacy Policy
This privacy policy governs your use of Fitchburg State websites (“Sites”) and mobile
applications (“Mobile Apps”), created by Fitchburg State University.
This document informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure
of Personal Information we receive from users of our Sites and Mobile Apps.
What We Collect
Fitchburg State collects two kinds of information on its Sites and Mobile Apps:
1) User Provided Information
This is information you voluntarily supply when you visit the Sites and Mobile Apps, such as
when you:
• Register an account;
• Fill out a form to request information;
• Apply for admissions or request services;
• “Opt-in” for participation in a service;
• Complete a survey;
• Engage with other site features.
2) Automatically Collected Information
This is non-personal information that is collected automatically as you navigate the Sites and
Mobile Apps, such as:
• The name of the domain and host from which you access the Web;
• The geographic location of your point of connectivity;
• The Internet Protocol (“IP”) address of the computer you are using;
• The browser used and the operating system you are using;
• The date and time you access the site;
• Visitor-specific information such as the pages accessed/visited, the order in which they
were visited, the time spent on those pages, the hyperlinks employed, and the Internet
address of the website linked directly to this site.
In addition, we may use third party services such as Google Analytics that collect, monitor and
analyze this information including age, gender and interest categories. This information may be
used to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain
content and better understand online activity.
Cookies
Cookies are files containing small amounts of data, which may include an anonymous unique
identifier. Cookies are sent to your browser from a website and stored on your computer's
hard drive to facilitate your future access to websites or to enhance data analytics.

Like many sites, we use "cookies" to collect information. You can instruct your browser to
refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, if you do not accept
cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of our Sites.
We may use “retargeting” services to target Fitchburg State University ads to you when you
visit other websites, based on your prior use of our Sites.
We are the sole owner of the information collected on our Sites and Mobile Apps and we will
not sell or rent this information to third parties, unless specifically disclosed.
Location Information
When you use any mapping features of the Mobile App, we may use GPS technology (or other
similar technology) to determine your current location and display a location map. This
provides real-time location data when using the Mobile App but this data is not stored by the
Mobile App.
If you do not want us to use your location for the purposes set forth above, you should turn
off the location services for the Mobile App, however location-based mapping features of the
Mobile App will be unavailable for use.
What We Do with the Information We Gather
We use this information to understand your needs and analyze the services we provide to you.
In particular, for the following reasons:
• To answer a question you have asked;
• To provide you with the information or service you have requested;
• For internal record keeping;
• To improve our services, including performance and functionality of the websites; and
• To periodically send promotional information about University programs, events, or
other information we think you may find interesting, based upon information or usage
data you have provided.
Reasons We May Disclose the Information We Gather
We do not disclose confidential information we collect online to individuals or entities
not affiliated with Fitchburg State, except in the limited circumstances described below.
• We may disclose confidential information pursuant to Fitchburg State policies,
applicable collective bargaining agreements, and/or state or federal law, including, but
not limited to, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”) and the
Massachusetts Public Records Law.
• We may be required to disclose confidential information pursuant to a valid court order
or lawfully issued subpoena, search warrant, or other legal process.
• We may disclose confidential information to law enforcement if we believe that
disclosure is necessary to protect the University, to protect the health or safety of
2183941_1
individuals, or if law enforcement believes that our resources have been used in the
commission of a crime.
•   We may disclose confidential information to third parties and University vendors to
perform services for you or to meet institutional needs.
Note: The above-listed examples are not an exhaustive list.
Security
We are concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information, including the
information we collect online. We do not allow any non-Fitchburg State entity to collect
information from our network unless those entities obtain written permission from us. We
have put in place industry-standard physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect
information we process and maintain.
