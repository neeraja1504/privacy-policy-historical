INFORMATION WE COLLECT
Personal Data
We may collect and process information that identifies you or can be used to identify or contact you, (e.g., your name, e-mail address, business address, phone number or other identifiers (Personal Data). We request Personal Data from you when you register on any of our Properties. In addition to information collected during registration, we may collect Personal Data that you voluntarily provide, for example, in e-mails to our Properties, online order and registration forms and surveys.
You do not have to provide us with any Personal Data to visit our Properties. If you choose to withhold requested information, however, you may not be able to use all of the features of our Properties.
Nonpersonal Data
In addition to Personal Data, we may collect and/or track information that by itself cannot be used to identify or contact you, (e.g., demographic information (like age, profession or gender), domain names, certain IP addresses, computer type, browser types, and other anonymous statistical data involving the use of our Properties (Nonpersonal Data).
We use Nonpersonal Data to help us understand who uses our Properties and to improve and market our Properties.
IP Addresses
In addition to the non Nonpersonal Data highlighted above, we may collect certain information about your computer, including, where available, your IP address or other unique identifiers from your device. This information is collected for system administration (for example to enable identification and log-on for certain services), but also to understand more generally about the way users interact with our services. In certain cases, these IP addresses may amount to Personal Data or, when used in combination with other data which we hold, may enable us to identify you. This statistical information is not shared other than with our Affiliates in order to inform internal planning purposes. Once aggregated, this becomes generic Nonpersonal Data about our users' browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual.
Cookies and other Tracking Tools
We use certain internet technologies such as cookies, action keys and web bugs, among others (collectively, Tracking Tools). Tracking tools are files or tools that are placed on your computer in order to identify your Web browser and the activities of your computer on our Properties. We do not use cookies or Web beacons to collect Personal Data other than certain IP addresses which are treated in accordance with this Policy.
When you visit a Property, we may recognize you by a Tracking Tool and customize your use of that particular Property accordingly (e.g., once you have registered, a cookie will be used to avoid asking you to register again). The information obtained from using these technologies is not sold or otherwise made available to third parties except in accordance with this policy.
The cookies we use are referred to as session or persistent cookies, depending on how long they are used:
Session cookies only last for your online session and disappear from your computer or device when you close your browser.
