Privacy policy | FitClick
Maintaining your privacy is of paramount concern to Genesant Technologies, Inc. ("GTI"), the provider of mobile applications ("Apps") and the owner and operator of the online service (the "Site" and, together with the Apps, the "Service") that provides data to, and stores data from, the Apps. GTI created this Privacy Policy to explain its information collection and use practices and the protection of your information when you visit and use the Service. Any terms capitalized but not otherwise defined herein shall have the respective meanings set forth in the Terms & Conditions.
In this Policy, "we", "us" and "our" collectively refer to GTI.
This Privacy Policy is only applicable to the Service and does not apply to any websites or applications that are owned or operated by third parties ("Third-Party Websites/Applications"), which may have data collection, storage and use practices and policies that differ materially from this Privacy Policy. For additional information, see the section concerning Third-Party Websites/Applications, below.
BY USING THE WEBSITE AND/OR APPLICATIONS, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREE TO THE TERMS OF, THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND OR DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS PRIVACY POLICY, YOU MAY NOT USE THE SERVICE.
Information Collection Practices
Traffic Data
GTI automatically gathers information of the sort that browsers automatically make available, including: (i) IP addresses; (ii) domain servers; (iii) types of computers accessing the Website; and (iv) types of Web browsers accessing the Site (collectively "Traffic Data"). Traffic Data is anonymous information that does not personally identify you.
Cookies
A "cookie" is a string of information that a website stores on a userï¿½s computer, and that the user's browser provides to the website each time the user submits a query to the website. The purpose of a cookie is to identify the user as a unique user of the Site. GTI uses cookies to customize your experience on the Site to your interests, to ensure that you do not see the same advertisements or informational messages repeatedly, and to store your password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit the Site. In addition, GTI may use cookies, and other methods, to store and retrieve data from your web browser. For additional information on GTIï¿½s uses of cookies, see the section concerning Information Use and Disclosure Practices/Traffic Data and Information Gathered Using Cookies, below.
IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO HAVE COOKIES PLACED ON YOUR COMPUTER, YOU SHOULD SET YOUR BROWSERS TO REFUSE COOKIES BEFORE ACCESSING THE SITE, WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT CERTAIN OF THE SERVICES AND CERTAIN FEATURES OF THE SITE MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY WITHOUT THE AID OF COOKIES.
Web Beacons
"Web beacons" (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or web bugs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users or to access cookies. Unlike cookies which are stored on the userï¿½s computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on web pages (or in e-mail). Web beacons may be used to deliver or communicate with cookies, to count users who have visited certain pages and to understand usage patterns. For additional information on GTIï¿½s uses of web beacons, see the section concerning Information Use and Disclosure Practices/Traffic Data and Information Gathered Using Cookies & Web Beacons, below.
Mobile Device Data
When users download, install and use the Apps on their mobile phone or other wireless telecommunications device, GTI automatically gathers information, including without limitation, carrier providers, a unique device identifier, geo-location information (if allowed by the user), the types of mobile devices accessing the Apps, and the types of operating systems accessing the Apps (collectively, "Mobile Device Data"). A unique device identifier is a string of alphanumeric characters (similar to a serial number) used to uniquely identify and distinguish each mobile phone or other wireless communications device. Location services can be enabled or disabled at anytime, through the mobile device settings. GTI uses Mobile Device Data to understand usage patterns and to improve the Apps. For additional information on GTIï¿½s uses of Mobile Device Data, see the section concerning Information Use and Disclosure Practices/Traffic Data and Information Gathered Using Cookies, Web Beacons, and Mobile Device Data, below.

We do not share your non-public Personal Information with these parties, but we may share anonymized or aggregated information with them to improve the relevancy of the ads you see on or through the Service. The collection of this information by third-parties is subject to such third-partiesï¿½ privacy policies.
