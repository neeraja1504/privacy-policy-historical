Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining FISO Limited's online information practices. FISO Limited is the owner of this website, fiso.co.uk.
To contribute to the content on fiso.co.uk (either forum posts or website articles/links) all we require is that when registering you confirm you are 16 or over, you choose a unique username, a personal password and you enter your valid email address so you can collect your account activation code by email. You should not use any personally identifiable information (such as real name) as your username. If later you want your username changing then contact 'admin' on the fiso forum. We do not ask you for your real name or address to participate on fiso.co.uk.
Any information beyond your user name, your password, and your e-mail address during the registration process is optional. You can enter profile information about your forum username via your user control panel. This information (including your email address) can be changed by you at any time. We recommend that you do not enter personally identifiable information within your profile that other fiso registered members can view. You also have the option of what information in your account is publicly displayed. Furthermore, within your account, you have the option to opt-in or opt-out of automatically generated e-mails from the phpBB forum software.
Your password is ciphered (a one-way hash) so that it is secure. However, it is recommended that you do not reuse the same password across a number of different websites. Your password is the means of accessing your account at fiso.co.uk, so please guard it carefully and under no circumstance will anyone affiliated with fiso.co.uk, phpBB or another 3rd party, legitimately ask you for your password. Should you forget your password for your account, you can use the �I forgot my password� feature provided by the phpBB software. This process will ask you to submit your user name and your e-mail, then the phpBB software will generate a new password to reclaim your account.
