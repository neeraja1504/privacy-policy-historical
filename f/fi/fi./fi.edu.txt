Privacy Policy | The Franklin Institute Science Museum
Thank you for visiting The Franklin Institute's website and reviewing our privacy policy. This policy applies only to information collected via the Institute's website.
If you send us personal information—by submitting an e-mail, completing an online form, requesting materials or information, ordering Institute tickets, making a donation, or signing up for membership—we will use this information to respond to your inquiry or request. We may also use it to contact you to provide information about other Institute activities, programs, membership and fundraising opportunities, products, and special events that may interest you. You may opt-out of having your information used by the Institute for these purposes, or you may update your contact information anytime, by contacting us via e-mail or postal mail address.
The Franklin Institute does not sell, exchange, or release website visitor's names, e-mail addresses, or other individually identifying information to parties outside of the Institute, except to third party contractors performing services, to the extent necessary to comply with applicable laws or valid legal processes, to protect the rights and property of the Institute, or to provide the services or information you have requested.
Users should be aware that the Institute contracts with several third-party vendors to provide certain services made available on and to process transactions made through this website. Use of these services is subject to the privacy policies of such third-party vendors (identified below).
The Franklin Institute provides visitors with an opportunity to make a contribution to our organization through an online donation page. When a visitor to the Institute website chooses to make an online donation to the Institute, they are linked to a website served by Blackbaud, Inc. Visitors to the Blackbaud website are subject to Blackbaud's policies and should refer to Blackbaud's policies for the details of that policy. The information that you supply during any of the above transaction processes is used to fulfill your order and will also be used to track and analyze transaction trends.
On some pages of our website, you may notice that we use third-party advertising companies to serve ads. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click here.
The Franklin Institute does not offer refunds on donations or ticket purchases to any Institute fundraising event.
Please note that the Institute may revise its privacy policy at any time. Occasionally, changes in technology, functionality, content we provide, laws and/or Institute policy may require us to revise policies and practices on this page. We encourage you to periodically visit this page to review our most current policy. Your continued use of the site shall constitute your acceptance of any such changes to this policy.
