In the course of conducting our business, we may share any of the information we collect about you with third parties if:
You request or authorize it
The information is provided to help complete a transaction initiated by you
The information is provided to a third party providing services to us, such as data processing, printing services, and marketing service

Furthermore, we may also disclose information about you to other nonaffiliated and affiliated third parties not described in this Notice as permitted by law.
We may share any of the information we collect within our affiliated family of companies in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act. The types of companies within our family of affiliates include insurance agencies, insurance companies, mortgage bankers, broker-dealers, and financial advisors. The Credit Union also provides information to its affiliated credit union service organization, Media Benefits Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Credit Union.

If you do not wish for us to share any of the information amongst our affiliates, you have the right to opt-out of such information-sharing as explained below in the section entitled "Your Right to Opt-Out."
We sometimes share the information we collect about you with outside companies that perform services for us. For example, to maintain and service your accounts or to fulfill your transaction requests, we share information with non-financial companies that provide services to us, such as data processing companies, printing companies, mailing companies, and marketing companies. Prior to sharing any information with such entities, we require them to agree to safeguard our member's and customer's information and to comply with all applicable privacy laws.
In addition, to offer you a wider array of financial products and services, we may enter into joint marketing agreements with other financial institutions such as insurance agencies, insurance companies, mortgage bankers, broker dealers, and financial advisors. We never give these financial institutions your account numbers. Prior to sharing any information with such entities, we require them to agree to safeguard our member's and customer's information and to comply with all applicable privacy laws. However, if you do not wish for us to share any of your information under these joint marketing agreements, you have the right to opt-out of such information-sharing as explained below in the section entitled "Your Right to Opt-Out."

We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to guard your information. We also continually update and assess our systems to improve our technology for protecting information.
