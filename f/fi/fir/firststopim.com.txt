Privacy Policy – First Stop IM – Lewis Turner – Journey To Millions
FirstStopIM (" FirstStopIM ") operates firststopim.com and may operate other websites. It is FirstStopIM policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.
Website Visitors
Like most website operators, FirstStopIM collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. FirstStopIM purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how FirstStopIM visitors use its website. From time to time, FirstStopIM may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
FirstStopIM also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on firststopim.com blogs/sites. FirstStopIM only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog/site where the comment was left.
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to FirstStopIM websites choose to interact with FirstStopIM in ways that require FirstStopIM to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that FirstStopIM gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up at firststopim.com to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with FirstStopIM are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, FirstStopIM collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with FirstStopIM. FirstStopIM does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

FirstStopIM may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. FirstStopIM may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, FirstStopIM does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
