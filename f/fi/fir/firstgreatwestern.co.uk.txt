At a glance this is what you need to know
We always recommend that our customers read this privacy policy in full. It explains who we are, how and why we collect personal data from you, how and why it will be processed by us and our commitment to protecting your data.
But just in case you’re on the move or do not have time to read it in full we have summarised the key points for you in our 'speed read' section below.
Great Western Railway ( GWR , we , our or us ) is a trading name of First Greater Western Limited. We are registered as a data controller with the Information Commissioner's Office and our registration number is Z9382315.
We have appointed a Data Protection Officer. They are responsible for our approach to data protection and protecting your privacy. You can contact them at DPO@firstgroup.com.
We process (i.e. handle) your personal data to provide our services to you. Under data protection laws, we are only permitted to process your personal data where we have a legal basis for doing so. We will only ever process your personal data in compliance with applicable law.
We may share your personal data with our third party suppliers, including payment processors and data analysts, to enable the efficient and secure provision of services to you. Except as explained in this privacy policy, we will not share your data with third parties without your consent unless required to do so by law.
We will keep your personal data for as long as we need it. How long we need your personal data depends on what we are using it for, whether that is to provide services to you, for our own legitimate interests (described below) or so that we can comply with the law. We will actively review the information we hold and when there is no longer a customer, legal or business need for us to hold it, we will either delete it securely or in some cases anonymise it.
We may transfer your personal data to a recipient located outside of the European Economic Area ( EEA ). If we do this, we will ensure that the transfer mechanism provides an adequate level of protection, which has been recognised by the European Commission.
You have important rights under laws aimed at protecting your personal data. This policy sets out your rights and how you can exercise them. For more information, read section 12.

Cookie policy
Last updated: 9 August 2019
This policy explains how our website, mobile app and Wi-Fi portal use cookies.
What is a cookie?
Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your personal computer, mobile or other device when you visit a website.
Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognises that cookie. Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognise a user's device.
Cookies in themselves do not identify you, just the computer or device you are using. Cookies do lots of different jobs, like making it easier for you to log onto, and use, our site during future visits, letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improving your experience. They also allow us to monitor traffic on our site and can also help to ensure that advertising you see online is more relevant to you and your interests.
Cookies themselves only record which areas of our site have been visited by your computer or device and for how long. Allowing us to create a cookie does not give us access to the rest of your computer, and does not allow us to see any personally identifiable data about you.
Types of Cookies
We've arranged the cookies we use into four groups:
a) A nalytics/performance cookies : Every time someone visits our site, software that we have selected and which is provided by one or more other organisations generates an 'anonymous analytics cookie' which tell us whether or not you have visited our site before. Your browser will tell us if you have these cookies and, if you don't, we generate new ones. This allows us to track how many users we have, and how often they visit our site. We use these cookies to gather statistics such as the number of visits to any page on our site.
b)  Functionality cookies : These cookies enable us to remember choices you make and provide enhanced, more personal features. For example, remembering your email address and preferences on our website, so you don't have to choose them each time you visit.
c) Strictly necessary cookies : These are cookies that are required for the operation of our website. They include, for example, cookies that enable you to log into secure areas of our website or make a purchase.
d) Targeting cookies : We use these anonymous cookies to determine the content of advertisements that we show on other websites. When you visit other sites on the web, such as news or information sites, this cookie lets our re-targeting providers know when to serve advertisements and what content to show you. These cookies also allow us to know whether or not you've seen an advertisement, and how long it has been since you've seen it.
Cookies we use
You can find more information about the individual cookies we use and the purposes for which we use them in the table below:
Cookies and similar technologies set by third parties
On some pages of our site other organisations, for example Facebook and other social networks, may also set their own cookies or use other similar technologies (e.g. web beacons, pixels and local storage technologies) to collect or receive information from our website or elsewhere on the internet and use that information to provide measurement services and target ads. Because of how these technologies work, our site cannot access this information. These third parties are responsible for setting out their own cookie and privacy policies.

Facebook also provide certain features (e.g. pixels, SDKs and APIs) which are known as Facebook tools. We may use these Facebook tools to optimise our communication and improve targeted communications through Facebook, Instagram and the Facebook Audience Network.
Google provide advertising services through Google’s advertising and marketing platforms (e.g., DoubleClick for Publishers, Google AdX, and Adwords). AdWords remarketing cookies allow us to target our advertising across Google search and other websites to people that have previously visited this website.
Google also uses various conversion cookies to help advertisers determine how many times people who click on their ads end up purchasing their products. These cookies allow Google and the advertiser to tell that you clicked the ad and later visited the advertiser site.
