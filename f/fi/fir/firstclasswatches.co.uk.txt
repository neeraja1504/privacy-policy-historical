We know how important it is that your data is stored, accessed and transferred securely. We treat all your data with extreme care and take appropriate action to ensure it is protected.
When you browse our website, make an order online with us or over the telephone, we use encryption technology (also known as HTTPS, TLS or SSL) to ensure that nobody else can access this data while it is in transit. This also prevents unauthorised third parties from accessing your browsing history or tampering with the web pages we send back to your computer or device.

Whenever we collect or process your personal data, we’ll only keep it for as long as necessary in relation to the reason it was collected. After this time, your personal data will either be completely deleted or anonymised so that it cannot be related to you individually.

Examples of our data retention periods:

How do you manage cookies set by our websites?
Cookies are tiny text files stored on your computer when you visit certain web pages, which we use to keep track of what you have in your basket, and to remember you when you return to our site.
Please note that cookies can't harm your computer, and they do not contain any sensitive information such as payment details, but we do use them to remember your device between visits and allow you to complete purchases on our website.
If you don't wish to enable cookies, you'll still be able to browse the site and use it for research purposes. Most web browsers have cookies enabled, but you can disable these in your web browser setting for certain or all websites should you need to.
For iOS Safari you can do this in the “Settings app” on your home screen. Select “Safari” from the menu and under “Privacy and Security” tap on the “Block Cookies” section.
For Chrome Mobile and some Android devices, you can do this by opening your web browser and clicking on the menu (represented by three dots). Choose “Settings” and then choose “Site settings” you can then click “All Sites” to change settings for a specific site or “Cookies” to change settings for all sites.
For Chrome Desktop, you can change individual site settings by browsing to the website in question and clicking the area to the left of the “address bar”. This normally shows “Secure” or our company name while visiting our website. You can then click “Cookies” and block or allow individual cookies.
For other devices and browsers please consult the relevant help files.
Please note that if you choose to block certain cookies, you may find that certain functionality will not work on our website. To use these portions of our website you may need to re-enable the relevant cookies. You can always contact us by telephone or in-store to place an order, if you prefer.
We do have relationships with carefully-selected and monitored suppliers who may also set cookies during your visit to be used for remarketing purposes - in other words to show you different products and services based on what you appear to be interested in. If you wish to opt-out of this personalised advertising, please see the section above this one.
Do not track (DNT) is a feature offered by some browsers, with some newer browsers offering it as default. If you enable it, it sends a signal to websites to request that your browsing isn't tracked, for example by third party ad or social networks, or analytic companies. You can opt out of tracking and analytics on this website by changing your settings in the Managing Cookies section on this page.
At present no industry-wide uniform standard has been agreed and adopted to determine how DNT requests should be managed, so our website doesn’t currently respond to DNT requests. Until that standard is established, we'll continue to review DNT and other new technologies, but won't respond to DNT requests.
