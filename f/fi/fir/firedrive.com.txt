Privacy Policy | Firedrive
Your privacy is important to Firedrive Media Limited (“Firedrive”), so we have developed a Privacy Policy that covers how we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store your information. This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time to reflect our ongoing commitment to the development of new products and services, as well as changes to applicable laws and regulations. Please take time to review our Privacy Policy below and understand how our policies affect you, your personal information and your content.
Firedrive collects personally identifiable information such as your name, name of your business, e-mail address, web site address or URL, home or work address and telephone number. Any and all of this information may also be combined with other information to provide and improve our products, services, content, and advertising.
As well, Firedrive will also collect financial information including credit card information, email address, billing address, purchases details. Firedrive will submit the information that pertains to payment processing to our payment-processing partners via encrypted communication for verification. Our payment-processing partner keeps the credit card number after processing that allows them to maintain error and transaction logs that make it possible to synchronize credit card information with customer names. Our payment processing partner does not share or sell this information.  It is your responsibility to review the Privacy Policy of our payment-processing partner to understand how your personal information is collected and use.
From time to time, Firedrive may use your personal information to send important notices, such as communications about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. Firedrive may also use personal information for internal purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and research to improve Firedrive’s products, services, and customer communications.
Firedrive may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose. For instance, Firedrive may collect information such as occupation, language, zip code, area code, unique device identifier, location, and the time zone of the user so that we can better understand customer behavior and improve our products, services, and advertising.
Firedrive may also collect information regarding customer activities on our website and other products and services websites advertised on Firedrive.com. This information may be aggregated and used to help us provide more useful information to our customers and to understand which parts of our website, products, and services are of most interest. Aggregated data is considered non-personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy. If we do combine non-personal information with personal information the combined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined.
When you sign-up for Firedrive services, we may ask you for personal identifying information including a user name and password.
