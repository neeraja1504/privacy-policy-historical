Effective Date: 1/15/2019
Armor Defense Inc., (“Armor” or “we” or “us” or “our”) is committed to protecting the privacy of its customers (“customers” or “you”).  This Privacy Statement describes how we collect, utilize, distribute and protect personally identifiable information you provide to us through our website: www.armor.com and our service platform. It also describes the choices available to you regarding Armor’s use of your personally identifying information and the steps you can take to access, update and correct your personal information. The use of information collected through our service shall be limited to the purpose of providing the service for which the Client has engaged Armor.
For the purposes of this Privacy Statement, “customer” shall mean any past, present, or prospective user of Armor’s products or services, including any users of the Armor Website (the “Site”).
EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield
Armor has offices in the United States and the United Kingdom.  Therefore, it is possible that your information may be available to these offices.  To ensure adequate protection of the transfer of your personal information to these jurisdictions, Armor participates in and has certified its compliance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework.  We are committed to subjecting all personal information received from European Union (EU) member countries and Switzerland to the Framework’s applicable Principles. Armor is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.  To learn more about the Privacy Shield Frameworks, and to view our certification, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield List. [ https://www.privacyshield.gov ]
Armor is responsible for the processing of personal information it receives under the Privacy Shield Framework, and may subsequently provide personal information to third parties to perform services on our behalf.  Armor complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions.  That is, if we transfer personal information received under the Privacy Shield to a third party, Armor will obtain assurances from the third party that they will safeguard personal information in a manner consistent with our obligations under the Privacy Shield. We will remain responsible under the Privacy Shield for any failure to do so by the third party, unless we prove we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
Armor ’s adherence to the Privacy Shield may be limited in circumstances where Armor may be required to disclose personal information such as in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security, public interest or law enforcement requirements, or as required by statute, government regulation, or court order.
If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third-party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at  https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request.
Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website [ https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint ], you may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.

Automatic Information:  Armor may collect and store certain information about your visits and interactions with our site that does not directly identify you, but is automatically received and recorded by us through use of “cookies.” We use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user-base. You can control the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings in your browser.

We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you.  We do this to improve services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or site functionality.
For information Collected through our Service Platform: Armor collects information under the direction of its Clients, and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal information it processes. If you are a customer of one of our Clients and would no longer like to be contacted by one of our Clients that use our service, please contact the Client that you interact with directly. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct his query to the Armor’s Client (the data controller). If requested to remove data we will respond within a reasonable timeframe.
We may transfer personal information to companies that help us provide our service. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our Clients.

Although reasonable efforts are made to secure network communications and the Site, Armor cannot guarantee that the information submitted to, maintained on, or transmitted from our systems will be completely secure.  Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
