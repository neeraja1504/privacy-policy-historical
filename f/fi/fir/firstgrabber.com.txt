Information We Collect
Our purpose in collecting information from you is to help us provide you with better service, such as notifications about special offers and promotions. We will not willfully disclose any personally identifiable information about you to any third party without first receiving your permission, as explained in this Privacy Statement. Furthermore, we do not specifically target children under the age of 13, nor do we knowingly collect, without parental consent, personally identifiable information from such children.
If you are applying for an account with FirstGrabber, we may require that you provide us with certain personal information (such as name, email address, billing information, etc.) relevant to our provision of the various services offered on the Site. We do not collect any personal information other than that which is specifically and knowingly provided to us by you. When we request information, we shall explain how it may be used and give you an opportunity to request that the information not be used for those purposes. We shall also give you an opportunity to opt out of future communications from us.
Cookies
FirstGrabber may, at times, use cookies. Cookies are data files stored on your computer that identify you as a unique user. Cookies enable us to track user trends, preferences and patterns to better understand our user base and to improve the quality of our service. Most browsers permit users to refuse cookies or to be notified before a cookie is accepted. You can visit our site without using cookies.
Third Party Cookies
FirstGrabber may, at times, drop third party web beacons. Opting out of third parties' services will prevent them from collecting data when a user visits any of FirstGrabber's partner/customer sites. By doing so, advertisements will no longer be tailored to your interests.
Note that after choosing to opt out, if you use a different computer or a different browser, or if you delete or block browser cookies, you may need to repeat the opt-out steps. Most web browsers also enable you to block browser cookies. You can refer to your web browser's documentation to get more information on how to block or delete cookies directly through your browser settings.

The Site contains links to other websites. Those websites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information. FirstGrabber is in no way responsible or liable for the privacy practices or content of such third party websites. This Statement applies only to our own services and our Site, and does not apply to any other third party services or websites. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy statement of any website you visit.
Sharing Information
FirstGrabber may share non-personal and non-personally identifiable information about our users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties. FirstGrabber may partner with other parties in connection with the various services offered on the Site. In such instances, we may share limited personal information that is necessary for the third-party to provide its services. These companies are prohibited from using this information for any other purpose. FirstGrabber may also provide personal information when disclosure may be required by law (e.g., subpoenas, search warrants and court orders). We may also determine that such action is reasonably necessary to protect a party's rights, property, or well-being. This action may include exchanging information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud detection or protection, or in other situations involving suspicious or illegal activities.
