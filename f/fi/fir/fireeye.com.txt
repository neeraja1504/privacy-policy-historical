You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. This site provides instructions for adjusting cookie preferences for common browsers:

Data Storage and Security
Account Information
When you submit information to FireEye, a temporary copy of that information is routinely made to prevent accidental loss of your information through a computer malfunction or human error.
Please note that any information that we have copied may remain in back-up storage for some period of time after your deletion request. This may be the case even though no information about your account remains in our active user databases.
FireEye does not react to Do Not Track signals because there is no standard for how those signals are sent.
Servers
The FireEye computers (called "servers") that send your Web pages process and store an enormous amount of information every day. These computer records are called "log files."
Log files are used for analysis, research, auditing, and other purposes, as described above. After this information has been used, it is stored and is inaccessible. Until the information is stored, your FireEye ID may remain in our active server log files.
Security
Appropriate technical and physical safeguard measures are in place to protect against unauthorized or unlawful access, misuse, accidental loss, destruction and alternation of any Personal Information which are shared with us in the course of using our website services.
