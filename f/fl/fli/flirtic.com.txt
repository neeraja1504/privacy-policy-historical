Who we are
Flirtic is operated by Flirtic Inc., a company registered in Delaware, USA (ALEXANDRIA, 901 N. PITT STREET, SUITE 325).
Age Restrictions

Personally Identifying Information Provided to and Collected by Flirtic
Any information a user shares using Flirtic's services about himself or herself will be deemed a voluntary disclosure of personal information. Personally identifiable information that our site will collect and store may include: age, general geographic location, aim of acquaintance, your education, religion, your native language, smoking habits and information about children. Furthermore, Flirtic will allow a user to voluntarily provide additional personal information, such as, but not limited to: interests, favorite activities, ideal get-togethers.
Users will also have the option of permitting Flirtic to collect, store, and post your personal information shared on other social networking services. Flirtic will not collect, store, or post this information unless a user has expressly opted-in to this service by agreeing to the “allow access” verification upon signup or by choosing to opt-in to the service post signup. However, Flirtic will not reciprocate – we will not share your information collected via our services or our opted-in access to your other social networking services with those services you have granted us access to.
You never have to answer any questions, and you can decline this exchange of information at any time. However, if you should choose to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with some of the services dependent upon the collection of this information. Depending upon the activity, some of the information that we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity. Flirtic will inform you of the mandatory and/or optional character of the requested and/or required information.
As a registered user you have the right to access and change your personal information and privacy preferences at any time by logging into your personal account, where you can view and make changes to your personal information.
Flirtic's Disclosures of Your Information
Aside from the few narrow exceptions directly addressed in this Privacy Policy, the personal information that you share via Flirtic services will be accessible to everyone visiting your Flirtic profile, including users visiting our website as non-registered members.
Flirtic reserves the right to disclose certain information in the files we maintain about you, and the other information we obtain from your current and past activities at Flirtic, to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our Terms of Service. At times, we may review the data of multiple members to identify problems or resolve disputes. Flirtic is committed to cooperating with law enforcement inquiries, as well as other third parties, to enforce laws, such as: intellectual property rights, fraud and other rights.
By accepting our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service, you authorize us to disclose any information about you to law enforcement and other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in connection with any investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose you or us to legal liability.
Flirtic reserves the right to use your personally identifiable information for internal research, such as to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to analyze Flirtic services usage, improve our content and product offerings, and customize our services. However, Flirtic does not sell your information to advertisers or other similar third parties for their commercial use.
In the event that all or substantially all of Flirtic's stock and/or all or substantially all assets are transferred or sold to another entity, Flirtic may transfer personally identifiable information to the acquiring entity. If, as a result of such a business transition, your personally identifiable information will be used in a materially different manner, you will be given choice consistent with our policy regarding notification of changes. When you submit personal information to Flirtic, you understand and agree that this information may be transferred across national boundaries and may be stored and processed in any of the countries in which Flirtic and its affiliates and subsidiaries maintain offices. You also acknowledge that in certain countries or with respect to certain activities, the collection, transferring, storage, and processing of your information may be undertaken by trusted vendors of Flirtic. Such vendors are bound by contract not to use your personal information for their own purposes or provide it to any third parties.
Flirtic services may be subject to the laws of various jurisdictions, because access to Flirtic services may use internet traffic of different jurisdictions, including European Union countries or United States of America. Flirtic will disclose personally identifiable information without your permission when required by law, or in good faith belief that such action is necessary to investigate or protect against harmful activities to Flirtic guests, visitors, associates, or property, or to others. Laws related to personal identifiable information vary by country.
For example, personally identifiable information collected in the European Union and its Member States is subject to the EU Directives concerning personal data, privacy and electronic communications, including but not limited to Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector and Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data and the subsequent legislation adopted in the EU Member States. Another example, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) was passed by the U.S. Congress in November 1998. COPPA provides parents with specific rights regarding their children's privacy. For additional information and resources on COPPA, please visit the Federal Trade Commission website at http://www.ftc.gov/. Any products or services provided by Flirtic are not directed at children under 13 years of age and, therefore, COPPA does not apply directly. However, we recognize that children under the age of 13 may access our services without Flirtic's consent. The collection of this information is covered above. Parents or Legal Guardians may request from us to review, delete or stop the collection of the personally identifiable information of their child. You may do so emailing us at support@flirtic.com. Flirtic may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide personally identifiable information to appropriate governmental authorities. If requested by law enforcement or judicial authorities, we will provide this information upon receipt of the appropriate documentation. Flirtic may also provide information to law enforcement to protect its property and the health and safety of individuals as permitted by statute.

Opt-Out
To deactivate their profile from our database, users may sign in and deactivate their profile. These options are available from “Account Settings” page. If you want to stop using your account, you have two options. You can temporarily deactivate your account and you can remove your account completely. Removing your account means that no user will be able to search for you on Flirtic, although they may still see you profile from direct cached links. Your deactivated account will be completely deleted within 48 hours. Many users want to deactivate their accounts for temporary reasons and in doing so expect us to maintain their information until they return to Flirtic. You can temporarily close your account for 90 days, after that period your account will be reinstalled again and you will be notified about that by e-mail. To prevent abuse and/or misuse of Flirtic by a user following termination or deletion of a profile/account we shall retain such information as we deem in our sole discretion may be necessary to ensure that user does not open a new account and profile in breach of our Terms of Service and to ensure compliance with all laws and regulations.

We cannot control these activities, and therefore do not accept any responsibility for such exchange of information. If you have given third party applications or websites access to your personal information they may retain such information to the extent permitted under their terms of service or privacy policies.
