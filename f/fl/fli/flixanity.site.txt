FliXanity Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect about you at flixanity.site (the "Website") and FliXanity applications and how we use this information.
Collection of your FliXanity Information
Your "FliXanity information" includes relevant technical information gathered or received while you use FliXanity. This technical information that may be collected or received includes: the type of browser you are using (e.g., Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Safari), the type of operating system you are using (e.g., Windows or Mac OS), your CPU type, the manner in which you connect to the internet (e.g., connection speed through narrowband or broadband access); Internet protocol address; pertinent Applications Installed; information about the version of service from an affiliate that you used prior to registering with the service; certain information about your geographic location; and the domain name of your Internet service provider.
You may not be required to register for a "FliXanity account" for certain Services; however, there are some optional services available (for example, saving a video list) that require an "account". Registration functionality for FliXanity is provided by the FliXanity Network. If you choose to "Register an Account", you will need to register with and provide information to FliXanity. After registering you will obtain a Screen Name, or possibly other credential, issued by FliXanity (collectively, "Screen Name") in order to access and use these optional services. Your Screen Name and associated services account will then be subject to the FliXanity Terms of Service Agreement and Privacy Policies indicated in the registration process and available to view at any time on flixanity.site.
How Your FliXanity information is Used
Your FliXanity information is used
•to operate and improve the websites, services and offerings available through FliXanity;
•to personalize the content provided to you;
•to fulfill your requests for products, programs, and services;
•to communicate with you and respond to your inquiries;
•to conduct research about your use of FliXanity; and
•to help offer you other products, programs, or services that may be of interest.
Your FliXanity information will not be shared with third parties unless it is necessary to fulfill a request, in other circumstances in which you have consented to the sharing of your FliXanity information, or except as described in this Privacy Policy. We may use your FliXanity information to present offers to you on behalf of business partners and advertisers. These business partners and advertisers may receive aggregate data about groups of FliXanity users, but do not receive information that personally identifies you.
If you use our communications tools to disclose information about yourself publicly (for example, by making your screen name and/or video lists publicly available), other online users may obtain access to any information you provide. The contents of your online communications, as well as other information about you as a FliXanity user, may be accessed and disclosed in response to legal process (for example, a court order, search warrant or subpoena); in other circumstances in which we believe FliXanity is being used in the commission of a crime; when we have a good faith belief that there is an emergency that poses a threat to the safety of you or another person; or when necessary either to protect our rights or property or the rights or property of our affiliated providers, or for us to render the service you have requested. We may use agents and contractors in order to help operate the service. If such agents and contractors have access to your FliXanity information, they are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy by, for example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for FliXanity.
In the event that ownership of us or the FliXanity service was to change as a result of a merger, acquisition or transfer to another company, your FliXanity information may be transferred. If such a transfer results in a material change in the use of your FliXanity information, we will provide notice about the choices you have to decline to permit such a transfer.
Your Choices About Your Information
If you want to change your account information (for example, your Screen Name) you will need to log onto FliXanity and access your account through the forum. Your access to your account information and choice will be governed by the FliXanity policies.
