8. Facebook Social Plugins
This website uses Social Plugins ("Plugins") provided by the social network facebook.com, operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Avenue, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA (“Facebook”). The plugins can be identified by the Facebook logos (white "f" on a blue background or a "thumbs up" icon) or the extension “Facebook Social Plugin” (http://developers.facebook.com/plugins).
When a user visits a page of website that contains a social plugin, the browser establishes a direct connection to Facebook servers. Facebook directly transfers the plugin content to your browser which embeds the latter into the website. We accordingly have no influence over the scope of the data that Facebook acquires using this plugin and therefore draw your attention to the information we have available in this respect (http://www.facebook.com/help/?faq=17512).
The embedded plugins let Facebook know that you have accessed the corresponding page of our website. If you are logged into Facebook, your visit can be assigned to your Facebook account. If you interact with the plugins, for example by clicking “Like”, or entering a comment, your browser will send the corresponding information directly to Facebook, at which point it will be saved. If you are not a member of Facebook, Facebook may still acquire and store your IP address. Facebook ensures that, in Germany, the IP address will only be stored anonymously.
For the information on the purpose and scope of data collection and handling by Facebook, as well as your rights in this respect and configuration options regarding the protection of your personal sphere, please visit Facebook's data use policy (http://www.facebook.com/policy.php).
If you are a Facebook member and do not want Facebook to collect data concerning your visit to our website and do not want this linked to your Facebook membership data, please log out of Facebook before visiting our website.
You can also block Facebook Social Plugins by using add-ons for your browser, such as “Facebook Blocker” (http://webgraph.com/resources/facebookblocker).

This website uses the service functions for Twitter (https://twitter.com/about/resources/buttons). These functions are provided by Twitter, Inc., 795 Folsom St., Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA, and can be identified by terms such as “Twitter” or “Tweet” combined with a stylized blue bird. A Twitter button enables you to either share a posting or page of this website on Twitter or to follow us on Twitter.
When a user visits a page of website that contains this plugin, the browser establishes a direct connection to Twitter servers. Twitter directly transfers the Twitter button contents to your browser. Thus, we have no influence on the data acquired by Twitter using the plugin and therefore draw your attention to the information we have available in this respect. According to Twitter, only the user's IP address and the URL of the relevant website in connection with the button are transmitted and only used for the purposes represented by the button. For further information, please follow this link to Twitter's privacy policy (http://twitter.com/privacy).
