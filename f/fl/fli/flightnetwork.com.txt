At the time of flight departure AirHelp+ is provided with your airline booking ID number, the number of passengers travelling, your itinerary details and the email address provided at the time of booking.

We advise you to print these before travelling as some airlines may charge a fee to print them at the airport. You’ve agreed that you will NOT travel with any dangerous goods in your carry-on or on you. This applies to all passengers on the booking.

* Baggage Terms
Baggage Allowance and Restrictions
Baggage fees are not included in the cost of your ticket unless permitted by the airline. Baggage allowance varies from airline to airline and can also vary based on the class of service purchased (I.e. not all economy class tickets offer free baggage allowance). Some airlines charge additional fees for both; check-in and carry-on baggage. Some airlines charge additional fees for adding baggage to the reservation at the airport or after you’ve completed your purchase online. We strongly suggest that baggage is added in advance for such carriers. Moreover; it is the passengers responsibility to check any baggage rules with the airline before making a purchase on our website as Flight Network has zero control over the airline’s ever-changing baggage policies. If you are not sure about a baggage policy, please contact Flight Network prior to booking in order to verify the specific airlines details. Flight Network charges a nominal service charge to add baggage to your booking, you will be notified of the amount at time of purchase. During the booking process, we will only display Economy, Premium Economy, Business or First Class of service types. Many airlines offer branded fare options within these four classes of service (For example: Basic Economy or Flex Economy). We may display a fare as Economy Class even though it is Basic Economy. Since our website is not able to accommodate these branded fare types, we will only list the main classes of service during the purchase process. If you are unsure of the branded fare type within your class of service, please contact us prior to completing your booking so that we can validate the full baggage terms for you. There is a rare chance that your ticket may involve two carriers that do not have ticketing agreements with one another. This means that your baggage will not be checked through to your final destination. In such cases, you will need to collect your baggage and recheck in and this may result in additional baggage charges. Please verify the minimum connection time and baggage information with the airlines directly before your departure. Airlines that do not have ticketing agreements are usually labeled on the Flight Network website as ‘Self-Transfer’ fares. Any baggage purchased at the time of booking is 100% non-refundable. Get the most up-to-date baggage information here.
* Baggage Loss Protection Terms
Baggage Loss Protection:
In the event that the airline loses your baggage, this program covers the amount disclosed during the checkout process (per passenger) in addition to any compensation received from the airline or private insurance company. Baggage Loss Protection is not an insurance product.
* Best Purchase Guarantee Terms
Best Purchase Guarantee Terms:
Purchasing Best Purchase Guarantee Protection allows you to cancel your booking on the same day it was made, without any cancellation fees, up until 11:59PM EST (Ontario, Canada Time).

The fee is for single entry of individuals between the ages of 14 and 79. The payment can only be made in Colombian Pesos, US Dollars or via credit card. The fee does not guarantee entry to Colombia and won’t be reimbursed.
* Changes (Cancellation, Name, Schedule) Terms
Fares:
Most fares are discounted fares which may have cancellation and change penalties. Many of our fares may allow changes by collecting applicable penalties and a fare difference. Most fares can be canceled for a refund or a future time limited travel credit by collecting the applicable penalties and fare differences. All cancellations must be made prior to the scheduled departure time of the first flight segment. Airport fees, where applicable, are not included and are subject to change without prior notice. All prices are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise stated. All prices displayed on our website are subject to change prior to ticket issuance. Increased change in pricing quoted at time of booking to time of ticket issuance shall entitle the customer to cancel the booking and obtain a full refund.
Airline Schedule Changes:
If FlightNetwork® is aware of a change; every effort will be made to advise you directly. Please ensure you contact your airline at least 24-48 hours prior to departure and to be safe, again on the day of departure. It will be your responsibility to reconfirm all your flight details before departure. If there has been a last minute change by your Airline directly (within 48 hours) it is no longer the responsibility of Flight Network to notify you, it is the responsibility of your operating Airline. This is mandated under TICO (The Travel Industry Council of Ontario) and why it is also suggested to reconfirm flights prior to departure. You should always be at the airport 3 hours prior to departure to ensure that you arrive on time for check-in and not miss your flight. All affected schedule changes imposed by the Airlines will be notified by email. Any minor changes less than 30 minutes or with flight number changes will be automatically accepted on your behalf. Any changes 30 minutes to three hours prior or later from the original departure time(if it conflicts with another confirmed ticket itinerary schedule); passengers will be given an option to modify the flight times within 5 days of receiving the schedule change by email. This modification must be with the same carrier, in the same cabin for first available flight. These modifications can only be performed within the airline’s schedule change rebooking guidelines and cannot be guaranteed. Any voluntary changes are subject to the carrier’s normal change or cancellation penalties. If not acknowledged within 5 days from the receipt of the email communication, Flight Network will accept it on behalf of the passengers. We cannot guarantee that the airline will allow modification after the ticket has been reissued or revalidated by the airline. Any major schedule changes beyond three hours from the original departure times; we will send an email notification followed by a phone call to review the affected schedule change. Schedule changes delayed or advanced by 24 hours or more are subject to the next available flight or a full refund. We will not be responsible if the customer fails to enter the correct email and/or phone information at time of reservation. All schedule changes are mandated by airlines directly. Airlines reserve the right to change, cancel or refund based on adjustments to their flight schedules. Flight Network assumes no responsibility for airline schedule changes, however we will do our best to provide alternate travel options if available.
Package/Charter Schedule Changes:
The Airline reserves the right to change flight times within the same day and to include a stop in the flight, not part of the original itinerary with no option for cancellation or compensation. Please read information below regarding the procedure for ANY CHARTER AIRLINE FLIGHT SCHEDULE CHANGE. Any flight that departs: 0-59 minutes earlier, no notification will be provided, please check with your local airport. If FlightNetwork® is aware of a change; every effort will be made to advise you directly. Please ensure you contact your airline at least 24 hours prior to departure and on the day of departure, it will be your responsibility to reconfirm all your flight details before departure. You should always be at the airport 3 hours prior to departure to ensure that you arrive on time for check-in and not miss your flight. No refund is made for unused travel services or any portion thereof, nor is the price or value of unused travel services exchangeable for alternative arrangements. Changes to the current booking are subject to the TERMS AND CONDITIONS as per the TOUR OPERATOR/AIRLINE and as stipulated in the brochure or Airline websites. You are encouraged to purchase the appropriate travel coverage. All purchases, once confirmed are 100% Non-Refundable/Non-Changeable.
Cancellation / Changes:
If you need to change or cancel your travel plans, it is your responsibility to notify us immediately by phone of such a request however, please note that the vast majority of our tickets are automatically issued at the time that the reservation is made and are non-refundable. Often times, once a ticket is issued there are certain airlines that will not allow changes or cancellations, and for others, fees from both the airline as well as Flight Network will apply. You should assume all reservations are non-refundable and non-changeable the moment you make the booking. In addition to any change penalties, you will also be responsible for any difference in price for the new dates selected. Furthermore, each ticket has a minimum and maximum stay validity. Minimum stays can range from 2 nights to 14 nights and maximum stays can range from 30 days to 12 months, depending on the type of ticket sold. Changes will not be permitted where the length of the ticket is less than the minimum stay or more than the maximum stay period allotted. Partially used tickets become 100% non-refundable even if only one segment of the ticket is used. Tickets can also not be used out of sequence, meaning that if you miss your first flight you can not catch your second flight. If the first flight is missed, you will forfeit the entire ticket with no option for a refund. As the intermediary, Flight Network is bound to each Airline’s Terms and Conditions and have zero control over their advertised or contracted fare rules.
Security Verification:
When changes or cancellations are requested by a passenger, Flight Network will confirm 2-3 steps to verification which could include: confirming booking confirmation numbers, email addresses, home address, telephone number, credit card on file and/or passenger names. If these steps to verification have been successfully answered by the passenger requesting the change or cancellation, Flight Network will complete the request for the passenger.
Name Changes / Corrections:
If the tickets have been issued‚ please note name changes and corrections are not permitted. Once the tickets have been issued and if permitted by the airline‚ an additional fee will be assessed by FlightNetwork® and the airline directly. Customers who do not appear or ‘no show’ for their flight will forfeit the entire fare paid. If you arrive at the airport late or are denied boarding you will forfeit the entire fare paid.
* Check-In Terms
Check-in / Boarding times:
We recommend that passengers allow plenty of time to check-in and obtain their boarding pass for their scheduled flight. FlightNetwork® will not be responsible for those passengers who check-in past the airline cut off times. Failure to meet check-in times may result in denied boarding, the loss of your assigned seat selection, cancellation of your full booking and the entire fare paid being forfeited with no option of re booking. Please reconfirm check-in cut off times with the airline directly as the suggested timings are guidelines only and are subject to change without notice.
Suggested Check in times :
Domestic flights: 90 minutes prior to departure Transborder flights: 120 minutes prior to departure International flights: 180 minutes prior to departure
* Children and travel (entry/exit to South Africa)
As of October 1, 2014, parents travelling with children will be asked to produce the child’s unabridged (long form) birth certificate and a consent letter (if the child is travelling with only one parent). Other requirements may apply to unaccompanied children. Contact the High Commission of South Africa before travelling. Please consult the Government of Canada here for more information.
* Confirmation Terms
Confirmation:
In some circumstances, your booking will provide you with a confirmation number before a ticket has been issued. The booking process is not complete and the fare is subject to change until a ticket is issued. FlightNetwork® is not accountable for any bookings that could not be processed due to inaccurate and/or incomplete credit card verification information, or due to other technical malfunction with internal or external pricing or booking systems, including errors by the airline or the airline reservations system, you will be notified by email of such issue(s).
Flight Reconfirmation:
Outbound and return flights must be reconfirmed with the relevant airlines 24 hours prior to the commencement of that leg of the journey unless specifically informed otherwise by that airline. We accept no responsibility for bookings cancelled due to non-compliance with rules set by that particular airline. We also take no responsibility for any flight rescheduling en route.
* Credit Card Terms
Credit Card:
You agree to authorize the ticket issuer to charge your credit card number the amount that is shown as the Grand Total.
Appearance of charges on credit cards/Visa Debits:
The amount displayed for an ‘Authorized Transaction’ may be different from what you actually paid, as some merchants require a temporary hold be placed on additional funds. This is a common practice for many other merchants such as: gas stations, restaurants and hotels. The correct amount will display when the transaction is shown as a ‘Posted Transaction’. A delay may occur between the time a transaction is settled and removed from Authorized Transactions, and when it appears in Posted Transactions. Some transactions may appear as both an Authorized and a Posted Transaction until settled. When applying a debit/visa card for payment, and in the event of a cancellation, your funds may be held up to 60days by your financial institution. We strongly recommend an alternative form of payment to avoid any inconveniences. If you are using a foreign or a third party credit card to make your booking, our Back Office Processing Department may contact you by email or telephone to collect more information. Since Flight Network is a Canadian company, passengers using foreign credit cards may be charged a foreign transaction fee and/or currency conversion fee from their financial institute. Also note, this foreign transaction fee and/or currency conversion fee can apply to Canadian credit card holders, if the booking is made with one of our suppliers based in the US or Europe. We do not take any responsibility for foreign transaction fee and/or currency conversion fee. Flight Network is a Canadian website that deals with many international vendors. When we display a vendor booking, using another currency, our website will show the equivalent to Canadian dollar amount. The final amount that settles on your account will depend on the exchange rate that your credit card company is using. In addition, Flight Network does not have any control over the foreign transaction fees charged by certain credit card companies.
* Fees
OB Ticketing Fees
The Airline ticketing fees, also called OB Fees, are defined and collected by the validating Carrier and charged to the passenger when a ticket is issued in Australia (at first ticket issuance only). These fees can be imposed to cover charges for a specific Form of Payment (credit card) or for other ticketing services. Airline ticketing fees are non-refundable and are collected at time of ticket issuance automatically depending on the itinerary booked. You will see this as a separate additional charge on your statement which can not be determined in advance. As a result, we are unable to notify you the exact amount at time of purchase.
Flight Network Booking Fees
Flight Network will often times charge a booking fee on flights to a particular destination. This fee is lumped into the total cost of your booking. By agreeing to the total purchase price of the ticket, you have also agreed to the Flight Network booking fee. This fee is charged by Flight Network (not the airline) in CAD or USD depending on your booking currency.
* Flexible Tickets
Flight Network’s Flexible Ticket provides customers with the option to change the date on their ticket. The Flexible ticket option can only be added and paid for at the time of booking, and cannot be added after. The Flexible ticket product once purchased, starts from the time that the booking is made up until 48 hours before flight departure. Any changes within 48 hours of the flight are not covered under this option. The Flexible ticket option is per person and will only provide coverage for the person holding the ticket. Flexible tickets cannot be purchased for Infant tickets – Infants are exempt from participating in this booking add-on. The Flexible Ticket option covers the service provider and airlines change fees. If the new date requested has no availability in the same class of service which the original ticket was booked on, the difference in fare will be at the travellers own expense. See Full Terms & Conditions
* Hotels Terms
Hotels:
Flightnetwork.com does not collect taxes for remittance to applicable taxing authorities. The tax recovery charges on prepaid hotel transactions are a recovery of the estimated transaction taxes (e.g. sales and use‚ occupancy‚ room tax‚ excise tax‚ value added tax‚ etc) that Flightnetwork.com pays to the hotel supplier in connection with your hotel reservation. The Hotel suppliers remit applicable taxes to the applicable taxing jurisdictions. Flightnetwork.com does not act as a co-vendor with the supplier with whom we reserve your travel arrangements. Taxability and the appropriate tax rates vary greatly by location. The actual tax amounts paid to the hotel suppliers may vary from the tax recovery charge amounts‚ depending upon the rates‚ taxability‚ etc. in effect at the time of actual use of the hotel by our customers.
* Insurance Terms
Insurance:
We strongly recommend travel insurance to cover you for cancellation, health, baggage and other losses including out-of-province health insurance, if applicable. For every sale, Flight Network offers the option to purchase travel insurance to cover the customer against any unforeseen circumstances that may occur prior to, during or after your trip. There are different types of insurance policies available and the purchase of insurance is an optional decision to the customer. Insurance policies purchased on FlightNetwork.com will insure passengers up to the sum of $100, $600 or $800 prior to departure, depending on the airline and journey type where applicable. It is the customers’ responsibility to read and familiarize themselves with the travel insurance policy to understand what their purchased travel insurance covers and under what conditions. If the customer wants to make an insurance claim it is their responsibility to contact Flight Network as soon as possible. Insurance policy cancellations or refunds are not available once the reservation has been booked as the live policies are active as soon as the booking is completed.

Due to Insurance policy regulations, it is the responsibility of the email account holder to forward this policy and it’s accompanying booklet(s) to all travellers on the booking. Please contact us if you require more information regarding travel insurance.
* Emergency or Technical Stops
Emergency or Technical Stops:
On occasion, an airline or airlines on your itinerary may operate certain routes with technical stops. This means that the plane will stop enroute to fill up on fuel or to deplane passengers without prior notification to us. This may also happen in emergency cases for the safety of the passengers and crew members, due to force majeure, technical and/or political issues. We as the travel agency, do not have control of any such circumstances.

Travelling/Connecting in European Schengen Countries:
Travellers from countries that currently enjoy visa-free travel throughout Europe’s passport-free Schengen zone face having to apply for a document similar to the US ESTA system, as the EU beefs up security checks. The European Travel Information and Authorization System (ETIAS), which could apply to a post-Brexit Britain, will see visitors from 60 ‘visa-waiver’ countries including the US, Canada and Australia having to pay a €5 application fee for the travel document. The authorization, which the European Commission said will take no longer than 10 minutes and described as a “lighter more visitor-friendly regime” than a visa, will be valid for five years and for multiple trips. It will only apply to those 18 and over. Nationals of the visa-free countries will still be able to travel without one but must obtain the authorization prior to travel in the Schengen Area. All nationals of third countries, which have yet not reached a visa-liberalization agreement with the Schengen member states, need to obtain a visa prior of their arrival in Europe.  If you have two connections/stopovers in the Schengen area (for example Mumbai-Vienna-Frankfurt-Chicago or Nairobi-Zurich-Frankfurt-Chișinău), you will be required to get a Schengen Visa to transit or you will get denied boarding. To check whether you need a Schengen Visa to travel to one of the Schengen member countries, here is the list of countries, citizens of which must apply for a Schengen Visa prior to their travel to the EU.
Passports/Visas/Health Requirements:
Please note that many countries require that your passport be valid for a period of (a minimum) of six months beyond your return date. You should ensure that you meet the passport, visa, affidavit, return/onward ticket, health and other requirements of the countries you wish to visit and those that you transit (even if it is for a plane change). We accept no responsibility if you should be denied boarding or deported for any reason, including your age. Please check the documentation and/or inoculations needed for your destination(s). For further questions regarding travel documentation please contact Flight Network directly. Our office is open 24/7 for your convenience. Obtaining passports and visas may require lengthy processing times and entry to another country may be refused even if your required information and travel documents are complete. We accept no responsibility if you should be denied boarding or deported for any reason including your age. You, the customer must be eighteen years of age (please note the restrictions below with respect to children travelling alone to Europe).

* Samsung Note 7 Banned from most Aircrafts
Samsung Note 7 Banned from most Aircrafts
Passengers and flight crews will be banned from bringing Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones on all airline flights under emergency orders issued by both Transport Canada and the U.S. Department of Transportation in response to reports of the phones catching fire. The phones may not be carried on board or packed in checked bags on flights to and from Canada and the United States or within either country. The phones also can’t be shipped as air cargo. Passengers with the phones will not be allowed to board planes. And those who try to evade the U.S. ban by packing the phones in checked luggage may be subject to criminal prosecution in addition to fines. Transport officials in both countries warned that carrying the phones in checked luggage increases the potential danger to the flight. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission says there have been nearly 100 reports of batteries in Note 7 phones overheating in the United States.
* Seat Selection
Not all tickets offer free seat selection. Some seats can be selected free of cost during online check-in within 24 hours of departure time and some seats require a fee to be paid to the airline. Each airline has a different policy on seat selection. Please verify this information prior to purchase. Seat selection requests at time of booking are not guaranteed and are non-refundable. The airline has full rights to amend any seat selection without prior notice. If a voluntary change is made to a booking, any previously purchased seat selections are not guaranteed to be transferred to new flights. If a flight booking is voluntarily canceled, seat selection requests are non-refundable. Flight Network charges a nominal service charge to select seats for your booking, you will be notified of the amount at time of purchase.
* Self-Transfer Guarantee
Self-transfer Guarantee
“Self-transfer guarantee” is an exclusive policy designed to assist those passengers that are impacted by an involuntary schedule change, delay or cancellation of their confirmed flight resulting from factors, which can occur in the standard course of air transportation. With the implementation of this policy (Self-transfer guarantee), we can offer our customers the best possible price and service experience in the travel industry. We strive to make your journey as smooth and comfortable as possible. Upon activation of this policy, in the event of an involuntary schedule change or cancellation, we shall find you a reasonable alternative flight option(s) or other means of transportation to your destination, or a refund of the unused flight portion. All passengers should be in contact with Flight Network and not the airline in order to be covered under this policy. This policy covers two categories depending on the urgency of your file.
Category 1: ( Where the schedule change takes place more than 48 hours prior to departure)
This option applies ONLY if the schedule change (Flight change, or cancellation) takes place outside of 48 hours prior to the first leg of your confirmed itinerary, which prevents you from reaching your final destination, or your arrival in destination is delayed by more than 24 hours after the original arrival time i.e. you would either miss your connecting flight(s) or your flight(s) is cancelled. If you become aware of the schedule change under Category 1, you must get in touch with us immediately without delay either by telephone, email or via our online chat platform found on our website. If you fail to contact us in a timely manner, you will not be covered under this guarantee. If we become aware of the change first, under category 1, we will get in touch with you within a reasonable time. Once we are informed of the change or cancellation either by you or the airline, at our discretion, we will offer you one of the following resolutions: ● We will find you an alternative transportation to your destination. If we can’t re-protect you with the same carrier, we will offer you an alternative flight(s) or other means of transportation to your destination entirely at our cost. In case of lack of availability, and no alternative can be offered and once we are in a mutual agreement , you can purchase the similar ticket at the airport in the same cabin class and we will refund you the price difference between the two tickets. Any other extra services or upgrades related to these new tickets will not be covered under this policy. ● For all unused portions, we will refund you accordingly. This option will be offered in case we fail to offer you an alternative transportation. The options will be communicated to you via phone or email.

Communication and notices: Once we provide you with alternative options, your response is due back to us within 48 hours the latest in exceptional cases. If the 48 hour window is passed, the offer becomes null and void and is no longer covered under this guarantee. ***If you are offered the above mentioned alternatives by the airline(s) directly or at the airport, we cannot be held responsible for any further compensation or reimbursement.
Late Check-in’s / No Shows
Flight Network is not responsible for any late check-ins that occur due to non-compliance with individual airline check-in guidelines for any segments within the confirmed itinerary.

If Flight Network determines (based on the information provided by the operating carriers/booking systems) that the passenger has had sufficient connecting time (even after a delayed arrival), the self-transfer guarantee will not apply. Any related costs will become the passenger’s responsibility in any such cases.

Assistive Devices:
Flight Network is committed to serving persons with disabilities who use assistive devices to obtain, use or benefit from our goods and/or services. While Flight Network and its employees are committed to familiarizing themselves with the various assistive devices that may be used by customers, where an employee is not immediately able to service the customer via the assistive device he/she uses, that employee will immediately refer the matter to Stuart Baum, CHRO (stuart.baum@flightnetwork.com), who will be vested with the responsibility to achieve the necessary customer service to that customer via that assistive device as quickly as reasonably possible.
Use of Service Animals and Support Persons:
Flight Network is committed to serving persons with disabilities who use assistive devices to obtain, use or benefit from our goods and/or services. Persons with disabilities may bring their service animal on the parts of our premises that are open to our customers or other third parties, and the animal is not otherwise excluded by law. Flight Network will ensure that all employees, including volunteers and third parties, dealing with customers are trained in how to interact with persons with disabilities who are accompanied by a service animal. It is the responsibility of the person with a service animal to control the animal at all times. In the event an employee is allergic to animals, alternative arrangements will be negotiated. Any person with a disability who is accompanied by a support person will be allowed to enter Flight Network’s premises open to customers or other third parties with his or her support person. At no time will a person with a disability who is accompanied by a support person be prevented from having access to his or her support person while on the Company’s premises. Consent from the person with a disability is required when communicating private issues related to the person with a disability, in the presence of a support person.
Notice of Temporary Disruptions:
Flight Network will make reasonable efforts to provide customers with notice in the event of a planned or unexpected disruption in the facilities or services normally used by persons with disabilities. This notice will include information about the reason for the disruption, how long the disruption is expected to last, and a description of any alternative facilities or services, if available. This notice will be provided in accessible formats and will be displayed prominently on the company’s website.
Feedback Process:
Flight Network welcomes feedback, including feedback in the delivery of goods and/or services to persons with disabilities. Customers can submit feedback to Allison Eberle, Vice President Operations (allison.eberle@flightnetwork.com). Customers can expect to hear back in 72 hours. Complaints will be addressed according to the Company’s regular complaint management procedures.
