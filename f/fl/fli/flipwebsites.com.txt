For example, some of my advertising is served by third parties and may include cookies that enable the advertiser to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before. Other features available on my website may offer services operated by third parties and may use cookies or other technology to gather information. I do not control the use of cookies or technology used by third parties or the resulting information, and consequently I am not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties.
