Nor do we collect any information about criminal convictions and offences.
Information you make available in job applications or forum posts or other communications via our websites is your responsibility and you should think very carefully before including or sharing any sensitive personal data.
7. Sharing your data
Trusted third parties
We sometimes share your personal data with trusted third parties such as third-party service providers. We have data processor contracts in place with such third parties which require them to respect the security of your data and to treat it in accordance with data protection legislation.
Examples of the kind of third parties we work with are:
External payment service providers to process any payments you send us
Website platform and software providers to assist us with our internet content and services
Operational companies such as delivery couriers and Royal Mail
IT companies who support our website and other business systems
Accountancy companies who administer our accounts
We may also share your personal data with third parties where required by law or where we have another legitimate interest in doing so.
Our industry partners
On some occasions we may provide your contact details to other companies in our industry for their own purposes, for example so they may contact you about services and events you may be interested in. However, we will only ever provide your details in these circumstances where we have your informed consent.
Subject to appropriate controls or anonymisation, we may also provide limited data to our advertisers to provide them with insight of our readers.
Our business
We may, from time to time, expand, reduce or sell our publications and this may involve the transfer of divisions or the whole business to new owners. If this happens, your personal data will, where relevant, be transferred to the new owner or controlling party, subject to data protection law.
8. Transferring your personal data outside the EEA
We are based in the UK but on occasion may transfer your personal data outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”).
Examples of situations where we may transfer your personal data outside the EEA
You are based outside the UK and place an order with us, we may need to provide your contact details to a courier outside the EEA.
You ask us to send an enquiry or job application to the poster of an advert on one of our websites or in one of our publications.
9. What if you don’t want to share your personal data with us?
If you fail to provide certain information when requested, we may not be able to provide you with our content, products or services.
10. What should you do if your personal data changes?
You should tell us, so we can update our records. The contact details for this purpose are in this privacy policy.
11. How do we keep your data secure?
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected data security breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a suspected breach where we are legally required to do so.
12. For how long do we retain your personal data?
We retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of providing you with our content, subscriptions and other services and products.
In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data so that it can no longer be associated with you, in which case we may use such information without further notice to you. For example, we may collect demographic information from our readers, anonymise it and provide it to our advertisers.
13. Your rights
Your rights in connection with your personal data
Under certain circumstances, by law you have the right to:
Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected.
Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below).
Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes.
Request the restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.
Request the transfer of your personal data to another party.
If you want to review, verify, correct or request erasure of your personal data, object to the processing of your personal data, or request that we transfer a copy of your personal data to another party, please contact us.
No fee usually required
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is clearly unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with the request in such circumstances.
What we may need from you
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is another appropriate security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.
14. Your right to withdraw consent
In the limited circumstances where we rely on your consent to process personal data about you, you have the right to withdraw your consent for that specific processing at any time.
To withdraw your consent, please contact the DPO by emailing dataprotection@dvvmediainternational.
Where you have requested that we provide your personal data to one of our industry partners (for example an enquiry in response to a used vehicle listing on Commercial Motor or to enable an industry partner to market directly to you), you will need to contact that third party directly to withdraw your consent to that third party processing your personal data.
15. Your right to opt out of direct marketing
There are several ways you can stop direct marketing communications from us:
Opt out of receiving promotional emails and marketing when you create your account or subscribe to any of our content.
If you have an account, log in and change your preferences.
Click the ‘unsubscribe’ link in any email communication we send you. We will then stop sending you any further emails from that particular publication or newsletter.
Contact our DPO at dataprotection@dvvmediainternational or write to Data Protection Officer, DVV Media International Limited of 6th Floor, Chancery House, St Nicholas Way, Sutton, Surrey, SM1 1JB
Please note that you may continue to receive communications for a short period after changing your preferences while we update our systems.
16. Data Protection Officer
We have appointed a DPO to oversee compliance with this privacy policy. If you have any questions about this privacy policy or how we handle your personal data, please contact the DPO at this email address: dataprotection@dvvmediainternational.com. You have the right to make a complaint at any time to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), the UK supervisory authority for data protection issues.
17. Changes to this Privacy Policy
We reserve the right to update this privacy policy at any time. We may also notify you in other ways from time to time about the processing of your personal data.
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact the DPO by emailing dataprotection@dvvmediainternational.com
