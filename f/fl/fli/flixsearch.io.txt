Privacy policy | Flixboss
Flixboss was created by users, for users. We wanted to build a service that was free but also where private information was handled in a responsible , secure and non-malicious manner. The guiding principle from the start has been "do unto others as you would have them do unto you"... and we wouldn't want anyone else to abuse our private data.
Updates to the policy
You will always find the latest version of our privacy policy on this page (yes, same page you are looking at now). In case the privacy policy is changed we will do our best to update our users about the new terms.
What data do we collect?
The information that we are collecting can be divided into two groups:
Information of a technical nature
This type of data is gathered automatically just by browsing the site. Examples include the IP number of the client, the browser type and version, the device that was used, the pages that were visited, the time that was spent on each page etc.
User provided information
When signing up for the service our users are given the option to voluntarily provide more information about themselves. Examples include name, gender or birthday and none of these are required to be able to use the service. We also store which movies and series a user has interacted with, placed into their watchlist, seen or hidden. In case the user signs up for our weekly newsletter we store the email address.
What is the data used for and how is it shared with third parties?
The main purpose of storing private information is to enable personalisation functionality on the site. You need to create an account to be able to use the watchlist features for example. Same goes for hiding or rating seen movies / series.
Another purpose is to understand our users better so that we can improve the funcionality of the site. For this we use analytics tools such as Google Analytics or Hotjar.
Some technical variables are used in an anonymized fashion for serving of ads and shared with ad partners such as Google Adsense, for example to be able to target ads to users only in a specific geographic region or during a specific time of day. We don't share any of the user provided data variables (so called first party data) with third parties unless explicitly consented to by the user.
Our weekly newsletters are sent using a third party tool called Mailchimp and for that reason all emails are also stored with them.
How is the collected data stored?
The data is stored securely on our servers, and only for as long as it is needed to fulfill the purpose of it, as it is described here in the privacy policy. After that, it is either removed or anonymized.
Do you use cookies (and if so, how)?
Yes, we do. Most of the basic funcionality of the site can be used without having cookies switched on, but some features require them. An example is the user watchlist where saved movies and series are stored in a cookie locally. If you want to browse the site as a logged in user you will also need to accept cookies.
