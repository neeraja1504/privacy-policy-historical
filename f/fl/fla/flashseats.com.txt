Collection and Use of Anonymous Information
Anonymous information is not personally identifiable information. Anonymous information is information that is collected automatically that relates to, but is not limited to, how certain features of our website are used, what general region our visitors are contacting us from and how many people visit our website at any given time. We use this information, and may share with, license to or sell this information to third parties, for the purpose of allowing targeted marketing through our website.
Collection and Use of Personally Identifiable Information
In the course of selling tickets or other merchandise, we may collect and maintain certain non-public personal information that will help us to efficiently perform various transactions. We may be required to share your personal information with certain entertainment organizations and venues (an 'Event Host') or the Event Host's third party service providers as part of our contractual relationship with them. Also, your personal information may be entered into software systems maintained by our third party application service providers (e.g. our customer service system) for the purpose of allowing us to conduct our services. To the extent that your personal information is used in the foregoing manner, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that our service providers do not use your personal information for any purpose other than delivery of our services.
We do not collect personal information (such as names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses or credit card numbers) about you, except when you specifically provide the information on a voluntary basis. Your personal information may be collected as you:
Become a registered user of flashseats.com;
Bid on, or purchase Right(s) ('Rights' is defined in our Terms and Conditions of Use)
Sign-up or subscribe for products or services that we may periodically make available; or
Receive Right(s) transferred to you from one of our account holders. (You will be notified if your personal information is collected in this manner by receipt of a transfer email from one of our account holders.)
We use your personally identifiable information for several purposes:
Transactional Communications
If you are bidding for or selling Right(s) the Company utilizes your personal information to communicate with you regarding the status of your bid or auction.
If you have posted a request to purchase Right(s) (an 'ask'), the Company utilizes your personal information to notify you of responses to your ask.
If you are purchasing Right(s), the Company utilizes your personal information to complete the purchase transaction and to communicate with you about your ticket order, to provide you with instructions on how to use and/or access your electronic ticket to gain admission to an event or venue or other inquiry.
Whenever you purchase Right(s) we may be required to share your personal information with a third-party credit card processor to facilitate completion of your transaction. The credit card processor may share the same information with your credit card issuer in connection with gathering data related to use of their cards, rewards programs or other purposes. You are urged to read and become familiar with the privacy policies governing the use of your credit cards.
When you purchase Right(s), we may be contractually required to provide your personal information to the Event Host so that they may communicate with you about the event you are going to attend. Under those circumstances, we cannot offer you the option to opt-out from having your information passed to the Event Host. Event Hosts are not subject to the provisions of this Privacy Policy, which means that they may use your personal information for purposes other than contacting you about the event you are going to attend, unless you contact them and request otherwise. You are urged to read and become familiar with the privacy policies governing events and venues prior to purchasing Right(s).
Should you determine to sell or otherwise transfer your Right(s), we may be contractually required to provide your personal information to the Event Host's third party service providers who provide the Event Host with such transfer services. Under those circumstances, you will be required to grant to such service providers the right to access your user profile and Right(s) information in order to sell or transfer your Right(s). In that event, we cannot offer you the option to opt-out from having your information passed to such service providers. Such service providers are not subject to the provisions of this Privacy Policy, which means that they may use your personal information for purposes other than to effect the sale or other transfer of your Right(s), unless you contact them and request otherwise. You are urged to read and become familiar with the privacy policy governing the transfer or sale of your Right(s) by such service providers prior to granting such service providers rights to access your user profile and Right(s) information.
Whenever you receive Right(s) transferred to you from one of our account holders, your personal information will be provided to us by the originating account holder. You will be notified if your personal information is collected in this manner by receipt of a transfer email from one of our account holders. When you accept the Right, you may be required to supply additional personal information in order to complete the transfer transaction.

Whenever you transfer an account balance to your bank account we may be required to share your personal information with a third-party financial processor to facilitate completion of your transaction. The processor may share the same information with your bank in connection with the transaction. You are urged to read and become familiar with the privacy policies governing the bank accounts to which you transfer funds using our system.

Opt-Out
A 'cookie' is a small piece of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies do not damage your computer. We use cookies on certain pages of our site. We may also offer certain features that are only available through the use of a cookie. Among other reasons why we use cookies, cookies allow you to enter your password less frequently during a session. Cookies can also help us provide information which is targeted to your interests. Cookies are stored on your hard drive, not on our site. If you do not desire the functionality created by cookies, you have the option to disable that function. To disable the cookie function, you may disable the function on your browser. Note that some site features may not function if cookies are disabled.
Security
The Company uses industry standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal identifiable information, such as data encryption, firewalls, system security measures and Secure Socket Layers ('SSL'). Please be advised that 'perfect security' does not exist in commercial Internet applications and that such security measures may not prevent all loss, misuse or alteration of information on our websites. Therefore, although we work very hard to protect your privacy, we do not promise and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private. The registration pages, where you enter your personal and credit card information, are secure. This means that any information you send us is protected by encryption. Additionally, anytime we ask for your credit card number, we transmit that number using SSL encryption. It is easy to tell when you are protected by encryption your browser displays a lock or a key which is no longer broken or it changes color when you are on a secure page. The actual icon and its location may vary depending on your browser. For example, Internet Explorer has a 'Security' padlock icon at the bottom right of the page, which appears closed when you have entered a secure page. Except as specifically permitted by this section, you may not disclose your Flash Seats password to any third parties nor share it with any third parties. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personally identifiable information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password.If you have any questions related to this policy, please email the Flash Seats Privacy Officer at privacy@flashseats.com.
