You can choose not to provide certain Personal Information, but then you will not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the Personal Information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future visits to our website, improving our website, offering you a customized client account center, communicating with you as well as sending you our monthly newsletter.

We will require you to provide an acceptable password and a verifiable email address.
