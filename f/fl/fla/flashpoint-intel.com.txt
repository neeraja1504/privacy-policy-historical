Onward Transfer to Third Parties under the Privacy Shield
Like many businesses, we hire other companies to perform certain business-related services. We may disclose personal information to certain types of third party companies but only to the extent needed to enable them to provide such services. The types of companies that may receive personal information and their functions are: direct marketing assistance, lead generation services, order fulfillment, billing, customer service, data storage, hosting services, disaster recovery services, and sales support companies. All such third parties function as our agents, performing services at our instruction and on our behalf pursuant to contracts which require they provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by this privacy policy and implemented by Flashpoint. We may also disclose personal information to our affiliates in order to support marketing, sale and delivery of Products.
In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
Flashpoint\’s accountability for personal data that it receives under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to a third party is described in the Privacy Shield Principles. In particular, Flashpoint remains responsible and liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if third-party agents that it engages to process the personal data on its behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless Flashpoint proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
Opt-In and Opt-Out to Certain Onward Transfers under the Privacy Shield ****
Individuals have the opportunity to opt-out of sharing of their personal data with third parties other than our agents or before we use it for a purpose other than which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized.
