Collection of Information
In various ways we collect information that is volunteered by visitors to our site. Certain identifying information, such as name, street address, city, state, zip code and email address, is gathered at certain interactive areas on the site, such as when you subscribe to our print or digital publication while online. Wherever possible and practical, we give users options about submitting information.
Use of Collected Information
With respect to advertisements, an advertiser will inform us which type of audience it seeks to reach, and we may place advertisements on Flaunt.com that fit the advertiserâ€™s criteria. Pop-up advertisements may be displayed to a targeted audience on Flaunt.com based on these criteria. The advertisers are not permitted to access your account or any of your personally identifiable information.
We also use tracking information to determine which areas of our site users like and do not like based on traffic to those areas.
We create aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers. This allows our advertisers to advertise more effectively, and allows our users to receive advertisements that are pertinent to their interests. We do not track the usage patterns of individual users, so an advertiser will never know that a specific user clicked on a particular ad.
