FluentU - Privacy
Use of Personal Information
When you Register.
When you register with FluentU, you can create your own profile. If your profile is visible, your profile information, as well as your name and picture are displayed to other registered users as well as visitors to the Site.
Our Use.
We receive and store any personal information you enter on the Site or give to us voluntarily in any other way and may use it to contact you from time to time. This means we may contact you by email, phone and/or cell number (including use of automated dialing equipment), text (SMS) message, or any other means of communication that your wireless or other telecommunications device may be capable of receiving (e.g. video etc.). We may also send you information or offers from time to time to a postal address or email address we have on file. If you provide your name for a promotional offer to enter a sweepstakes or contest, and win a prize, we will post a winner's list online, and will file your name with state agencies if required by law.
Vendors.
We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples might include sending email, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links and providing customer service. They have access to your personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.
Invite a Friend.
If you do become a registered user, you can also share links to videos on the Site with other individuals by providing us with their email addresses. Using the information you give us on these potential users, we will send them an email message including a link to the Site, and we may include an invitation to join FluentU. The only way these individuals can become registered users, however, is if they come to our Site and register themselves. We do not use this information for other purposes.
Other Uses.
We may use your personal information to contact you about FluentU's products or services, or for other purposes in which you have expressed an interest, for example, if you have contacted customer service or made an inquiry.
Service Related Announcements. We will provide you with service and account related announcements on occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, or the delivery of a service or product is delayed we might send you an email, or other message, or if there is some service issue with something you might have ordered. Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to cancel your registration on our Site by sending an email to us at support@fluentu.com.
Exceptional Circumstances.
If FluentFlix Limited, or any of its lines of businesses or affiliated companies, is sold or disposed of as a going concern, whether by merger, sale of assets or otherwise, the relevant databases of FluentU could, in whole or in part, be sold as part of that transaction. Therefore, information about registered users of and visitors to the Site, including recordings and personal information, may be disclosed as part of any merger or acquisition, creation of a separate business or sale or pledge of our company assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which personal information would be transferred as one of the business assets of the company. Information about our users, including personal information and user recordings, may also need to be disclosed in connection with a commercial transaction where FluentFlix Limited, or an affiliate, seeks financing, investment, support or funding. We also may have to release personally identifying information when it is necessary to comply with judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, orders, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of FluentU, its users or others.
