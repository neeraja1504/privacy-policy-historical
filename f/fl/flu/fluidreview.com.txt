SurveyMonkey Apply/FluidReview Privacy Policy | SurveyMonkey
SurveyMonkey Apply/FluidReview is an online application system that helps organizations collect applications, manage subscriptions and facilitate reviews. This privacy statement applies to apply.surveymonkey.com/www.fluidreview.com (“SurveyMonkey Apply/FluidReview”). SurveyMonkey Apply/FluidReview is a service provided by SurveyMonkey Inc. and its affiliates.
Personal information and data collected, used and disclosed in the course of using SurveyMonkey Apply/FluidReview will be treated in the manner set out below and in SurveyMonkey’s main Privacy Policy at /mp/policy/privacy-policy. We use, disclose, process and handle the information we collect in accordance with the main Privacy Policy for survey creators (except that references to survey data should be read as references to applicant data or submission data in the context of SurveyMonkey Apply/FluidReview).
EU – U.S. Privacy Shield. SurveyMonkey Inc. (and its subsidiary company, Infinity Box Inc.) participates in and has certified its compliance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework.  SurveyMonkey  is committed to subjecting all personal data received from European Union (EU) member countries to the Framework’s applicable Principles. To learn more about the Privacy Shield Framework, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield List. https://www.privacyshield.gov/list.
When SurveyMonkey receives personal information under the Privacy Shield and then transfers it to a third-party service provider acting as an agent on SurveyMonkey’s behalf, SurveyMonkey has certain liability under the Privacy Shield if both (i) the agent processes the information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield and (ii) SurveyMonkey is responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, SurveyMonkey is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, SurveyMonkey may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
