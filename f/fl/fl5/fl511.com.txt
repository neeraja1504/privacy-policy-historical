Internet Privacy Policy
Thank you for visiting the Florida's Statewide 511 Web site. Your privacy is very important to us. Simply stated, our policy is to collect no personal information about you when you visit our Web site unless you affirmatively choose to make such information available to us.
When you visit our Web site, our Web server automatically recognizes only the Internet domain and IP address from which you accessed our Web site. This information does not result in the identification of your personal e-mail address or other personal information.
In addition, we gather information regarding the volume and timing of access to our Web site by collecting information on the date, time and Web site pages accessed by visitors to the Web site. We do this so that we can improve the content of our Web site, and this information is not shared with other organizations. Again, only aggregate information is collected, and individual visitors' personal information is not identified.
If you choose to share personal information with us - sending us a message or filling out an electronic form with personal information - we will use the information only for the purposes you authorized. Some of the information may be saved for a designated period of time to comply with Florida's archiving policies, but we will not disclose the information to third parties or other government agencies, unless required to do so by state or federal law. And if we are required to disclose information about you by law, we will make every effort to notify you of the disclosure in advance.
If you have other questions about our privacy policies, or have ideas about improving our policies, please feel free to e-mail us or you can reach us by telephone at 850-414-4590.
Under Florida law, e-mail addresses are public records. If you do not want your e-mail address released in response to a public-records request, do not send electronic mail to this entity. Instead, contact this office by phone or in writing.
