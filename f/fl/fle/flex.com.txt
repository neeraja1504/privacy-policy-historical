If you wish to exercise any of the above rights, please contact us using the contact details specified
below for the Data Protection Liaison Officer. Such requests should include appropriate identity verification information (such as your name, address, email address or other information reasonably required).
Where we receive a request to exercise one of these rights, we shall provide information on the action we take on the request without undue delay and in any event within one month of receipt of the request. This may be extended by a further two months in certain circumstances, for example where requests are complex or numerous.
The information will be provided free of charge, except where requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character. In these circumstances we may charge a reasonable fee or may refuse to act on the request. We will advise an individual  of any fees prior to proceeding with a request.
We may ask for additional information to verify an individual's  identity before carrying out a request.
Where we do not carry out a request, we shall inform the individual without delay and within one month of receipt of the request, providing our reasons for not taking the action requested.
Right to access personal data
Individuals have the right to confirm the following with us:
1.  Whether or not we process personal data about them
2.  Certain specified information about the processing
Individuals also have a right to access the personal data and be provided with a copy.
Right to restrict processing of personal data
Individuals have the right to request that we restrict processing of their  personal data where one of the following applies:
1.  An individual contests the accuracy of the personal data. The restriction will apply until we have taken steps to verify the accuracy of the personal data;
2.  The processing is unlawful but an individual  does not want the personal data to be erased and  requests restriction instead;
3.  We no longer require the personal data for the purposes of processing, but it is still required by an individual  in connection with a legal claim;
4.  An individual has exercised their right to object to the processing. The restriction will apply until we have taken steps to verify whether we have compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing.
Right to object to processing of personal data
Where  personal data is used to target marketing to an individual , they have the right to object to this at any stage.
An individual  also has the right to object to processing of their  personal data where the legal basis of the processing is our legitimate interests. We will have to stop processing until we are able to verify that we have compelling legitimate grounds for processing which override the individual's interests, rights and freedoms, or alternatively that we need to continue processing for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
Right to rectification of personal data
If an individual  believes that the personal data we hold on them is inaccurate, they may request that it be amended. They may also request that incomplete personal data be completed, including by providing a supplementary statement.
Right to request erasure of personal data ("right to be forgotten")

2.  they were collected or otherwise processed;
3.  The processing was based on consent which has been  withdrawn  and there is no other legal basis for processing;
There are also certain exceptions where we may refuse a request for erasure, for example, where the personal data is required to comply with a legal obligation or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
If an individual does request erasure of their personal data, this will potentially remove records which we hold for their benefit, such as their presence on a suppression list and they will have to contact us to provide personal information if they wish for us to hold this in future.
Right to Data Portability
Where we are relying upon the legal basis either of consent or that the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which an individual  is  a party, and that personal data is processed by automatic means (e.g. electronically), an individual  has the right to receive all the personal data which they have provided to us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and to transmit this to another controller directly, where this is technically feasible.
