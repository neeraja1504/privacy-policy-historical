Fleshlight.com Privacy Policy
Our Guarantee
Maintaining your privacy and providing a hassle-free, enjoyable, and discreet shopping experience is of utmost importance to us.
We will never sell, rent, or share any information about you or your order to anyone for any reason. The information you supply for your order is used to discreetly deliver the items you've purchased. Once you've received your order, you may occasionally hear from us via email unless you've requested otherwise.
We may periodically make changes to this Privacy Policy. It is your responsibility to review this Privacy Policy frequently and remain informed about any changes to it.
Billing Information
Once your order is shipped, your credit card or online check information is removed from our database and can not be accessed by anyone for any reason. If you are paying by credit card, the charges on your statement will read as originating from " FLi, S.L. " and will include a contact phone number, as required.
Shipping Information
All orders are shipped discreetly in a plain, cardboard box. The shipping label will identify the shipper as "FLi, S.L." and will not reference "Fleshlight.com", "Sex Toy" or any other identifying description related to products designed for adults.
Contact Methods
Once you've placed an order at eu.fleshlight.com, you will receive two emails if you choose to include a valid email address: one confirms your order for future reference, the other includes important shipping information, including your DHL tracking number. If we have difficulty processing your order or there are complications related to shipping and delivering your package, you may also receive email contact or attempts to reach you by phone. HOWEVER, all customer service representatives are trained to identify themselves as representatives of "FLi, S.L." and to disclose the reason for contact only to the person whose name appears on the order. Furthermore, representatives will never leave voice messages (unless verbal or written consent is given by the customer during a prior point of contact). From time to time we may send out promotions to existing customers. If you ever receive any unwanted contact from us that is unsolicited, please Contact Us so that we can promptly make the necessary correction.
