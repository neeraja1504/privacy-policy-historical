In addition, like many websites, when You access the Site, we may automatically record certain information from Your system by using different types of other common Internet technology. This automatically collected information may include Your Internet Protocol address (“IP Address”), a unique device or User ID, version of software installed, system type, the content and pages that You access on the Site, and the dates and times that You visit Site.
Personally Identifiable Information
ILF only collects personally identifiable information that is voluntarily provided to us by a User.
The Way We Use This Information
Automatically Collected Information
ILF uses cookies and other automatically collected information to identify prior Users, to track usage of the Site, and for analytical purposes to help us improve the Site and our business in general. We may on occasion provide this information to an affiliate or third party to assist us in providing these functions.
Personally Identifiable Information
The personally identifiable information that Users voluntarily provide to ILF may be used by ILF and our Affiliates for administrative purposes; for authentication purposes; to properly operate, maintain, and provide You with the features and functionality of the Site; to customize and personalize features for You and otherwise enrich your experience when using the Site; to present You with promotions, advertisement, and opportunities We believe may be of interest to You; to enable our affiliates and to assist us in operating, maintaining, and providing our Services and products to You; to enable us to carry out our obligations arising from any contracts/subscriptions entered into with You; to notify You about changes to the Privacy Policy or the Terms of Service, Site, or Site (if we deem it appropriate); to investigate and help prevent potentially unlawful activity or activities that threaten the integrity of the Site, ILF Content, or ILF Technology; to investigate allegations of fraud or violations of the Terms; to enforce or apply our rights under the Terms; and/or to protect the rights, property, or safety of any of our Users or others; to improve the quality and design of the Site and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing your preferences and trends.
Alternative Use of Personally Identifiable Information
Although consent for the use or disclosure of personally identifiable information will usually be obtained at the time of collection, there may be occasions where consent is sought after the personally identifiable information has been collected (but before use). If ILF intends to use personally identifiable information for a purpose other than what was identified at the time the personally identifiable information was collected, then we will obtain Your prior consent to that additional use unless it is for a situation where consent can be implied through Your actions with us.
Security of Information
ILF maintains our systems in accordance with commercially reasonable industry standards to preserve the integrity and security of Your personally identifiable information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information You Transmit through the Site, and You do so at Your own risk. Once we receive Your transmission of information, we make commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems including contractual and/or other safeguards to ensure that affiliates, related companies or third party service providers (“Third Parties”) provide a comparable level of protection for your personally identifiable information. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. “Perfect security" does not exist on the Internet, and You use the Site at Your own risk. If You have reason to believe that Your information stored with us is no longer secure, you must immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us as set out on our Site.
ILF has safeguards to protect personally identifiable information against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification, regardless of the format in which the information is held. Personally identifiable information will be safeguarded by physical measures (locking filing cabinets, restricting access to offices), organizational measures (employee training, limiting access on a necessity basis) and technological measures (Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology passwords, firewalls and encryption). Some records, including older records, may be stored at an offsite storage facility, in either paper or electronic format. Where records are stored with off-site storage facilities, ILF uses contractual or other means to ensure that your privacy rights are protected. As a result, personally identifiable information may be subject to legal requirements of foreign countries as applicable, such as the requirement to disclose personally identifiable information to foreign governments.
Limiting Use, Disclosure, and Retention
ILF always uses contractual or other safeguards to ensure protection of personally identifiable information and such information will be used and disclosed only for the purpose for which it was collected or as required by law, except with the consent of the individual. When personally identifiable information is no longer required to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected, it will be destroyed, erased or made anonymous, provided there are no legal requirements for its continued retention should the same be possible.
Access to personally identifiable information is limited to ILF employees with a business need to know and Third Parties who require access for business purposes. From time to time, ILF will disclose personally identifiable information to others, including to affiliated entities or unrelated companies that carry out certain responsibilities on behalf of ILF. ILF takes necessary steps to ensure that the affiliated entities or unrelated companies do not use or disclose personally identifiable information for any purpose other than the specific purpose requested.
Accuracy
ILF will take all reasonable efforts to ensure that personally identifiable information is accurate, complete, and up-to-date in relation to the purposes for which the personally identifiable information is to be used.
Individual Access
Access to personally identifiable information, including how we use and disclose the personally identifiable information may be obtained on written request. An individual can challenge the accuracy and completeness of their personally identifiable information and have it amended as appropriate. An individual’s written request for access to personally identifiable information will be answered within a reasonable time and at a reasonable cost. We will assist any individual who informs us that they need assistance in preparing a written request and we may require an individual to provide sufficient information to permit us to provide an account of the existence, use and disclosure of personally identifiable information. Any such identifying information shall be used only for this purpose. If an individual successfully establishes the inaccuracy or incompleteness of personally identifiable information such personally identifiable information will be amended to ensure that it is accurate. If a challenge to the accuracy of personally identifiable information is not resolved to the satisfaction of the individual, we will document the content of the challenge. The amended personally identifiable information or the existence of the unresolved challenge, as the case may be, may be transmitted to affiliated entities or unrelated companies having access to the information in question. Requests for access to personally identifiable information we hold about an individual may be refused if permitted or required by law. In such a case, the reasons for denying access will be provided to the individual upon request which reasons may include: information that contains references to other individuals or contains confidential commercial information which cannot be redacted from the file; information collected in the course of investigating a breach of an agreement or in the course of a formal dispute resolution process; and information that is subject to solicitor-client privilege.
