We use technology, including cookies (a piece of data that is placed on your computer when you visit a website) to automatically collect certain information, as described above, that we then use for system administration and website maintenance, troubleshooting, and to identify you when you open our email or visit our website through your computer or mobile device so we can enhance your online experience and make our advertising more relevant. We may also offer certain features that are only available through the use of this technology.

Fleming's does not sell your personal information to third parties. Fleming's will only use and share your information as described in this policy to:
Create an account for you on our website or mobile applications;
Enroll you in a loyalty program account and other programs at your request, and to register your loyalty program account on our website and mobile application;
Communicate with you about products and services we offer, including sending you emails and text messages, for restaurant promotions, special offerings, gift cards and other important information;
Analyze the use of our products and services;
We may share your information with certain affiliates and third parties who have agreed to protect your privacy. Such information sharing relates to:
assisting Fleming's in communicating with you about our offers;
fulfilling requests for products and services, improving our services, conducting research, and providing anonymous reporting for internal and external clients;
assisting in providing our services (for example, to process credit and debit card transactions, conduct
statistical analyses, and to comply with unsubscribe lists); and assisting with loss prevention in cases of suspected fraud or theft.
Provide your information to any company who may purchase some or all of Fleming's assets in the future; and
Enforce the incorporated policies and Terms and Conditions of use, to comply with legal obligations, and otherwise manage our business.
Fleming's may combine personal and non-personal information we collect or obtain with other information we obtain from third parties. We may transfer your information to Fleming's partners and affiliates for this purpose. Fleming's may also share aggregated information that cannot be used to identify you with our clients and business partners.
HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION?
We work to protect your information both online and offline by using appropriate technical, administrative and physical procedures to protect personal information from loss, misuse, or alteration.
We limit access to personal information to those who have a business need. Employees who violate Fleming's customer privacy safeguards are subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination.
When we share your information with third-party service providers as described above, we only provide those third parties with the information necessary to perform their service and we require that they protect your information and not use it for any other purpose. We cannot, however, ensure or guarantee the security of any information you send to us and you do so at your own risk. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your passwords and any account information.
WHAT CHOICES DO YOU HAVE ABOUT YOUR INFORMATION?
You may choose to:
Stop receiving promotional materials by mail, telephone, text message, or email;
Update and correct your personal information;
Request a copy of the information we have collected about you once per year;
Cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information.
You may contact us to make any of the choices listed above by:
Sending an email to us at guestservice@flemingssteakhouse.com; or
Providing written notification to us at the address in the Contact Us section below; or
You may also opt out of promotional emails by using the “Unsubscribe“ link in the email.
We will only send text messages to those who have expressly opted in to receiving communications by text message. You may opt out of receiving further text messages by sending a reply text with the word “Stop“ or by contacting us by email or mail as described above.
Customers who request not to be contacted will not receive offers for savings by mail/email, will be excluded from Fleming's general mailing lists, will not be automatically entered in contests and sweepstakes, and may not receive other notices. This opt-out does not apply to certain operational communications (for example, confirmation of delivery address or restaurant reservations), to the extent permitted by law.
Under rare circumstances Fleming's may need to contact some or all users to relay important information about our website or restaurants. Members are not able to unsubscribe or “opt in/opt out“ of these announcements because they may contain very important information regarding their accounts. Fleming's reserves the right to contact users to correct account errors or to supply important information Fleming's deems relevant.
HOW DO YOU CORRECT OR UPDATE YOUR INFORMATION?
You may change certain personal information or request that we delete your personal information by:
Logging-in to your account and then entering or updating your personal information;

Please include your current contact information, the information you are interested in accessing, and your requested changes. We will provide access and make the changes you request, or provide an explanation of what actions we will be able to make in response to your request.
When you ask us to delete your personal information, we may need to retain a record of certain personal information to comply with applicable federal, state or local law.
