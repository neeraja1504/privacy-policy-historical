FLEXOFFERS.COM PRIVACY POLICY
This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) is effective June 9, 2018.
FlexOffers.com, LLC (hereafter referred to as “FlexOffers.com,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) operates the website https://flexoffers.com and its subdomains (“Site,” “Website,” or “Websites”). We offer online advertising services (“Service” or “Services”) to Advertisers (“Clients”) and Publishers (“Vendors”) and have relationships with other third-party service providers. All these third parties may be collectively referred to as Partners within this Policy. By visiting a FlexOffers.com website or sharing any information with us, you agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy. If you have any questions about this Policy, please Contact Us.
Our Services are not intended for anyone under the age of 18, and we do not knowingly collect information from such persons. If you are a parent or guardian whose child under 18 has provided us with personal information without your permission, please contact us so that we can take steps to locate and remove that information from our servers.
WHAT WE COLLECT AND WHY
By providing our Services, we may collect non-personally identifiable information (“Non-PII”) about your browser, location, operating system, and the device you are using to view our site and make use of our services.

We do not collect personally identifying information (“PII”) such as name, address, phone number, or email address unless you voluntarily provide it to us.
