We share the minimum amount of personal information required to perform these functions, and these third parties will only use your information to the extent necessary to perform these functions.

Security
When you give us personal information, we take steps to ensure that it’s treated securely. Any sensitive information is encrypted.
While we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your information, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.

How do we store your information?
Except where otherwise expressly agreed, your personal information which we collect is sent to and stored on secure servers within the European Economic Area (EEA). This storage is necessary in order to process the information.
Personal information submitted may be transferred by us to our other offices and/or to the third parties mentioned in the circumstances described above (see “Who has access to your information”), which may be situated outside the EEA and may be processed by staff operating outside the EEA. The countries concerned may not have similar data protection laws to the EEA.
Where personal data is transferred in relation to providing our services, we will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is subject to appropriate safeguards, such as relying on a recognized legal adequacy mechanism which may include entering into EC approved standard contractual clauses relevant to transfers of personal information (see http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/index_en.htm ) and ensuring that your personal data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.
By using Flourish, you agree to this storing, processing and/or transfer.
How long do we keep your information?
If you ask us to delete your account, any project or profile information, plus any templates created by you that are not being used by other users, will be deleted immediately. However, templates created by you that are already being used by other users may continue to be available to those users.
If we delete your account for other reasons - such as a missed payment on a paid account - we will continue to store all projects, profile information and templates for a minimum period of 2 years after closure of an account, in order to allow the account to be reactivated without any data loss. We reserve the right to delete all templates, profile information and projects at the end of this period, or sooner on request from the company administrator who controls the account.
