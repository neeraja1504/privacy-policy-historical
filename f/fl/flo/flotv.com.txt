We recognize that you may have concerns regarding the information that we obtain about you. This statement describes what data about you that we collect, what we do with it, and what choices you can make.
Scope
This statement applies to data and information that we or our agents collect through the flotv.com web site, any other web site on which we or our distributors post a direct link to this privacy statement, as well as through the FLO TV service.   This statement does not apply to any other data collection or processing, including, without limitation, data collection practices of other web pages to which we link (but do not display a direct link to from this statement), data that we or our affiliates collect offline or through web sites that do not display a direct link to this statement or to any personal data that we process on behalf of wireless carriers and other data controllers in connection with the FLO TV service. Occasionally, we may refer to this statement in notices and consent requests related to requests for information or other agreements or terms and conditions; under such circumstances, this statement applies as modified in said agreements, terms and conditions, notices or consent requests (e.g., with respect to types of data collected or purposes of collection).

We may collect certain information when you visit our web sites or register to use our services as well as information that is made available to us solely by virtue of our relationship with you, including, without limitation, information about the quantity, technical configuration, type, destination and amount of your use of this site or the FLO TV service. Examples include but are not limited to the following:
Use of our Products & Services. We may automatically collect certain types of information or data from your device when you use our services.  For example, when you watch the FLO TV service on your device or when you connect your device to the Internet, we may  automatically collect information about how you use our service including, without limitation, (i) activation, deactivation and subscription changes, (ii) date, time, duration and content viewed, (iii) how often and when you tune in to watch the FLO TV service on your device, (iv) your parental controls, (v) your “MyMedia” files, as applicable to your device, (vi) viewing of presentation events, such as changes to screen modes and interruption due to other features, (vii) what types of media files you are storing on your device and your total tune-in time and (viii) other site or FLO TV service impacting events such as delivery failures, time zone changes and system initiated transactions.  This information may be collected when you watch the FLO TV service, or it may be transmitted to our servers after-the-fact when you connect your device to your computer or the Internet.

Sweepstakes, Contests & Surveys. From time to time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in sweepstakes, contests or other promotions promoted on our website or through mail, email, Short Message Service (sms) or Multi-Media Service (mms) text messaging or in person or other campaigns, which might be sponsored or conducted by FLO TV Incorporated or by a third party. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these promotions is completely voluntary and you will have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information. Except as explained otherwise in the official rules for a particular contest, giveaway, or promotion, such as in a paragraph entitled "Privacy Notice" or similar, any personal information you provide will be used in accordance with this provision.

Cookies: When you visit our sites, we use technology that many other web sites employ, including, without limitation, "cookies" or small data files stored on your computer's hard drive and your device, to identify you as you navigate around our Site and to enhance and personalize your experience. We may also work with third-party advertising companies and affiliates that use cookies to help us or them display relevant advertising to you when you visit our site and other sites, and when you use the FLO TV service.  These cookies also help us measure the performance of the advertising campaigns that we and the third party advertising companies may display on our site or through the FLO TV service.   In some instances, we also use cookies to collect information in connection with future visits to the site, to recognize you as a previous visitor and to track your activity at the site.
