How Secure Is Information About Me?
It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer or other internet access device. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer. Your e-mails to us are not necessarily secure against interception so do not include sensitive information in them - we generally will not ask for passwords or the like in an email and you should assume that if you get such a request, it might be fraudulent.
You agree not to use or access our Website if you (or anyone else whose information you enter) desire a higher level of security than we describe in this Privacy Policy or if you have not obtained any appropriate consents.
We do not guarantee security. Neither people nor security systems are foolproof, including encryption systems, and people can commit intentional crimes, make mistakes or fail to follow policies. You assume the risk of any inadequacy or failure of security and agree to do what you reasonably can to promote security. If applicable law imposes any non-disclaimable duty (if any), you agree that the standard used to measure our compliance with that duty will be one of intentional misconduct.
What Information Can I Access?
We give you access to certain information about you for the limited purpose of viewing and, in certain cases, updating that information. To view or change this information, log-in to your account. When you update information, we usually keep a copy of the prior version for our records.
