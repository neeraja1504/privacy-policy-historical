Florida Credit Union’s Privacy Policy
What does Florida Credit Union do with your personal information?
Financial companies choose how they share your personal information. Federal law gives consumers the right to limit some but not all sharing. Federal law also requires us to tell you how we collect, share and protect your personal information. Please read this notice carefully to understand what we do.
The types of personal information we collect and share depend on the product or service you have with us. This information can include:
Social Security Number and Income
Account Number and Payment History

When you are no longer our member, we continue to share your information as described in this notice.
All financial companies need to share members’ personal information to run their everyday business. In the section below, we list the reasons financial companies can share their members’ personal information, the reasons FCU chooses to share and whether you can limit this sharing.

Important Information about Procedures for Opening a New Account
To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. What this means for you: When you open an account, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth and other identifying documents.
You should know that credit bureaus are permitted to sell your name, address and other contact information to companies that wish to market to you their credit or insurance products or services.
You have the right to prohibit the use of your file with any credit reporting agency in connection with any transaction that you did not initiate. You may exercise this right by notifying Equifax Options, PO Box 740123, Atlanta, GA 30374-0123; TransUnion, Name Removal Option, PO Box 97328, Jackson, MS 39288; Experian Consumer OPT-OUT, 901 W. Bond, Lincoln, NE 68521; or call 1-888-5OPT-OUT (1-888-567-8688).
In addition, to stop telemarketers from calling you, you may enroll in the National Do Not Call Registry by calling 1-888-382-1222. By enrolling, telemarketers may not call you to sell goods or services unless you have a previous business relationship with them.
*Definition of affiliates: Companies related by common ownership or control. They can be financial and nonfinancial companies. Florida Credit Union has no affiliates.
** Definition of non-affiliates: Companies not related by common ownership or control. They can be financial and nonfinancial companies. Florida Credit Union only works with companies that agree to maintain strong confidentiality protections and limit the use of the information we provide to FCU use only.
