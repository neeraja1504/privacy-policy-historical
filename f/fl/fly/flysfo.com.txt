This Privacy & Cookie Policy outlines the types of information we gather when you visit flysfo.com, flysfo.cn, sfoconnect.com, sfomuseum.com, sfoconstruction.com, or any other official website of the City and County of San Francisco Airport Commission, as well as some of the steps we take to safeguard your information.
Information Collection
We do not collect personal information about you when you visit our websites unless you choose to provide that information to us.
We use cookies to collect limited non-personally identifying information your browser makes available automatically whenever you visit a website. This information includes the Internet Address of your computer, mobile device or network, the date and time of visit, pages you visit on our site, your browser and operating system, the referring page (the last webpage you visited before clicking on a link to our sites), the exit link (the next webpage you visit after clicking off of our sites), any files downloaded, any pages shared, and search terms onsite and through search engines.
We use the aggregated information from all of our visitors to measure server performance, analyze user traffic patterns and improve the content of our site.
We sometimes track the keywords that are entered into our search engine to measure interest in specific topics, but we do not track which terms a particular user enters.
Some of our online services require you to register for an account. We ask you for some personal information in order to create an account (typically your name, email address and a password for your account) and we will use that information to provide the service.
Information You Provide
Information you volunteer by completing any optional online forms, including but not limited to  our “Contact us” form, online contest forms, our “Interest in Volunteering” form, or email/newsletter subscription forms is used to help SFO enhance our services, and may be shared with City and County of San Francisco employees and contractors for that purpose.
Cookies
A “cookie” is a small text file which a webserver (for example the www.flysfo.com webserver) sends to your browser when you visit a website.
We may use “session cookies” which expire at the end of the browser session. They capture your activities during the browser session.
We may use “permanent cookies” which are saved in your browser. They collect identifying behavior such as web surfing and website preferences across multiple platforms. Cookies are stored until deleted by the user. No personal data is stored in the cookies used by SFO.
We may use "cookies" when providing personalization services. We use cookies to improve quality of our service and not to track any personal information.
The use of cookies is a standard practice among Internet websites and most Internet web browsers may be customized to reject cookies, to only accept or reject cookies by user intervention, or to delete cookies. However, some features may not function properly without cookies.
Cookies pose no risk to your computer, as they are simply text files and not executable programs.
You have the option to block or disable cookies. Using SFO’s websites without cookie functionality may not provide you with a customized experience. If you block cookies, no data will be placed on your browser and you will have to re-input your data on your next visit to SFO’s websites.
