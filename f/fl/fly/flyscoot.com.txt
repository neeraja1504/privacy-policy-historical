Part A: General Customer Data privacy policy statement
1. The types of Customer Data we collect
The types of Customer Data that Scoot collects depends on the circumstances of collection and on the nature of the service requested or transaction undertaken.
There are two broad categories of Customer Data that Scoot collects:
1) Personal Data. The data we collect includes but is not limited to:
personal information that can be used to identify an individual, such as name, gender, date of birth, passport or other personal identification numbers;
contact information, such as address, phone number, email address;
payment information, such as credit or debit card information, including the name of cardholder, card number, billing address and expiry date;
travel information, such as ticket numbers, destinations, flight information;
information on your other purchases made through Scoot, such as tracking your purchases of selectable seats, check-in baggage, seat upgrades, and purchases of travel-related services like travel insurance and WiFi data through our website;
your customer preferences, such as dietary, seating, places that you would like to visit or other service preferences;
information about your interactions with our ground and call centre staff, such as the details of any complaint cases, incidences of lost baggage, call details, and other information relevant to assist our ground or call centre staff to service you;
health information, such as doctors’ notes and requests related to medical conditions;
and
business contact information, such as the contact details of the employees of our vendors and corporate customers, as well as the contact details collected by our ultimate holding company (“Singapore Airlines Limited”) and its subsidiaries (the “SIA group”).
2) Technical Data. As further explained in Part B, this includes device and technical information you give us when using our website or mobile application (“Website”).
For purposes of this policy statement, Customer Data means Personal Data and Technical Data.
We also use Customer Data to derive Statistical Data, such as the number of passengers. This is processed and stored purely for analytical purposes, and is entirely anonymous. This information will not be stored to your customer record, and will only be aggregated for statistical analysis so that we can better understand Scoot's customer profile and improve Scoot's service offering.
Special categories of information or “sensitive personal data”
Certain categories of Customer Data, such as information about your race, ethnicity, religion or health, are considered special categories of information, or “sensitive personal data” under the GDPR.
Generally, we try to limit the circumstances where we collect your sensitive personal data. However, this can occasionally occur because you have made certain requests in connection with your travel arrangements that reveal or suggest something about you that could be considered “sensitive personal data”, or if you otherwise choose to provide such information to us (or a third party such as the travel agent through which you made your booking).
For example:
if you request a particular type of meal, e.g. halal or kosher meals, this may imply or suggest that you are a member of a particular religion; or
if you request specific medical assistance from us and/or an airport operator, e.g. the provision of a wheelchair, this may reveal that you have a particular medical condition.
How we collect data from you
Scoot collects Customer Data, either directly from you or from your authorised representatives (i.e. persons whom you have authorised and/or persons who have been validly identified as being your authorised representative (e.g. your organisation’s corporate travel manager) pursuant to our then-current security procedures.
Scoot also collects Customer Data from third parties which are located in various countries. This includes, but is not limited to, travel agents, our service providers, other airlines including those in the SIA group, to facilitate travel on code share or multi-airline flights, through our Website, mobile services, your interactions with us on our social media websites and other channels including our airport operations.
Where you make reservations on behalf of another person, you undertake and will ensure that the individual whose Customer Data is supplied to Scoot has authorised the disclosure, is informed of and agrees to the provisions of this Privacy Policy.
2. Is the provision of Customer Data required?
The collection of the following types of Customer Data is mandatory to enable Scoot to fulfil our contract of carriage with you. These types of Customer Data are marked as mandatory on our booking form. If you do not provide this information, you will not be able to book flights on our airlines and we will not be able to provide you with our services and/or products required.
Passenger details, e.g title, first/given name, last/family name, date of birth, whether you are residing in the EU or Switzerland..

Payment details, e.g. the name on the credit or debit card, the number, expiry date and security code on the credit or debit card, and billing address.
Additional information may be mandatory if you are flying to a specific country, or if you are flying on behalf of a business registered in a specific country, e.g. your gender, nationality, passport number, the country of issue of your passport, the name, GST registration number and address of the business you are flying on behalf of, and your business email address and phone number. For example, if you are flying a route that touches Honolulu, your country of birth, passport number, the country of issue of your passport and your passport expiry date is required. If you have purchased travel insurance through our web portals and, are travelling from Taiwan, your Taiwan ID is required, travelling from China, your passport ID is required. These mandatory fields will be clear when you make a booking.

These types of Customer Data are marked as mandatory on our sign up form. If you do not provide this information, you will not be able to benefit from the utility, promotions and engagement exclusive to members holding a Scoot Insider profile.
The failure to supply the following types of Customer Data will result in (i) Scoot being unable to update you on our latest products and/or launches; and/or (ii) your inability to enter or participate in contests, promotions or redemption activities organised by Scoot: Contact Information e.g. name, email address, telephone number (to verify your country of residence), and address (if the prize need to be mailed).

By using the Scoot Website, you consent to Scoot’s use of cookies to collect and use your personal data in order to collect Website usage data, and improve your online experience.
This can include information about the way you use the Website, your choice of internet browser, the type of device you are accessing it from, and where you are in the world.

Online behavioural advertising
Online behavioural advertising (also known as interest-based advertising) is a way of serving advertisements on the websites visited by you and making them more relevant to your interests. Shared interests are grouped together based upon previous web browsing activity in order for you to be served advertising which matches your shared interests. In this way, advertising can be made as relevant and useful as possible. Relevant ads can also be delivered based upon the website content you have just been viewing. This is known as ‘retargeting’. If you do not wish to be targeted for behavioural advertising, you may opt out of cookie use by following the instructions under the section “Accepting the use of cookies” below. Opting out does not mean you will no longer receive online advertising. It does mean that the company or companies from which you opted out will no longer deliver adverts tailored to your web preferences and usage patterns, so you may see a greater number of adverts that are irrelevant to you and your preferences.
