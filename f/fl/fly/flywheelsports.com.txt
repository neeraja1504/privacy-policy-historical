If you are logged in, we may associate that information with your account. We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. "Web Beacons") in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients. We may also use your email address to send updates, newsletters or other news regarding Flywheel. Users may choose not to receive email of these types by following opt-out instructions contained in such emails or by changing their notification settings under the "My Account" section of the Flywheel website.

Cookie and tracking technology are useful for gathering information such as browser type and operating system, tracking the number of visitors to the website, and understanding how visitors use the website. Cookies can also help customize our website for visitors.

We may share information with governmental agencies or other companies assisting us in fraud prevention or investigation.

The information is not provided to these companies for marketing purposes.

All marketing emails and newsletters from this site allow you to opt out of further marketing mailings.
We use industry-standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information (such as firewalls and secure sockets layer software) where appropriate. Nevertheless, absolute security does not yet exist on the internet.
