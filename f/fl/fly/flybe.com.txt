We provide you with choices about marketing and advertising that you receive from us and third party Tourism Marketing Partners.
We have established a Preference Centre where you can view and make certain decisions about how we use your Personal Information.
A welcome email will be sent to you once you have opted in to receive marketing from us.
Within the Preference Centre you can select your marketing preferences.  If you do not wish to receive marketing information from us you can opt-out by sending an email to unsubscribe@flybe.com.
We will get your explicit consent before we share your Personal Information with any company outside the Flybe group of companies or franchises described in Section 7.2 above for marketing purposes.
9.    PROFILING
We may use the Personal Information (including Technical Data) that we collect about you to create a profile about you in order to suggest flights, services and offers that may interest you.
We will only send this to you by electronic means if you have explicitly consented to receive such information in our Preference Centre.
Please use the Preference Centre to manage your preferences.
10.    INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS
Some of our Code Share Partners or another airline operator (in the circumstances described above) are based outside the European Economic Area (EEA).
Where this is the case, your Personal Information will be processed in accordance with the applicable carrier’s privacy policy and, if your booking is made via a reservation system provider (Global Distribution System (GDS)), with its privacy policy.  These are available at http://www.iatatravelcenter.com/privacy or from the applicable carrier or GDS provider directly.  You should read this documentation, which applies to your booking and specifies, for example, how your Personal Information is collected, stored, used, disclosed and transferred.
Whenever we transfer your Personal Information outside of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
We will only transfer your Personal Information to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission.  For further details, see European Commission: Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries.
Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe.  For further details, see European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries.
Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US.  For further details, see European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield.
The Glossary also lists those third parties.  Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your Personal Information out of the EEA.
11.    DATA SECURITY
We use technical and organisational measures to safeguard your Personal Information, for example, we process all payment card transactions in accordance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard and use secure connections on our website and our app to ensure that your Personal Information is encrypted.  In terms of the latter, this means that we convert your Personal Information into a computer code, which will make it harder for hackers to access your Personal Information on our website or our app. If you want to know how we are keeping your data secure, please contact our Data Protection Officer who can provide more details.
While we will use all reasonable efforts to safeguard your Personal Information, you acknowledge that the use of the internet is not entirely secure and for this reason we cannot guarantee the security or integrity of any Personal Information that are transferred from you or to you via the internet.  If you have any particular concerns about your Personal Information, please contact our Data Protection Officer using the contact details provided below.
12.    DATA RETENTION
We will only retain your Personal Information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your Personal Information, the purposes for which we process your Personal Information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
Details of retention periods for different aspects of your Personal Information are available from us on request to our Data Protection Officer.  We shall keep your Personal Information relating to Advanced Passenger Information for a period 10 years from the date when you first provided us with a copy of such Personal Information.

Your right
|
Description
---|---
Request access to your Personal Information
|
This enables you to receive a copy of the Personal Information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
Request correction of the Personal Information that we hold about you
|
You can require us to correct any mistakes in your information which we hold free of charge.
If you would like to do this, please let us have enough information to identify you (e.g. account number, user name, registration details) and let us know the information that is incorrect and what it should be replaced with.
Request erasure of your Personal Information
|
This enables you to ask us to delete or remove Personal Information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it.
You can ask us to erase your Personal Information where:
you do not believe that we need your Personal Information in order to process it for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy;
if you had given us consent to process your Personal Information, you withdraw that consent and we cannot otherwise legally process your Personal Information;
you object to our processing and we do not have any legitimate interests that mean we can continue to process your Personal Information; or
your Personal Information has been processed unlawfully or have not been erased when it should have been.
Object to processing of your Personal Information
|
Where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms.
You also have the right to object where we are processing your Personal Information for direct marketing purposes.
In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
Request restriction of processing of your Personal Information.
|
This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your Personal Information in the following scenarios:
if you want us to establish the Personal Information’s accuracy;
where our use of the Personal Information is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it;
where you need us to hold the Personal Information even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or
you have objected to our use of your Personal Information but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
Request the transfer of your Personal Information to you or to a third party.
|
We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your Personal Information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.
This right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your Personal Information.
|
This will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.
If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain flights or services to you.  We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
Please be aware that there are exceptions and exemptions that apply to some of the rights, which we will apply in accordance with Data Protection Law.
