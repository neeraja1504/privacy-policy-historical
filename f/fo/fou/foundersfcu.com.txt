Other Important Information
Notices and “Joint Relationships.” Except where expressly required by applicable law, we will provide all notices to the person
(member) listed first on any application, agreement or other relevant document with us. The notice will be mailed to the address
noted for said person on the application, agreement or other document. If this person (member) has agreed to receive notices and
disclosures electronically, then we can send all such notices and notifications, to the e-mail or Internet address provided by said
person; or we shall post or otherwise give notice by posting a notice, providing a link or using such other electronic methods
authorized under applicable laws and/or regulations. All joint owners, borrowers and guarantors agree to the receipt and sufficiency
of any notice or notification sent according to this paragraph.
Modification. The Credit Union reserves the right to modify, change or amend this Privacy Policy and Agreement at any time without
notice other than as expressly required by applicable law.
What members can do to help. Protect your account numbers, card numbers, PINs (personal identification numbers), and
passwords. In particular, never keep your PIN with your debit card or credit card, as that makes you vulnerable in the event you
lose your card or your card is stolen. Use caution in revealing account numbers, social security numbers, etc. to other persons. In
particular, if a caller tells you he/she is calling you on behalf of the credit union and asks for your account number, you should beware.
Legitimate credit union staff would already have access to that information. It’s important that the credit union has current information
about how to reach you. If we detect potentially fraudulent use of your account, we will attempt to contact you immediately. If your
address or phone number changes, please let us know.
Protecting Children. We do not knowingly solicit or collect data from children and we do not knowingly market to children online.
We recognize that protecting children’s identities and online privacy is important and that responsibility rests with us and with parents.
