To make this site work properly, we sometimes place small data files called cookies on your device. Most big websites do this too.
What are cookies?
A cookie is a small text file that a website saves on your computer or mobile device when you visit the site. It enables the website to remember your actions and preferences (such as login, language, font size, and other display preferences) over some time, so you don’t have to keep re-entering them whenever you come back to the site or browse from one page to another.
How do we use cookies?
_This site is hosted by WordPress.com, and as such it  _makes use of cookies for a variety of different purposes.
