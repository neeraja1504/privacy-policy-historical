Under certain circumstances, you have the following rights in relation to your personal data:
•    The right of access to your personal data: This enables you to receive a copy of the personal
information we hold about you and check that we are lawfully processing it.
•    The right to have your personal data rectified: This enables you to have any incomplete or
inaccurate information we hold about you corrected.
•    The right to deletion of your personal data: This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal
information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it, you withdraw your
consent, we are unlawfully holding your personal data or we should erase your personal data to
comply with applicable EU law. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal
information where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below).
•    The right to object to processing of your personal data: This applies where we are relying on a
legitimate interest (or those of a third party) as a legal basis for our processing and there is
something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this
ground. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for
direct marketing purposes.
•    The right to restriction of processing of your personal data: This enables you to ask us to suspend
the processing of personal data about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or
stop us deleting personal data which you need for a legal claim.
•    The right to have your data transferred to another services provider: This enables you to have the
personal data you have provided us to be transferred to another party.
You can exercise your rights at any time by contacting us at legal@foundry.com and providing
sufficient information for us to identify you and your personal data.
We will always aim to help you when you wish to exercise your rights but in some instances we may
have lawful grounds to reject your request depending on the legal reason why we collected your
personal data. You will, though, always have the right to be informed about the information we
collect about you.
We will investigate any request you make without undue delay and in any event within one month of
receipt of your request. That period may be extended by two further months where necessary, taking
into account the complexity and number of requests. We shall inform you of any such extension
within one month of receipt of the request, together with the reasons for the delay.
In the event that we decide to not take action on the request, we will inform you of the reasons for
not taking action.
