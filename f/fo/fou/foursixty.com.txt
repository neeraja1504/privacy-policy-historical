Online Interest-Based Advertising
We work with third-parties such as ad networks and other advertising companies that use their own tracking technologies (including cookies, tracer tags, web beacons and pixel tags) on the Website in order to provide you with tailored advertisements on our behalf across the Internet (including on social media websites). These companies may collect information about your activity across your different devices on our Website and third-party websites (such as web pages you visit and your interaction with our advertising) and use this information to deliver ads that are more relevant and tailored to you on our Website and third party websites. This information may also be used to evaluate our online advertising campaigns
We adhere to the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada’s (DAAC) Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioural Advertising. To learn more about this interest-based advertising practice and to understand your options, including how you can opt-out of receiving interest-based ads from participating third-party advertising companies, please  visit the Digital Advertising Alliance website at http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada website at www.youradchoices.ca/choices.
To successfully opt-out, you must have cookies enabled in your web browser. Please see your browser’s instructions for information on cookies and how to enable them. Your opt-out only applies to the web browser you use so you must opt-out of each web browser on each device that you use. Once you opt out, if you delete your browser’s saved cookies, you may need to opt-out again.
Please note that even if you opt-out interest-based advertising by a third party, these tracking technologies may still collect data for other purposes including analytics and you will still see ads from us, but the ads will not be targeted based on behavioural information about you and may therefore be less relevant to you and your interests.

When individuals engage with our content on or through third-party social networking websites, plug-ins and applications, they may allow us to have access to certain information associated with their social media account (e.g., name, username, email address, profile picture, gender) to deliver the content or as part of the operation of the website, plug-in or application.
