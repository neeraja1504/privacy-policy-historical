PRIVACY POLICY
Your privacy is important to us. We have created this Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) to notify you how we treat personally identifiable information and other information that we collect and store. This Policy applies only to information collected by kdvr.com (the “Site”) and does not protect information you post to public areas on the Site. This Policy is not a contract between you and us, and this Policy imposes no duties on us not imposed by state or federal law.
The Site is owned and operated by Local TV, LLC, dba KDVR Television.
Any inquiries about this Policy should be directed to:

This Policy is incorporated by reference into the Terms and Conditions of Use Agreement to which you agreed upon entering the Site.
How we gather information from users:
The information we learn from you helps us personalize and improve your experience at the Site. The following are the types of information we gather:
Information You Voluntarily Give Us: We receive information when you register for the Site, sign up for membership, request certain features, or make a purchase. Additionally, you may provide information when you participate in sweepstakes or contests, voting and polling activities, and other interactive areas of the Site. Any personally identifiable information you provide is voluntary. This personal data (such as age and gender) may be used to create personalized content, services, and advertising on our Site, as well as to better understand your preferences. The Site may combine information that you voluntarily give us with information provided by third parties and affiliates.
Please note: Determinations of eligibility for contests or sweepstakes will be made without regard to a contestant’s race, sex, religion, marital status, sexual orientation, national origin, veteran status, or any other status protected by law.
E-mail / Opt-Out: When we ask for your personally identifiable information, such as email address, to share with our third party promotional partners or non-affiliated advertisers, you have the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of providing such information. During the registration process or at other places on the Site, you may have the opportunity to indicate areas about which you would like to receive more information. Participation in any of these programs is at your option, and you will not be enrolled automatically in any of these programs. If you opt-in, you may opt out at any time if you change your mind by logging into your profile and changing your email preferences, if applicable.
Automatic Information: We automatically receive and record certain types of information whenever you interact with us. This information, which is recordable any time you use the Internet, includes the Internet Protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet; your domain name, if any; and computer and connection information, such as browser type and version. In addition, like many Web sites, we use a technology called “cookies” to record your activity while visiting the Site. We use this information to learn how you use the Site, to remember your preferences, and to diagnose problems.
Aggregated Usage Information: We may provide aggregated usage information to third parties, such as content licensors and advertisers, for diagnostic, billing and sales purposes. However, such information will not include any personally identifiable user information. This information is purely statistical in nature and cannot be tied to you.
Links & Advertisements: To better serve you, we may provide you with external links to other sites which we believe can offer you useful information and services. Any external (non-kdvr.com) Web sites to which we provide links are subject to their own privacy policies, and you will need to review those policies. We have no control over or responsibility for the privacy practices of any external sites. Additionally, we use third-party technology to serve advertisements to you and allow third parties to access their own cookies on your computer. Use of cookies by third parties is subject to their own privacy policies and not this Policy.
More Information about Cookies. Cookies are small text files placed on your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser that enable us to personalize your Web browsing experience. The “help” portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, disabling cookies may prevent you from taking full advantage of some of the features on the Site.
Do We Share Your Personal Information?
In addition to the third-party sharing discussed above, the Site may share your personal information as follows:
We may rent, sell, or share personally identifiable information about you with third parties only in order to provide services or products that you have requested; when we have your permission; or as otherwise described in this Policy.
We may share your information with our affiliates or agents in order to provide services or communicate with you on our behalf.
We will disclose information if required by law, such as in response to a subpoena or similar legal process, or as necessary to enforce the Terms and Conditions of Use for the Site. If we or substantially all of our assets are acquired, user information may be one of the transferred assets. We will not be liable for your information no longer in our possession.
We cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Policy. By way of example, without limiting the foregoing, we may be forced to disclose personal information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications.
How Is The Collected Information Protected?
We use state-of-the-art technology to protect your data from unauthorized third parties. Currently, we use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) software to protect your personal data. SSL encrypts personal information as it is transmitted over the Internet. We use firewalls between our internal network and the Web to allow only clearly defined traffic to access specific services. The Site is registered with a site identification authority that enables your browser to confirm our identity before you send any information.
During the registration process, we use a server ID (or a digital certificate) together with industry-standard 128-bit SSL encryption to protect sensitive Member information, if any, during both transmission and storage. You can confirm the presence of security measures when transmitting data through your security-enabled browser by looking for: A URL beginning with “https://” rather than “http://”. If you’re using Microsoft Internet Explorer® or Mozilla Firefox®, a closed lock icon at the bottom of the browser window.
Privacy Rights of California Residents. If you are a California resident, you are entitled to additional privacy rights under California law. If you submit a written request to the address above, kdvr.com will provide you with a California Customer Choice Notice that you may use to opt-out of third party personal information sharing. Please specify on your request that you are seeking your “California Customer Choice Notice” and allow at least 30 days for a response.
How Do I Learn More About The Information Collected?
If you have any questions or concerns about the information collected about you or this Policy, please contact us at the following email address: webmaster@kdvr.com.
When you use the Site, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required.
We allow third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect certain anonymous information when you visit our web site.  These companies may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of interest to you.  These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information.
To learn or more about this behavioral advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising for some companies, you can visit http://www.networkadvertising.org and http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp
