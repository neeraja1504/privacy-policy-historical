Privacy Policy
Effective January 18, 2013
Overview
Fox Creek Leather will not spam you. Your personal information will not be used for any purpose other than to process your order. If requested we will add your e-mail address to our newsletter mailing list. We will never share, sell, or rent our mailing list. Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. Fox Creek Leather knows how vital your personal information is and how important that you know all ways your information is used and shared. This notice describes our privacy policy. We share customer information only as described below. By visiting www.foxcreekleather.com, you accept the terms of this notice.
What information does Fox Creek Leather collect?
The information we learn from visitors to foxcreekleather.com helps determine the types of products we offer and helps us improve our products and website. The types of information we gather:
Personal Information
When you place an order with us we will ask you for your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address. You may choose to provide your credit card information to make a payment or you may send us a money-order, bank wire transfer, or pay via paypal instead. Your information will only be used to process your order and such purposes as responding to your requests and communicating with you.
Automatic Information:
Some information we collect and analyze includes the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet; computer and connection information such as browser type, version, and time zone setting, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system, and platform; the full Uniform Resource Locator (URL) clickstream to, through, and from our Web site, including date and time; cookie number; products you viewed or searched for; and the phone number you used to call our 800 number. We may also use browser data such as cookies, Flash cookies (also known as Flash Local Shared Objects), or similar data on certain parts of our Web site for fraud prevention and other purposes. During some visits we may use software tools such as JavaScript to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away from the page.
Mobile:
When you access www.foxcreekleather.com, we may receive information about your location and your mobile device, including a unique identifier for your device. Most mobile devices provide users with the ability to disable location services. Most likely, these controls are located in the device's settings menu. If you have questions about how to disable your device's location services, we recommend you contact your mobile service carrier or your device manufacturer.
E-mail:
We often receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from foxcreekleather.com if your computer supports such capabilities. When you contact us through foxcreekleather.com or email us, you are communicating with us electronically. Should you contact us by email, we may reply to you by email or by telephone. You have the option to sign up for our e-newsletter which offers an unsubscribe link in every issue. You will never receive unsolicited “spam” emails. You agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing.
Choice/Opt-out
We provide you the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having your e-mail address added to our newsletter mailing list. When placing an order or recommending a product you can choose to uncheck the box requesting that your e-mail address be added to our mailing list. If you are a newsletter subscriber and no longer wish to receive our newsletter, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or by emailing us at customerservice (at) foxcreekleather.com.
You will be notified if your personal information is collected by any third party that is not our agent/service provider, so you can make an informed choice as to whether or not to share your information with that party.

If you choose to visit foxcreekleather.com, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Notice and our Terms of Use, including limitations on damages, resolution of disputes, and application of the law of the commonwealth of Virginia. If you have any concern about privacy at foxcreekleather.com, please contact us with a thorough description, and we will try to resolve it.

We may e-mail periodic reminders of our notices and conditions, but you should check our Web site frequently to see recent changes. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Notice applies to all information that we have about you and your account.

Cookies
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.
We use persistent cookies to enable shopping cart, to track Web site use, and for remarketing purposes. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file. You may find more information about cookies at http://www.cookiecentral.com/faq/.
The Help feature on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the Web site of its manufacturer. Because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of foxcreekleather.com's essential features, we recommend that you leave them turned on. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be able to add items to your Shopping Cart, proceed to Checkout, or make an online purchase.
Clear Gifs
Our third party advertising partners employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information.
Security
The security of your personal information is important to us. All information entered throughout the checkout process is encrypted using secure socket layer technology (SSL). Our SSL certificate is issued by Comodo. At no point in time do we transfer your information over a non encrypted connection.
However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can send email us at customerservice (at) foxcreekleather.com. Typically you can expect an email or telephone reply within one business day.
If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should contact customer service at Fox Creek Leather by e-mail at customerservice (at) foxcreekleather.com or by phone at 1-800-766-4165.
Business Transitions
In the event Fox Creek Leather goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.
Changes in this Privacy Statement
If we change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
