5. Transfer of Information to the U.S. and Other Countries  Top
We may transfer your personal information across national borders to other countries in compliance with applicable laws.
Where Fotolia transfers your personal information from the EEA to a country which is not within the EEA and is not subject to an adequacy decision by the EU Commission, we rely on one or more of the following legal mechanisms: EU Commission approved Standard Contractual Clauses, a vendor's binding corporate rules, and your consent. A copy of the relevant mechanism can be provided for your review upon request, using the contact details provided at the end of this Privacy Policy.
Where provided by applicable law, you have the right to ask us for a copy of your personal data; to correct, delete or restrict (stop any active) processing of your personal data; and to obtain the personal data you provide to us for a contract or with your consent in a structured, machine readable format, and to ask us to share (port) this data to another controller. Wherever we rely on your consent, you will always be able to withdraw that consent, although we may have other legal grounds for processing your data for other purposes, such as those set out above.
In addition, you can object to the processing of your personal data in some circumstances (in particular, where we don’t have to process the data to meet a contractual or other legal requirement, or where we are using the data for direct marketing).
These rights may be limited, for example if fulfilling your request would reveal personal data about another person, or if you ask us to delete information which we are required by law to keep or have compelling legitimate interests in keeping (such as fraud prevention purposes, to defend claims, or protect legal rights).
You may review or change the information you provide to us by going to the "My Profile" section of the Website. If you wish to delete your information or deactivate your account, contact us via telephone or the “Contact Us” form on the Website.
To exercise any of these rights (including deactivating your Fotolia account), you can get in touch with us using the details set out below. If you have unresolved concerns, you have the right to complain to an EU data protection authority where you live, work or where you believe a breach may have occurred.
To register with Fotolia, to create an Fotolia account, and to use the Fotolia website, products or services, the provision of some information is mandatory: if relevant information is not provided, then we will not be able to administer a Fotolia account to you, or provide you with the websites, apps, products or services requested. All other provision of your information is optional. Providing optional information will help us offer you a better experience, such as more personalized or tailored content or offerings.
Withdrawing consent or otherwise objecting to direct marketing?
We and companies we hire to help us market our websites and apps on our behalf may use your information to provide you with information and offers related to Fotolia.
Wherever we rely on your consent, you will always be able to withdraw that consent, although we may have other legal grounds for processing your information for other purposes, such as those set out above. In some cases, we are able to send you direct marketing without your consent, where we rely on our legitimate interests.

How long will you retain my data?
Where we process registration data, we do this for as long as you are an active user of our websites, apps or products. When you close your account, we delete certain personal information that we no longer have a business reason to retain, such as your hashed password and your payment account data. However, we typically retain personal information related to our contract and business transactions with you for seven years after your last interaction with us. Where you have perpetually licensed content to us – or have perpetually licensed content from us – we need to keep a record of that in perpetuity for license and royalty management purposes. Model and property releases also are kept in perpetuity (as certain content rights are perpetual) for licensing the content, investigating, preventing legal claims, and to protect third party rights. We also keep our contributor’s bank details so we can verify that Fotolia paid the contributors for the licenses that Fotolia sold.
Where we process personal data for marketing purposes or with your consent, we process the data until you ask us to stop and for a short period after this (to allow us to implement your requests). We also keep a permanent record of the fact that you have asked us not to send you direct marketing or to process your data so that we can respect your request in future.
