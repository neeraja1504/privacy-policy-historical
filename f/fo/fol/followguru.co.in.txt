This Privacy Policy sets out our practices with respect to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information in connection with  Follwo Guru  Site.
This Privacy Policy may be updated by us at any time by posting on the site without any prior notice. Also, this Privacy Statement may be supplemented or modified by agreements entered into between us and an individual from time to time.
In this Privacy Statement, personal information means any information about an identifiable individual, including contact and demographic details, not including collective information or information regarding a group in summarized form.
Who may process data?
Your personal information (which includes your name, address and any other details you provide to us which concern you as an individual) may be processed both by us and by other companies within our group and also by educational employers.
Processing your information as mentioned above will be done in accordance with this privacy policy and with your authorization by email in each case.
Purpose of processing:
We will use your information for the purpose of matching CV details to educational vacancy requirements, fulfilling orders placed by you, processing any other transactions authorized or made by you with us, informing you of updates to the website services, special offers and providing other marketing information to you which we think you may find of interest (where you have checked the appropriate box on the website giving us your permission to inform you of special offers and marketing information) and undertaking product or customer research/development.
We retain all membership and profile information indefinitely. If you would like us to delete your personal information or to remove a CV that you have uploaded please send an email to support@followguru.co.in and provide details of your request.
Personal Information:
In order to operate the Site in an efficient and effective manner and provide users with information on job postings and services that may be of interest to them, Follow Guru may collect personal information, including contact information (such as an email address), from its users. In addition, this information allows us to provide users with private and secure areas to post and modify their original content on our site (e.g., jobs and CVs). We also automatically track certain information based upon your behavior on the Site and use this information to do internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand, protect and serve users in general. This information may include the URL that a user has just come from (whether this URL is on our Site or not), the URL a user goes to next (whether this URL is on our Site or not), a user’s computer browser information, and their IP address.
You agree that Follow Guru may use your personal information to contact you and deliver information to you that, in some cases, is targeted to your interests (such as relevant job postings and services), or provides administrative notices or communications applicable to your use of the Site. By accepting this Privacy Policy, you expressly agree to receive this information. If you do not wish to receive these communications, we encourage you to opt out of any further receipt by following the opt. out provisions provided in each such communication.
We do not sell our users' personal information to anyone for any reason if the user has indicated a desire for us to keep the information private. When posting jobs and CVs, our users decide for themselves how much contact information they wish to display (we enable private communication for those who choose to hide this information).
All users should be aware, however, that when they voluntarily display or distribute personal information (such as their email address or CV), that information can be collected and used by others. This may result in unsolicited messages from third parties for which Follow Guru is not responsible.
Follow Guru may also disclose specific user information when we determine that such disclosure is necessary to comply with the law, to cooperate with or seek assistance from law enforcement or to protect the interests or safety of CareerBuilder India or other users of the Site. In addition, personal information we have collected may be passed on to a third party in the event of a transfer of ownership or assets or a bankruptcy of Follow Guru.
Disclosure of Information:
We will not pass on your personal details to any third party without your express permission. This means that if you submit your CV to us, we will not send it out to colleges or recruitment agencies without your prior permission.
You can check boxes on the website agreeing to certain uses of your data (e.g. passing your details to our partners). If you check a box, we may use your data accordingly.
We may contact you from time to time to establish your current position and whether you would be interested in being put forward for any particular vacancies that are available at that time.
We may pass on the aggregated information that we have gathered about our customers to third parties but no individual details will be conveyed.
In the unlikely event that a liquidator, administrator or receiver is appointed over us or all or any part of our assets that insolvency practitioner may transfer your information to a third party purchaser of the business provided that purchaser undertakes to use your information only for the same purposes as set out in this policy.
We undertake not to provide your personal information to third parties save in accordance with this policy.
Sharing Information with Third Parties:
All personally identifiable information you provide is maintained in confidence by followguru.co.in. There are instances, however, in which you’re personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information is shared with third parties, as described below.
If you post your resume on the Site and elect to permit it to be searched by employers and staffing agencies, your resume and the personally identifiable information it contains will be accessible to them. While it is our goal that only employers or staffing agencies will gain access to resume data, we cannot guarantee that no other persons or entities will gain such access.
When you request information from followguru.co.in or one or more of our clients, we may transfer that information within followguru.co.in or route your information to our client(s), across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world, so that they may provide the information on their product or service that you requested.
We may also disclose information to an affiliate or third party who provides substantially similar services as the original service about which you requested more information. In such situations, we will provide you with an opportunity to opt-out of such sharing.
In addition to the above situations where your information may be shared with others, there is also the possibility that tedjob.com, or part(s) of the company, may one day be purchased by, or merged with, another company. In the event of such transaction, the acquiring (or merging) company will have access to all collected personally identifiable information.
Finally, followguru.co.in may share your information as necessary to comply with a court order or to cooperate with government and law enforcement officials.
