All About Data And Why We Collect It
Personal Identification Information
We may collect personally identification information from Users in a variety of ways in connection with activities, services, features or resources we make available on our Site. Users may be asked for, as appropriate, their name and email address. We will collect personal identification information from Users only if they voluntarily submit such information to us. Users can always refuse to supply personally identification information, except that it may prevent them from engaging in certain Site related activities (such as giveaways).
Personal data may be collected in a variety of ways such as contact forms, comments, cookies, analytics, and third party embeds.
Non-Personal Identification Information
Our analytics, etc., may collect non-personal identification information about Users whenever they interact with our Site. Non-personal identification information may include the browser name, the type of computer and technical information about Users means of connection to our Site, such as the operating system and the Internet service providers utilized and other similar information.
Why We Use Collected Information
Following In My Shoes collects and uses Users personal information for the following purposes:
– To administer a content, promotion, survey or other Site feature
To send Users information they agreed to receive about topics we think will be of interest to them — i.e. to notify giveaway winners.
– To send periodic emails
The email address Users provide will only be used to respond to their direct inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.
How We Collect Information
Blog Comments
At this time, we no longer allow comments on posts; if you have a question about a recipe, etc., you may email  directly.
But, with regard to past comments left before they were turned off commenting: when visitors left comments on the site, data shown in the comments form was collected, along with the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string — all of which was used to help spam detection.
An anonymized string created from those email addresses ( also called a hash ) may have been provided to the Gravatar service to see if the user was using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here: https://automattic.com/privacy/. ( After approval of those past comment, a user’s profile picture would be made visible to the public in the context of  their comment.)
Web Browser Cookies
Our Site may use “cookies” to enhance User experience. User’s web browser places cookies on their hard drive for record-keeping purposes and sometimes to track information about them. User may choose to set their web browser to refuse cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. If they do so, note that some parts of the Site may not function properly.
3rd Party Services used, such as plug-ins, may also use cookies for each user.  At this time, the following 3rd party plug-ins/services are being use on this site:
Akismet — “We collect information about visitors who comment on Sites that use our Akismet anti-spam service. The information we collect depends on how the User sets up Akismet for the Site, but typically includes the commenter’s IP address, user agent, referrer, and Site URL (along with other information directly provided by the commenter such as their name, username, email address, and the comment itself).”

Instagram saves some cookies in browsers of website visitors via API data. These cookies are mostly used for security purposes. They are regulated under terms of Instagram’s  Privacy Policy.”
Embedded Content From Other Websites
Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.
These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracing your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.
