Privacy Policy | Folger Shakespeare Library
The Folger takes your online privacy seriously. Our privacy policy is designed to let you and other Folger Website users know how we gather and use personal information we collect in connection with use of the Folger Website.
We will take reasonable steps to protect user privacy consistent with the guidelines set forth in this policy and with applicable state and federal laws. We take these precautions in an effort to protect your information against security breaches.  However, this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by a breach of our security systems.  We are not responsible for the actions of hackers and other unauthorized third parties that breach our reasonable security procedures. By using the Folger Website, you acknowledge that you understand and agree to assume these risks.
Personal Information
You may visit the Folger Website anonymously without providing any personal information (such as your name, address, or email address). The Folger does not collect personal information from individuals unless they provide it to us voluntarily and knowingly. If you ask to be added to a newsletter or other subscription list, purchase tickets, purchase items from the online store, donate to the Folger, register for free seminars and events, or use other online services at the Folger Website, we may ask you for personal information that may include your name, address, email address, phone number and credit card information including number, billing address, security code (CVV), and expiration date.
How Personal Information Is Used
With the narrow exceptions provided below, the Folger uses your personal information solely for the purpose that you provided us the information.
We may partner with third party service providers to operate and manage our online ticket sales, online store and other online services.  Occasionally we share mailing addresses with third parties offering programs we think will be of interest to our audiences. In either event, your personal information may be shared with the third party service provider and will be used and protected in accordance with the policies of that company.
In addition, we may be required to provide information to third parties, such as law enforcement authorities, to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request; to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; and to protect the rights, property or safety of the library, its users or others.  The Folger may also share your email address or other personal information with third parties for the purposes of protecting the Folger Website from fraud or from security risks, and to enforce compliance with the Folger’s privacy and other policies.

Cookies

Security and Your Credit Card Information
The Folger cares about the safety and security of your online transactions. We use a high-grade encryption key (RC4, 128 bit) and the https security protocol to communicate with your browser software. This method is the industry standard security protocol used by many financial institutions and e-commerce companies that makes it difficult for anyone to intercept the credit card information you send to us. Notwithstanding our commitments to protect your information from loss, misuse or alteration by third parties, you should be aware that there is always some risk involved in transmitting information over the Internet. There is also risk that others could find a way to thwart our security systems.
