Privacy Policy | Focus Camera
At Focus Camera Inc, the privacy and protection of your personal and financial information is very important to us. That's why we've created this privacy statement, which fully describes our information gathering and dissemination practices. It's the best way we can demonstrate our firm commitment to your privacy.
We use your IP address chiefly to identify you and your shopping cart, but also to administer our web site, to help diagnose problems with our server, and to gather broad demographic information. At Focus Camera Inc, we use cookies to keep track of your online shopping cart & its contents, and to save personal preferences that enable us to deliver content specific to your interests. The cookie itself does not tell us who you are, nor does it reveal your e-mail address or anything else personal. Even if you decline our cookies, you can still access most of the features on our site.
Our web site contains links to other sites, but we do not pass any information to those sites. Keep in mind that Focus Camera Inc is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these web sites, and you should check their privacy policies before sharing any private information with them.
Whenever you place an order with us, join our mailing list, respond to an online survey, or enter one of our competitions, you will be asked to provide contact information (e.g., name, address, e-mail address, etc.), and in the case of an order, financial data as well (e.g., credit card or account number, etc.).
Here's how we use that information:
Contact information: This is used to ship your order to you, contact you about any issue involving your order, and/or occasionally send you information about our company.
Financial data: This is used solely to bill you for merchandise purchased and/or services rendered.
All your private data is secured using SSL protocol, which safely encrypts the data before sending it to us. Also note that we never disclose your personal information to third parties, except where required by law or in order to provide you with a requested service.
Providing contact information to Focus Camera Inc indicates your permission for us to occasionally e-mail you material about our company that we believe might interest you. Of course, you can always remove your name from our mailing list or edit the contact information we have on file at your discretion. To remove your name & other contact info completely, simply e-mail us at cs@focuscamera.com with the word "Unsubscribe" in the subject line.
