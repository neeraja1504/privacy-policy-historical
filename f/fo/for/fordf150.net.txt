Information Collection
FordF150.net collects a minimum of personal information on visitors when they register for a free site membership or submit a support ticket.
When visitors register for a free membership, all that is required is a valid e-mail address and a nickname. The nickname can be basically anything (i.e. not your real name), so in essense, the minimum amount of personal information you need to provide to us is your e-mail address. You have the option to include the following: location (city/state/province), truck year/make/model, occupation, and interests. Remember these are optional items.
We do not collect personal information such as home/work address, phone numbers, etc.
We do not collect any personal information pertaining to transactions you have with sponsors or advertisers. Once you leave this site, we do not track you (e.g. if you purchase a product from an advertiser, they do not share your personal information with us or vice versa).
For all visitors, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, and the page you request.

We do not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or companies, period.
We respond to subpoenas, court orders, legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.

Cookies & Web Beacons
FordF150.net will serve at most two cookies. One for direct advertising and one for your membership.

If you're paranoid about Web cookies, beacons, and similar temporary Internet files used by advertisers, you can disable them in your browser. (See your browser's help file to learn how.) Caution: Disabling cookies can have unintended consequences, such as forcing you to log in manually when you visit forums, social-networking sites, online editions of newspapers, and other membership-based sites.
Other Information
We aren't responsible for information that may be gathered by ad networks, affiliates, or advertisers when you complete surveys or fill out order forms.
