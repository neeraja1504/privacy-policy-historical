The ads in our apps are not targeted to you based on your current GPS location, but they may be targeted to you based on your ZIP code or device's IP address.
Third Parties
Some of the services and advertisements included in BMPL , including on BMPL and within our mobile apps, are delivered or served by third-party companies, which may collect information about your use of BMPL.

For another example, an advertiser or ad server may also be able to collect your device’s unique identifier in the course of serving an ad. In many cases, this information could be used to show you ads on other websites based on your interests.
We do not have access to, nor control over, these third parties' use of cookies or other tracking technologies or how they may be used. For example, we use Google to serve advertisements onto BMPL , which use the Google Doubleclick cookie, and in some cases, a unique device identifier, to show you ads based on your visit to BMPL and other sites on the internet. You may opt out of the use of the Google Doubleclick cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy.
