Fort Lewis College Privacy Statement
Commitment to Individual Privacy
Fort Lewis College (FLC) is committed to protecting the privacy and accuracy of confidential information submitted by employees, students, and visitors. Since Fort Lewis College is a public institution, some information collected, including information gathered from the from the FLC web sites, may be subject to the Colorado Public (Open) Records Act. Thus, in some cases FLC may be compelled by law to release information gathered from our Web servers. This may include server log information, e-mail messages sent to an individual identified on the web site, and information collected from web-based forms.
Colorado Public (Open) Records Act (C.R.S. 24-72 201 et seq.)
The State of Colorado requires that all public records be open for inspection by any person at reasonable times, except as otherwise provided by law. Under the Colorado Public (Open) Records Act, all records made or maintained by a state institution such as FLC are 'public,' regardless of the format or medium of such records. Certain personal information may be protected by state and federal law. However, all information becomes a public record once it is provided and may be subject to public inspection and copying, if not protected by federal or state law.
Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (20 U.S.C. Â§1232g)
FLC complies with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), 20 U.S.C. Â§1232g, which generally prohibits the release of education records other than public directory information, without the student's permission. For more information about FERPA and the current FLC FERPA policy please see the Registrar's web site. Students who wish to have their personally identifiable information removed from the campus directory should notify the Registrar's Office.
Information Collection
It is FLC's policy to collect the least amount of personally identifiable information required to fulfill its required duties and responsibilities, to complete a particular transaction, deliver a services, or as required by state and federal law. This policy applies to the collection of all personally identifiable information, regardless of the source or medium.
For site administration functions, information, other than personal information linked to a particular individual, is collected for analysis and statistical purposes of Web site navigation. This information is used to help diagnose problems, assess what information is of most interest, determine technical design specifications, identify and manage system performance and/or problem areas, and other administration functions.

If you choose not to provide the personal information we request, you can still visit most of FLC Web sites, but you may be unable to access certain options, offers, and services that involve our interaction with you.

A breach will be determined by the following factors:
Was there unauthorized access to PII?
Was PII actually acquired?
Was the PII data unencrypted?
Has illegal or misuse of the PII data occurred?
Likelihood of reasonable harm to the individual
