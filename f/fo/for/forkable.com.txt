Forkable
Version 2.1
October 16, 2017
The Kitchens, Inc., doing business as Forkable (The Kitchens), operates its website, located at forkable.com (“Website”), provides software and services, and facilitates ordering and delivery of food from third party restaurants through a network of independent food delivery couriers (the Website software and services is collectively “Forkable”). Your privacy is important to The Kitchens and this Privacy Policy lays out The Kitchens’ policies and procedures surrounding the collection and handling of such information. This Privacy Policy applies only to websites under control of The Kitchens. It does not apply to any Food Preparation Partners’ sites, other third party services linked to Forkable or offline activities related to The Kitchens Inc.'s services. Please review this Privacy Policy with the Terms of Use, as many terms within this Privacy Policy are defined by the Terms of Use.
1. Information The Kitchens Collects
The Kitchens may collect the following personal information from users of Forkable: (1) first name, (2) last name, (2) current street address, (3) billing address, (4) delivery addresses, (5) phone number, (6) e-mail address (7) credit card information, (8) bank account information, (9) driver’s license info and (10) tax compliance information. Collectively we call this "Personally Identifiable Information" or "PII").
In addition, The Kitchens may collect information regarding past Forkable orders, favorite Food Preparation Partners, food preferences and dietary restrictions, customer service inquiries and which company(ies) or organization(s) you are affiliated and/or employed with.
The Kitchens also uses web analytics software to track and analyze traffic on Forkable in connection with The Kitchens' advertising and promotion of Forkable services. The Kitchens may publish these statistics or share them with third parties without including PII.
2. The Kitchens’ Use Of Collected Information
The Kitchens uses PII to create customers' Forkable accounts, to communicate with customers about Forkable services, to offer customers additional services, promotions and special offers and to charge for purchases made through Forkable. The Kitchens uses stored PII to facilitate orders, to customize future order processing for users, to facilitate payment, to screen Food Preparation Partners and Delivery Providers, and for tax compliance purposes. Note that, for enhanced security, The Kitchens does not store full credit card information on its own servers, but instead relies on specialized partners to store the full data, while only storing metadata on The Kitchens’servers. You may request that The Kitchens cease storing certain PII at any time, but you might not be able to take advantage of certain features of Forkable or Forkable in its entirety. The Kitchens may also use PII to enforce the Forkable Terms of Use.
For Food Preparation Partners, additional information may be requested and stored regarding your business. Additional information may be, but is not limited to: types of food served, pricing, and contact information of certain employees or your affiliates. Similarly, we may collect additional relevant information from Delivery Providers.
The Kitchens may use cookies and other persistent memory browser features to remember users of Forkable and to enhance users' experience on the Website. For example, when users with Forkable accounts return to Forkable, such features may be used to identify those users and allow Forkable to provide certain user-specific information such as Forkable account information, past orders and favorite Food Preparation Partners.
The Kitchens shares selected PII to third-party vendors and service providers who work in connection with Forkable including information to Delivery Providers (in particular location and contact information for the purpose of coordinating the delivery.) In addition, The Kitchens shares Forkable customers' order content, special order instructions, first and last name, location and telephone number with parters when orders are placed to the extent it is necessary to process those orders. Forkable may also forward names and emails to partners when addressing customer feedback. The Kitchens may also disclose information about users to third-parties where The Kitchens has a good faith belief that such disclosure is necessary in order to: (i) protect, enforce, or defend the legal rights, privacy, safety, or property of The Kitchens, its affiliates or employees, agents and contractors (including enforcement of any agreements, including Terms of Use); (ii) protect the safety, privacy, and security of users of the The Kitchens employees, owners, or members of the public; (iii) protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; (iv) comply with the law or legal process; or (v) respond to requests from public and government authorities.
3. The Kitchens' Protection of PII
The Kitchens, Inc. uses reasonable security measures to protect PII from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification and disclosure. The Kitchens takes a tiered approach to security, such that more sensitive information, like bank account numbers, is especially carefully guarded. Unfortunately, even with these measures, The Kitchens cannot guarantee the security of PII. By using Forkable, you acknowledge and agree that The Kitchens makes no such guarantee, and that you use Forkable at your own risk.
