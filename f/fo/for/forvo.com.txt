Your personal data will be used for the generic purpose of the management and administration of the website, and specifically:
To communicate with users in response to requests, comments and questions that they might make through the contact forms on our website (including emails, phone calls, etc.)
For Newsletters : We can use your data to send our newsletter with news and our services or products, as well as third-party news where appropriate. This newsletter will be, in any case, expressly authorized by the user who can revoke at any time their consent to receive these notifications using the mechanism implemented to that end, or by sending a letter with the subject "Usubscribe" to info@forvo.com.
We will not process your personal data for any other purpose beyond those described above, unless it is imposed by law or there is a judicial requirement.
DURATION OF DATA PROCESSING
Forvo will keep and process personal data from the moment the user gives their consent until they request, cancel or withdraw their consent for data processing.
If the subscription is cancelled, the pronunciations will be kept in accordance with the license of intellectual property of the website, although they are pseudo-anonymous, without including any personal data that could identify the author of the pronunciation.
Possibility to withdraw the consent : The user has the right to withdraw the consent at any time, without affecting the legality of the treatment based on the consent prior to its withdrawal. Likewise, the user may object at any time to the reception of any electronic communication from Forvo.
LEGITIMATION OF DATA PROCESSING
The legal basis for data processing is the legitimation based on the consent of the interested party for the purposes described above, which will be requested at the time of:
proceeding to treat your data
the inclusion of your data in our forms
signing up for our newsletter
The registration on the website and the requests for information that you send us require that the interested party voluntarily provide us with the necessary information to be able to assist them or provide them with the Services. The obligation or necessity of providing us with these data will be marked with an asterisk (*) in the forms or sections corresponding to each service.
However, the interested party can freely refuse to provide us with these data or, later, revoke the consent previously granted to process their data, although that refusal will imply our impossibility of being able to attend to their request or continue with the registration in our platform.
Likewise, we will be able to process your data based on the legitimate interest of Forvo to maintain and retain its users and better meet their previously expressed expectations or interests, e.g. improvement of services and products, management of requests, queries or claims, offer of products and similar services, information about promotions etc., without the prejudice to Forvo's compliance with the rest of the obligations related to sending commercial communications electronically.
Forvo understands that, by providing us with these data, the interested party guarantees and is responsible for the veracity, certainty and accuracy thereof and that they accept and consent expressly the processing of their data for the purposes described above.
RECIPIENTS OF ASSIGNMENTS OR TRANSFERS
With general character, Forvo will not transfer your personal data to third parties, unless we are legally bound to do so or you have expressly authorised us when using our services.
SOCIAL NETWORKS
Forvo has different social networks (Facebook, Twitter, etc.) to disseminate contents related to Forvo as well as to provide users with a way of contact. Forvo is responsible for the treatment of the data of its followers and contacts in social networks. Nevertheless, since the processing of personal data takes place within the framework of social networks whose suppliers impose operating rules, Forvo's obligations will be limited to those aspects in which the company is free to act. Under no circumstances will Forvo extract data from social networks, make profiles of its users or collect additional personal data related to tastes, hobbies or mode of use of social networks, without the express consent of those affected.
