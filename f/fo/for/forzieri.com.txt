Information We Collect and How It's Used
We collect and process only the data that is required to allow us to provide our services to you.
We do not provide products or services that are designed for use by children under the age of 16, or knowingly collect personal information from or about children under age 16.
We collect the following data when you browse or shop at Forzieri.com:
Information You Explicitly Provide
via Order Form:
We collect the personal data required to allow us to fulfil our contract with you including taking payment and any related anti-fraud checks if you choose to pay by credit/debit card. This data may include your name, billing address, shipping address, payment details, phone number and email address. We collect your email address in order to send you confirmation of your order; we collect your phone number so that we can contact you if there are any issues with the order.
If you provide us with someone else's data - for example, if you purchase a product to be delivered to a friend or as a gift - we will collect and process the personal data required to complete the transaction such as the name, delivery address and other contact details for your friend. If you are receiving an item as a gift, we will process your data only to fulfil the gift request and our contractual obligations.
We process your orders ourselves, in house, and thus we rarely need to share this information with any third parties. However, when we have to share this information, it will only be that information which is absolutely necessary, and only with those third parties that may be involved in the processing of your order in the future. For example, the financial institution that issued your credit card and the shipping carrier that delivers your order.
When making a payment via the Paypal option be aware that you will be entering your personal and financial information on the Paypal website even though the FORZIERI logo frames the top of the page. This for ease of navigation back to the FORZIERI site. For information provided on the Paypal website please refer to Paypal's Privacy Policy. None of the information provided by the user to Paypal is shared back to the FORZIERI site as all necessary information to process the order are already provided by the user to FORZIERI before the payment. Paypal simply communicates to FORZIERI the approval or not to accept the purchase.
via our Account Registration Form
If you register for a FORZIERI account, we collect your name, email address, password, and country.
via our Customer Care team
When you contact our Customer Care team through one of our email addresses, via the "Contact Us Form" or by telephone we collect your name, email address, phone number and country and we will only use that information to send you a prompt reply. We may collect additional data to help us resolve any queries relating to your order, delivery, payments, marketing, the website or any other queries.
via Forzieri Privileges Club
We collect your email address when you sign up to become a member of our Forzieri Privileges Club. We will send an email newsletter with our announcements and special offers from time to time until you decide to unsubscribe. Subscription to our newsletter is optional and requires your explicit consent via our Forzieri Privileges Club Page or by visiting our store in person and signing up. If you wish to stop receiving our newsletter, please click on the link marked "unsubscribe" which can be found at the bottom of every email or contact our Customer Care team.
via Wish List Creation
By creating a Wishlist on the FORZIERI Site you are required to provide your name and email address. We use this information solely to make the wish list accessible to your person. Optionally, in case you wish to make your Wish List searchable by others, you can choose to provide some unique facts about your person, date of birth (please note that only month and day are asked for, not year of birth) and gift giving event type to make it easier for your friends to recognize your list in our public list database. Also, optionally, you can provide your shipping address so that friends can buy from your Wish List and have items shipped direct to you. To protect your privacy, when you choose to make your list searchable, FORZIERI does not display your full shipping address (only City and State) or email address. We will not use Wish List data for additional mailings or marketing purposes.
via Live Chat
If you have questions about the FORZIERI products, you have the option to use our "live chat" support service. This service asks you for a user name (you can use your real name or you can use an alias). The chat transcript is saved in a secure location along with your IP address. This not only protects our customer care representatives against inappropriate chat content on the part of unscrupulous users, but it also allows us to pull up your previous chat session if you come back later and chat again. This feature makes use of cookies on our website to facilitate one on one dialogue and to provide us insight into how our users navigate our website. However, we have no access to or control over these cookies, once we have given permission for them to set cookies.
