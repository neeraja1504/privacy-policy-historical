Your California Privacy Rights. Residents of the State of California, please also read statement below titled Your California Privacy Rights to understand additional rights you may have pursuant to California Civil Code Section 1798.83.
B. INFORMATION WE COLLECT THROUGH OUR SERVICES
We collect two types of information from you and other visitors to our services: (1) "personally identifiable information" (as described below) and (2) non-personally identifiable information (as described below).
"Personally identifiable information" is information that identifies you personally, such as your name, address, telephone number, email address, or company name. Here are some examples of the ways in which we may collect and store your personally identifiable information through our services:
we may collect your email address, first and last name, and zip code, if you sign up for an online newsletter;
we may collect your email address if you contact us with a question;
we may collect your first and last name, date of birth, and email address if you choose to participate in a contest or sweepstakes; and
we may collect your first and last name, your address, and your credit card and billing information to enable you to make a purchase.
"Non-personally identifiable information" can be technical information or it can be demographic information, such as your age, gender, or interests. Non-personally identifiable information does not identify you personally. If you do provide us with non-personally identifiable information, we may use it for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy or where it is collected, or any other legal purpose.
Here are some examples of the ways in which we may collect and store your non-personally identifiable information through our services, and how we use such information:
Internet Protocol (IP) address. Your "IP address" is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send you data, such as the screens and pages of our services that you view. We use this information to deliver our screens and pages to you upon request, to tailor our services to the interests of you and our other visitors, and to measure traffic to and within our services.
Cookie. A "cookie" is a small text file that may be used to collect information about your activity on our services. For example, when you visit a screen or page on our services, a cookie is placed on your machine (if you or your browser accept the cookie). This cookie may then be read by screen or pages on our services. You may configure your browser to notify you or to reject and block cookies, but if you do, you may not have access to some areas of our services, or to the personalized features of our services.
Web Beacon. A "web beacon", "clear gif", "web bug", or "pixel tag" is a tiny graphic file with a unique identifier, that is similar in function to a cookie, but allows us to count the number of users that have visited certain pages or screens of our services, and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns. When used in HTML-formatted email messages, web beacons can tell the sender whether and when the email has been opened. In contrast to cookies, which may be stored on your computer's hard drive, web beacons are typically embedded invisibly on pages or screens.
Demographic Information. "Demographic information" may be your gender, age, zip code, and interests. We may collect such information about your through our services and use it to provide you with personalized services and to analyze trends to ensure that our services and the information on them is targeted to meet your needs. Please note that we also consider aggregated information, which is not personally identifiable, to be non-personally identifiable information.
If you encounter a screen or page that requests information you do not want to share with us, do not enter the information and do not proceed with that screen or page.
C. USE OF INFORMATION COLLECTED THROUGH OUR SERVICES
Personally identifiable information. If you do provide us with personally identifiable information, we will only use it for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy or where it is collected. Primarily, we use it on our services to:

We may use non-personally identifiable information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy or where it is collected, or any other legal purpose, including, when and where applicable, combining non-personally identifiable information with personally identifiable information.
D. SHARING AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION COLLECTED THROUGH OUR SERVICES

CALIFORNIA USA RESIDENTS - YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS
(As provided by California Civil Code Section 1798.83)
A California USA resident who has provided personal information to a business with whom he/she has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes ("California customer") is entitled to request information about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. In general, if the business has made such a disclosure of personal information, upon receipt of a request by a California customer, the business is required to provide a list of all third parties to whom personal information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of personal information that were disclosed.
However, under the law, a business is not required to provide the above-described lists if the business adopts and discloses to the public (in its privacy policy ) a policy of not disclosing customer's personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, as long as the business maintains and discloses this policy. Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of personal information and providing a cost free means to exercise that right.
As stated in our Privacy Policy, we do not share information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure -- typically by opting-in to receive information from a third party. To prevent disclosure of your personal information for use in direct marketing by a third party, do not opt-in to such use when you provide personal information on our service. Please note that whenever you opt-in to receive future communications from a third party, your information will be subject to the third-party's privacy policies and practices. If you later decide that you do not want that third party to use your information, you will need to contact the third party directly, as we have no control over how third parties use information. You should always review the privacy policies and practices of any party that collects your information to determine how that entity will handle your information.
California customers may request further information about our compliance with this law by e-mailing privacy@forbestravelguide.com Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through this e-mail address.
CALIFORNIA DO NOT TRACK NOTICE:
Some browsers have a "Do Not Track" feature that lets you tell websites and online services that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. Such browser features and industry standards are not uniform, so our websites and online services do not respond to those signals.
