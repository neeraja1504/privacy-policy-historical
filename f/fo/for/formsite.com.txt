Information we collect
Formsite customers
When you sign up for a Formsite account, you give us some personal information like your email address. If you choose to pay for a service upgrade using a credit card, we collect your name, billing address, and credit card information. If you email us, your email address and any personal information is contained and archived.
We use commonly-used internet technologies like cookies and Google Analytics to track and analyze site visitors and customer interactions.
Your Formsite account activities and IP address are logged when you are logged-in to your account, as are many of your actions related to form building, results processing, and other services provided inside your account.
Form visitors
Formsite form visitors who complete forms made by our customers and may, depending entirely on the customers' forms, divulge personal information and/or manually uploaded files, are collected and stored within our secure database and file storage areas.
Form visitor logs are kept to track site usage, statistical information on technical capabilities and version numbers, and behavioral tracking.
