When does Fort Wayne Newspapers collect my personally identifiable information?
We will ask you for personally identifying information when you register on one of Fort Wayne Newspapers' sites, or prior to use of certain features or services on any of our sites.

If you are making a purchase or enrolling in a premium service for which there is a fee, we or a third party working in partnership with us will collect your credit card, billing address and other verifying information. In addition, we may collect personally identifiable information from you when you provide content for us to display or use on one or more of the Fort Wayne Newspapers sites, including but not limited to, when you participate in user surveys, post messages to bulletin boards or chat areas, submit personals or other classified listings, submit photos, report a problem with one of our sites or services, or submit a letter to the editor.

Cookies
Like many other commercial sites, our sites may utilize a standard technology called a "cookie" to collect information about how our site is used. Cookies were designed to help a Web site recognize a user's browser as a previous visitor and thus remember any preferences that may have been set while the user was browsing the site. A cookie cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive, pass on a computer virus or capture your e-mail address. You can set your browser preferences to reject all cookies, but then you will not be able to participate in most customized services, and you may be required to repeatedly log in to participate in various services, promotions or product offerings.
Our Web sites use cookies to enhance your visit. Cookies can securely store a user's password, personalize home pages, identify which parts of a site have been visited or keep track of selections, such as those selected in a "shopping cart." Our cookies may collect your domain name and track your selections through our Web pages. However, we only use cookies to gather the information indicated in this policy and do not use cookies to gather personally identifying information about you without your consent.
We also use cookies that contain no personal information at all. These cookies help us estimate our audience size, determine which areas of Fort Wayne Newspapers' sites are the most popular, and serve targeted advertising. Third-party advertisers and our ad server may set and access their cookies on your computer in accordance with their own privacy policies. If you would like more information about the use of cookies by our third-party ad server, please click here: http://www.247realmedia.com/EN-US/privacy-policy.html.
Most browsers can be configured to reject cookies or alert you when cookies are being sent. Keep in mind, however, that if you refuse cookies, it is possible that some portions of Fort Wayne Newspapers' sites may not function exactly as intended.
IP Address
Fort Wayne Newspapers may also collect IP addresses for the purpose of systems administration or to report information in aggregate form to our advertisers (e.g. how many visitors logged in to a Fort Wayne Newspapers site). An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer automatically when you use the Internet. When you visit a particular Fort Wayne Newspapers Web page, our servers log your IP address. Your IP address is not linked to personally identifiable information.
How is my personally identifiable information used?
Our main goal is to provide you with a customized and more relevant experience on Fort Wayne Newspapers' sites. We review our users' preferences, demographics, traffic patterns and other information in aggregate so that we can better understand who our audience is and what it is you want. Tracking user preferences also helps us serve you more relevant advertising. Please note that we do not share your personally identifying information with the advertiser.
We use a third party to serve ads when you visit our site. This third party ad server may use certain information about your visit to our site in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you, but they are not allowed to collect or use personally identifiable information about you for their own purposes.
All credit card information is transmitted in an encrypted form, using SSL (secure socket layer) encryption, the industry standard. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. Fort Wayne Newspapers assumes no liability for disclosure of data due to errors in transmission or unauthorized third parties. If you have any questions about security on our Web sites, you can contact us at: contact@fortwayne.com.

If you opt into a third-party offer on this site, your relationship with the third party will be governed by their respective privacy policies. If you no longer wish to receive communication from the third party, you will need to contact them directly to opt out. When you sign up for some third-party services on this site, such as free coupons or Yellow Pages, you will be taken to a co-branded site that may appear to be FortWayne.com. However, if the third party is collecting information from you, the use of this information is governed by the co-branded partner's privacy policy.
Who does Fort Wayne Newspapers share information with?

If you do not accept any of the offers, your information will not be retained by our registration offers partner.
To the extent you are notified of uses of your personal information that are different from those described in this Privacy Policy during your enrollment in any particular service, sweepstakes, contest or promotion, the uses of which you are specifically notified will govern that service, sweepstakes, contest or promotion. We may co-sponsor some contests on our site with other companies. If you enter one of these contests, our co-sponsor may receive the information collected. In such cases, we will tell you who the co-sponsor is and notify you if the use of this information is governed by the co-sponsor's privacy policy.
We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or legal process served on our Web site.
