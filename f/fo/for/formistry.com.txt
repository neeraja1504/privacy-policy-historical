If you have forgotten your password, please click the "Forgot Password?" link to have password reset instructions emailed to you.
Where Formistry is deployed on behalf of Clients, Universities, Colleges or Institutions, GreenClouds has no direct relationship with the individuals/ applicants/ candidates whose personal data is processed on Formistry. An individual/ applicant/ candidate who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct her/his query to the Client, Universities, Colleges or Institutions (the data controller).

We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. Also remember to sign out of your Formistry registration account and close your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer or other electronic device with someone else or are using a computer or other electronic device in a public place like a library or Internet "cafe." Also, to help ensure the security of your application, do not copy and paste links from within the online application into an email or share with others on a public forum. If you do not log out of the online system, users with technical knowledge may use these links to access your online application.
When you make submissions through Formistry, supplements or other applicant forms directly on the website or through Client, Colleges, Universities or Institutions or when you access your user registered account information from our Website, or our mobile app, or when you give us your permission to share certain of your personal information with Test Pre and Other organisations for the purpose of participating in tests/programs/ assessments, we offer the use of a secure server. The secure server software encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. We also restrict access to the secure server through the use of firewalls.
When you provide your personal information on Formistry’s online application, this information is accessed by the Client, Colleges, Universities or Institutions that have deployed the Formistry application. Consequently, your personal information can then be viewed, printed and/or exported electronically to the Client, Colleges, Universities or Institutions which are located outside and separate from the Formistry web site and outside of the jurisdiction and perhaps country where you originally entered the information.
Payments
Formistry is integrated with authorized bank or payment gateway providers to enable applicants/ candidates to pay application and other fees online. We DO NOT store credit card and other credit card related particulars of candidates/ applicants. The integration that is College/ Client/ University/ Institution specific is designed such that once the candidates/ applicant completes the form and clicks “Submit" he/she is directed to the payment gateway where payment is made. Sometimes if you click " Payment" link more than once, it is possible your account will have a duplicate charge. Our Client Colleges and/or Universities will reverse charges for any duplicate transaction. However, neither greenclouds, its client colleges or universities, nor third party independent contractors will be responsible for refunding any processing fees incurred by the incorrect use of this feature. Accordingly, to avoid duplicate charges, please do not click the payment SUBMIT button more than once.
Data Retention
Your personal information obtained through Formistry is retained for a maximum of five consecutive application admissions cycles, depending on Client requirement. Your personal information is removed or "archived," after two consecutive application admissions cycles have lapsed, off the "live" servers and "backed-up" to a separate secured remote server for storage (at least until overwritten when space is needed to back-up more recent data) where no one can access it except on a very limited basis by us or our trustworthy independent web service provider responsible for storage of your personal information. Unless under court order, your application once archived remains irretrievable. Therefore, you are strongly advised to print for your own records a hard copy of all Formistry forms that you may have completed. We will retain personal data we process on behalf of our Clients for as long as needed to provide services to our Client. GreenClouds will retain this personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, GREEN CLOUDS EDUCATION SOLUTIONS PVT.LTD www.greenclouds.in  and enforce our agreements.
Note that the reasons for granting us continued limited access to your personal information from the remote server may include, but are not necessarily limited to, allowing us, our trustworthy independent web service providers or other partners, or authorized Clients Colleges/Universities to compile aggregate or historical information about applications submitted in previous years. For statistical purposes, your personal information will be used only in the aggregate meaning that personal identifying information such as your name and aadhar/ passport number shall not be used. For some historical purposes, however, we and our trustworthy independent web service providers or other partners, including Client, Colleges, Universities and authorized Institutions will have continued access to your archived personal identifying information as we and/or our trustworthy independent web service providers or other partners deem necessary.
Security
The security of your personal information and our clients’ information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information such as login credentials or payment details we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us online, including any information that you send or receive as an email or text message that is sent or received over your own email domain account, cell phone app or cell phone service, and you do so at your own risk.
Also, Formistry is not responsible and does not assume any liability for any texts, emails or other communications that you receive from or send to any of our clients, and we cannot accept liability for disclosure of any of your personal information due to errors in transmission or unauthorized or illegal acts of third parties.
Greenclouds Identity Theft Policy
While rare, the risk of identity theft to on-line users of the Internet is on the rise and GreenClouds recognizes the importance of taking steps to help its student applicants, users, customers and members identify and detect patterns, practices or activities that may indicate the existence of identity theft involving Formistry including implementing the appropriate actions or responses to help safeguard against and/or mitigate the risk of future or continued theft. Please read carefully the identity theft portions of this Privacy Policy before using Formistry.
The identity theft portions of this Privacy Policy are to help all Formistry users identify identity theft and to provide them with information about what steps GreenClouds takes to detect identity theft, safeguard against, respond to and/or mitigate continued or future GREEN CLOUDS EDUCATION SOLUTIONS PVT.LTD www.greenclouds.in identity theft involving Formistry website, application and services
Please also note that the identity theft portions of this Policy also only address Formistry identity theft policy concerning activities involving its own web site, service and our mobile app and it does not apply to activities or identity theft policies of others or other web sites or apps independent from, referenced or linked to the Formistry Application or website e, such as web sites, apps or IT systems of Client Colleges or Universities or Institutions or other third parties or any individuals or officials that may be associated with these other institutions or third parties.
Patterns, Practices or Activities that May Indicate the Existence of Identity Theft
In order to be on-guard for possible identity theft, all candidates, applicants, users, customers and members should be aware of the potential indicators of identity theft. These may include but are not necessarily limited to the following:
Receiving an alert, notification or warning from a consumer reporting agency
Receiving notification of a address discrepancy
Receiving notification of an account being involuntarily closed
Receiving or becoming aware of suspicious documents, information or photos provided for identification that appear to have been altered or forged or are inconsistent with other authenticated and accessible personal identifying information

Any unusual use of or suspicious activity involving or relating to any account that is held with Formistry
Steps Formistry Takes to Detect Identity Theft
Formistry is used for students to apply for admissions/ opportunities with the Client organisation that deploys Formistry or can be used directly by candidates to explore possible Education and Employment opportunities. While Formistry through its trustworthy web service providers deploys several security measures to protect the personal identifying information of its users, such security measures may not always prevent the crime of identity theft due to the specific nature of this crime. Accordingly, GreenClouds must also rely upon the credible reporting of suspicious patterns, practices or activities of identity theft from its trustworthy student applicants, users, customers, members or school officials.
In this connection, any student applicant, user, school official or member that becomes aware of any suspicious pattern, practice or activity suggestive of an identity theft that also involves or relates to Formistry is urged to notify the GreenClouds via email at GREEN CLOUDS EDUCATION SOLUTIONS PVT.LTD www.greenclouds.in  privacyquestions@formistry.com. Please be sure to disclose your name, all relevant information about the suspected identity theft including information about how you may be contacted.

Upon receiving credible information about a possible identity theft or other possible related wrongdoing involving or relating to the Formistry service, the Formistry website or mobile app from a trustworthy student applicant, user, customer, school official or other trustworthy third party, GreenClouds will do what it reasonably can to investigate the merits of the claim by gathering up any other information within its reasonable control in order to evaluate whether there has been a possible attempt to commit identity theft or other possible related wrongdoing. If Formistry believes there are grounds for believing in good faith that an attempt at wrongdoing was made, we reserve the right to cancel or close an offending or possible tainted transaction or account, monitor a particular account or line of communication, change applicable security codes, notify law enforcement officials, notify the victim of the alleged attempted fraud or other wrongdoing, provide to the victim certain information (including the personal identifying information of another user) if reasonably requested or justified and/or do such other acts reasonable and/or necessary to protect Formistry and/or victim of the alleged theft or other possible wrongdoing and otherwise comply with any data breach notification or identity theft law that is applicable to the particular circumstance. Formistry also reserves the right not to take any action if no such action is warranted. Formistry reserves the right to rely upon its trustworthy independent web service providers to help implement, safeguard against and/or mitigate continued or future identity theft or other possible wrongdoing involving any student applicant, user, customer, member or school official when the alleged theft or other possible wrongdoing involves or is related to the Formistry service.
