providers. We will notify you when we receive information about you from these providers
and the purposes for which we intend to use that information.
Cookies
Cookies are small pieces of data sent from a website and stored on the user’s computer by
the user's web browser while the user is browsing to remember information (such as items
added in the shopping cart in an online store) or to record the user's browsing activity.
The “Help” feature on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from
accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie,
or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used
by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the
website of its manufacturer.
Because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of FLP’s essential features, we
recommend that you leave them turned on.
Disclosure of Your Information
Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the
business of selling it to others. We share customer information only as described below and
with subsidiaries. You agree that we have the right to disclose your personal information as
needed to conduct our business activities according to the following, and in the following,
circumstances:
•   Internal Disclosure: We necessarily require storage and disclosure of your information
within our various business units on an as-needed basis in order to effectively conduct
our legitimate business activities.
•   Third-Party Service Providers: We employ other companies and individuals to
perform functions on our behalf. Examples may include sending postal mail and e-mail,
removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing
marketing assistance, providing search results and links, processing credit card
payments, and providing customer service. These providers have access to personal
information needed to perform their functions in accordance with contractual
obligations but may not use it for other purposes.
•   Promotional Offers: FLP never sells, trades, or leases your personal information to an
unrelated third party without your express consent. From time to time, FLP may send
offers and promotional material to you to (1) provide you with information about other
goods and services that FLP offers that are similar to those that you have purchased and
inquired about, or (2) to notify you about changes to our goods and services. Individuals
are free to opt-out of these promotional offers at any time on the website, e-mail
transmittal, or by contacting our Home Office by telephone at 1-888-440-ALOE (2563).
•   Business Transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy
properties, subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, customer information

generally is one of the transferred and/or shared business assets but remains subject to
the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer
consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that FLP assets are acquired, customer
information may be one of the transferred assets.
•   Protection of FLP and Others: We release account and other personal information
when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply
our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of
FLP, our customers, or others. This may include exchanging information with other
companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously,
however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing
personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in
violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Notice.
•   With Your Consent: Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when
information about you might be sent to other third parties, and you will have an
opportunity to choose not to share the information.
Where We Store Your Personal Information
The information that we collect from you will be transferred to, and stored at, a destination
in the United States, outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). It will also be processed
by staff operating outside the EEA who are employed by one or more of our FLP entities. This
includes staff engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your orders, the processing
of your payment details, and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal
information, you agree to its transfer, storing, or processing. We will take all steps reasonably
necessary to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with this
Privacy Notice.
All information you provide to us is stored on secure servers. We maintain a wide variety of
programs and security and controls to protect your information. Any payment transactions
will be encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. We follow the Payment Card
Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) when handling credit card data. Where we have
given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts
of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to
share a password with anyone. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure.
Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the
security of your information transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk.
Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features
to try to prevent unauthorized access.

•   The right to know the consequences of your failure to provide necessary information.
•   The right to not be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing.
If you make a request to delete your personal information and that information is necessary
for the products or services you have purchased, the request will be honored only to the
extent it is no longer necessary for any services purchased or required for our legitimate
business purposes or legal or contractual record keeping requirements.
