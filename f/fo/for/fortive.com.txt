How long we keep your information will depend on the purpose for which we use it.
We only keep your information for as long as is reasonably necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy
Notice or, if longer, as required by applicable law or regulation. We have internal rules that set out how long

legal obligations, for example in relation to tax, health and safety, and potential or actual disputes or
investigations.
Who do we share your personal data with?
From time to time your personal data may be shared with third parties such our professional advisers,
service providers, group companies, and corporate transactional (mergers and acquisitions) partners and
advisors for the following purposes.
•    Professional advisers: including accountancy and legal firms where they require that information in
order to provide Fortive with advice;
•    Service providers: including those organisations who provide and support our data management and
storage systems;
•    Group companies: Fortive is a member of a global organisation, and data may be shared internally
within the group, primarily for business and operational purposes.
•    Merger partners: it may be that Fortive or any of its affiliates merges or is acquired by a separate
organisation, in which case it will become necessary to share personal data with them.
All of these third parties are bound to comply with similar and equally stringent undertakings of privacy and
confidentiality.
Where required we share your personal information with third parties to comply with a legal obligation;
when we believe in good faith that an applicable law requires it; at the request of governmental authorities
conducting an investigation; to detect and protect against fraud, or any technical or security vulnerabilities;
to respond to an emergency; or otherwise to protect the rights, property, safety, or security of third parties,
visitors to our websites, our businesses, or the public.
No other third parties have access to your information unless we specifically say so in this Privacy Notice, or
the law requires this.
What legal basis do we have for using your personal data?
We process your information:
•    to be able to provide you with products and services in line with our Terms & Conditions and the other
information provided via Fortive websites.
•    as this is necessary for the performance of the contract with you or to take steps at your request prior
to entering into this contract.
•    to comply with our legal obligations.
•    to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of others.
•    as this is necessary in pursuit of our legitimate interests in operating a global business, and this includes
profiling related to your personal data. While there are some risks inherent in any processing of
personal data, we have considered the risk to your data protection rights and on balance determined it
is outweighed by the significant benefits in providing Fortive’s goods and services to a relevant and
interested marketplace. We’ve also implemented processes and controls to protect your rights. You
have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time to processing of

personal data concerning you which is based on legitimate interests. More information on this right and
on how to exercise it is set out below.
•   for health or disability requirements that you or others provide about you. In such cases we always ask
for your consent before undertaking such processing and you have the right to withdraw your consent
at any time. More information on this right and how to exercise it is set out below.
•   On the basis of your consent for us to process your personal data for a particular purpose.
What happens if you do not provide us with the information we request or ask that we stop processing your
information?
We sometimes have statutory and contractual obligations that require us to process your information. If you
don’t provide the information requested, we may not be able to fulfil our contract with you or perform our
obligations to you or related others.
Do we make solely automated decisions concerning you?
No, we do not carry out solely automated decision making or automated profiling.
Do we use Cookies to collect personal data on you?
To provide better service to you on our websites, we and our service providers use cookies to collect your

Where do we store your personal data? Do we transfer your personal data outside the EEA?
We store your personal data safely at our premises, in contracted storage facilities, with our service
providers, or on our servers within the country where we are based and otherwise within the European
Economic Area (EEA).
We strive to process your information within the country where we collected it or within the EEA. If we or
our service providers transfer personal data, where relevant, outside of the EEA, we will always require that
appropriate safeguards are in place to protect the information that is transferred. For example, a portion of
Page 4
[GDPR Programme]

PRIVACY NOTICE
our centralised Compliance, Marketing, and Finance functions are performed outside of the EEA, in the USA,
so we have put in place safeguards to protect personal data exported from the EEA that is processed in or
accessed from the USA. You can obtain a copy of the safeguards in place for such transfers by contacting us
using the details at the end of this Privacy Notice.
How do we keep your personal data secure?
We ensure the security of your personal data by implementing a specific set of technical and organisational
security measures that are based on controls published by the Center for Internet Security. These controls
call for the use of encryption, firewalls, and other measures that ensure we provide a level of security
appropriate to the risk presented by a particular situation.
What rights do you have in relation to the personal data we hold on you?
By law, you have a number of rights when it comes to your personal data. We describe them below.
Further information and advice about your rights can be obtained from the data protection regulator in
your country.
Rights                                         What does this mean?
1. The right to be informed                  You have the right to be provided with clear, transparent and
easily understandable information about how we use your
information and your rights. This is why we’re providing you with
the information in this Privacy Notice.
2. The right of access                       You have the right to obtain access to your information (if we’re
processing it), and certain other information (similar to that
provided in this Privacy Notice).
This is so you’re aware and can check that we’re using your
information in accordance with data protection law.
3. The right to rectification                You are entitled to have your information corrected if it’s
inaccurate or incomplete.
4. The right to erasure                      This is also known as ‘the right to be forgotten’ and, in simple
terms, enables you to request the deletion or removal of your
information where there’s no compelling reason for us to keep
using it. This is not a general right to erasure; there are
exceptions.
5. The right to restrict processing          You have rights to ‘block’ or suppress further use of your
information. When processing is restricted, we can still store
your information, but may not use it further. We keep lists of
people who have asked for further use of their information to be
‘blocked’ to make sure the restriction is respected in future.

Rights                                       What does this mean?
6. The right to data portability           You have rights to obtain and reuse your personal data for your
own purposes across different services. For example, if you
decide to switch to a new provider, this enables you to move,
copy or transfer your information easily between our IT systems
and theirs safely and securely, without affecting its usability.
7. The right to object to processing       You have the right to object to certain types of processing,
including processing based on our legitimate interests and
processing for direct marketing (i.e. if you no longer want to be
contacted with potential opportunities).
8. The right to lodge a complaint          You have the right to lodge a complaint about the way we handle
or process your personal data with your national data protection
regulator.
9. The right to withdraw consent           If you have given your consent to anything we do with your
personal data, you have the right to withdraw your consent at
any time (although if you do so, it does not mean that anything
we have done with your personal data with your consent up to
that point is unlawful). This includes your right to withdraw
consent to us using your personal data for marketing purposes.
How can you make a request to exercise your rights?
To exercise any of the rights above, or to ask a question, contact us using the details set out at the end of
this Privacy Notice.
How will we handle a request to exercise your rights?
We’ll respond as soon as we can, generally within one month from when we receive your request. If we
expect your request is going to take us longer to fulfil, we’ll come back to you within that first month and let
you know.
We usually act on requests and provide information free of charge, but we may charge a reasonable fee to
cover our administrative costs of providing the information for baseless or excessive/repeated requests and
requests for further copies of the same information. Alternatively, the law may allow us to refuse to act on
such requests.
How can you contact us?
If you have questions on the processing of your personal data, would like to exercise any of your rights, or
are unhappy with how we’ve handled your information, please contact us here: Investor Relations, 6920
