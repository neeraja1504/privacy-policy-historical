Visitor Tracking
We sometimes collect anonymous information through the use of various technologies, possibly including one called "cookies," to help us provide better customer service. For example, we keep track of the domains from which people visit and we also measure visitor activity on FontRiver.com, but we do so in ways that keep the information anonymous. This anonymous information is sometimes referred to as "clickstream data." FontRiver.com or its analytic vendors may use this data to analyze trends and statistics and to help us provide better customer service.
Also, when we collect personal data, we may extract some information and combine it with other information, such as clickstream data. This information is used and analyzed only at an aggregate level to help us understand trends and patterns. None of this information is reviewed at an individual level. If you do not want your personal information used in this manner, you can opt-out by clicking on the link to our "Contact Us" page.
