Collection of personal information
When you engage in certain activities on this site, such as viewing prices, ordering or selecting products, downloading software, or entering contests, FontShop International may ask you to provide certain information about yourself by filling out and submitting an online form. It is completely optional for you to engage in these activities. If you elect to engage in these activities, however, FontShop International may ask that you provide us personal information, such as: your name, address, phone number, e-mail address and if you download products we will require your credit card details.
How your personal information is used
FontShop International collects your information in order to record and support your participation in the activities you select. If you order a product that is to be electronically downloaded, for example, the information is used to verify credit cards, issue multi-user license documents, re-deliver orders in the case of transmission failure and to maintain your customer history.
Protection of your personal information
The personal information that you provide is protected in several ways. Access by you to your personal information is available through a password and unique customer ID selected by you. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. In addition, your personal information resides on a secure server that only selected FontShop International personnel may access via password. FontShop International protects your credit card transaction using SSL encryption and thereby prevents unauthorized parties from viewing such information when it is being transmitted to FontShop International. We do not sell or divulge your personal information to third parties.
