Those safeguards will include measures for preventing unauthorized access, use, modification, deletion and disclosure of information by our personnel or third parties.

What We do Collect and When
We collect different information about You when You use the App and Website. For convenience, we have divided it into two small groups: automatic collection and vulnerable. Automatic collection: whenever You access or use the Services, we may use technologies that automatically or passively collect information about how the Services are accessed and used. Vulnerable collection: includes the information, You provide us upon Your own will to do so. Herewith You can see what we do collect when You use:
1. The app
(a) Automatic Collection. (“Other Data”)
We automatically collect Your IP address , Your computer’s unique ID , operating system , the version of application , downloaded on Your computer; time when You open and close the App; the errors , which may occur during Your use of the App and the fonts downloaded to the App. We may use this information to, among other things, help diagnose problems with our servers, analyze trends, resolve bugs and gather information for aggregate use. We do collect it every time, when You use the Services. We see how much time You spend using Services and when just to adjust our App and make it as user friendly as possible.
As with most websites and technology services delivered over the Internet, our servers automatically collect information when You access or use the App and record it in log files on Your computer. This log data include App version, when the App was launched, when was closed, Your actions in the App, crash reports and operation system, technical messages. This is needed to support the normal functioning of the App on Your computer with minimum service errors.
(b) Vulnerable Collection (“Personal Data”)
FontBase does not ask You to provide us with any information before You become Awesome. We simply do not need it and You are not bothered filling the forms. When this moment occurs and You are purchasing Awesome, we need the information about You for billing purposes. That is the moment when we are collecting the information about You. Our form contains the minimum information required for successful processing of a credit card transaction and register the user to receive technical support: Billing address , Full Name , Country , Email , Credit Card details. Nothing more than this. All information including credit card numbers are always collected via a secure server to prevent unauthorized access during transmission of the data. Do not buy from the other resources, our official Website is only this one: https://fontba.se.
2. The website
(a) Automatic Collection. (“Other Data”)
We personally do not collect the information, when You simply searching through our Website.
