Monotype’s Commitment to Personal Information Protection
At Monotype, we respect your right to privacy. Protecting the security and privacy of your personal information is important to us. We understand that as a visitor to our Site, you prefer to control your own personal information preferences and we give you the option to do so. We hope the policy outlined below will help you understand what personal information we may collect, how we use and safeguard that personal information and with whom we may share it.
Voluntary Personal Information We May Collect
We may ask you to register or provide personal information and preferences when you visit certain areas of our Site, request information, purchase products or subscribe to company newsletters. When you provide Monotype with your name, email address, mailing address, or telephone number, and you don’t “opt-out”, we may use this information to alert you to company news, new services and other company and product information. If you don’t want Monotype or Monotype representatives to contact you, you may “opt-out” of this preference at any time, whether you’re online or contacting Monotype directly. You’ll always have the flexibility to “opt-in” at any time based on previous information or newly updated information.
Non-Voluntary Personal Information We May Collect
When you browse our Site, you can generally do so anonymously as we don’t collect personal information when you browse; however, your browser automatically tells us the type of computer and operating system you’re using. Like most standard Web site servers, our Site uses log files (cookies).

Purpose of Collecting Personal Information
When you do provide us with personal data, we usually use it to respond to your inquiry, process your order or provide you access to specific information or offers. Also, to support our customer relationship with you, we may store and process voluntary and non-voluntary personal data and share it with our worldwide affiliates to better understand your business needs and how we can improve our products and services. If you choose not to have your personal data used to support our customer relationship (especially direct marketing or market research), we will respect your choice. We do not sell or otherwise market your personal data to third parties.
Limitation on the Purpose
We collect, use or disclose personal information supplied by you only for the purpose(s) initially identified by you, however, in some cases we may use the personal information supplied by you: (i) for any additional purpose that is directly related to the original purpose for which the personal information was collected, including sharing such personal information with a third party vendor if you purchased a product supplied by that third party vendor from one of our Sites, (ii) when it is necessary to prepare, negotiate and perform a contract with you, (iii) when it is required by law or the competent governmental or judicial authorities, (iv) when it is necessary to establish or preserve a legal claim or defense, or (v) when it is necessary to prevent fraud or other illegal activities.
How We Protect Your Personal Information
Monotype uses its best efforts to try to protect the personal information that you share with us. Monotype stores information in a controlled, secure environment. We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, however we only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.
How to Update Your Personal Information or “Opt-out”
You can help Monotype maintain the accuracy of your personal information by notifying us when you change your name, address, title, phone number, e-mail address or your content preferences.
