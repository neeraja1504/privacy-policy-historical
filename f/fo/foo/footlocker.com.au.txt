With this in mind, we have adopted this Privacy Policy, which describes the information we may collect when you use our Website, sign up for a brand loyalty membership (each a "Loyalty Program"), use our mobile applications (each an "App") or shop in our stores (each a "Store") (collectively the "Services"). By using the Services, you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, then please do not use our Services.
PERSONAL INFORMATION
Personal information is information or an opinion that identifies you or that will enable your identity to be reasonably ascertained (including your name and contact details such as your residential or postal address, email address, date of birth or your telephone number).
Please note that any information which cannot be reasonably linked to your identity (e.g. IP address, browser information, favourite websites) does not constitute personal information and is not regulated by the Privacy Act.
Foot Looker collects information about you and its other customers using the Services and the information collected may vary depending on your particular interaction with Foot Locker, but will be limited to the information necessary to record and manage Foot Locker’s interaction with you or as permitted or required by law.
The personal information that Foot Locker collects is primarily related to its provision of the Services and by providing such personal information, you consent to your personal information being collected, stored, used and disclosed in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
INFORMATION COLLECTION
1. Information You Provide to Us. We only collect personal information from you when you provide it to us, such as when you: (1) register on our Website; (2) place an order; (3) complete a survey or product review; (4) participate in one of our promotions; (5) sign up for a Loyalty Program; or (6) contact us. The personal information we collect from you may include your name, age, mailing address, daytime telephone number, mobile phone number, e-mail address, account user name and password, and payment information. If you use a third party login to register or otherwise link to us, we may receive certain information about you from the third party (such as a social network) based on your registration and privacy settings on that third party service.
The provision of your personal information is entirely voluntary and you are entirely free to decide whether or not to give your personal information to us. However, you acknowledge and agree that if you do not provide sufficient or adequate information to us, we may not be able to provide you with a full range of Services or may not be able to fully assist you with your enquiry.
1. Registration. Registration on our Website or App helps us to provide you with a quick and simple checkout experience. We encourage you to register when shopping on our Website or App; however please note that registration is not required in order to shop with us. Our Registration Form requires users to provide contact information (such as name, age, mailing address, daytime telephone number, mobile phone number, e-mail address and password). You must be 18 years of age or older to register or have consent of a parent or legal guardian. The personal information you provide will be used to contact you concerning the status of an order, answer your questions and, if you choose to opt-in, to send you communications about upcoming sales, contests, promotions and product information. Please note that you will be able to opt-out of receiving such communications at any time.
You acknowledge and agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your registration information and password. You are responsible for all use of the Website or App under your registered account. If you would like, you can also fill out a customer profile. While it is not required, personal information obtained from the customer profile questions helps us to learn more about our customers and is used to improve your shopping experience and to provide you with more relevant content and advertising.

1. Third Party Service Providers. We may use third party service providers to provide you with more relevant online advertising based on your activities on our Website and third party sites. On our website we use the services of Google Analytics and Adobe Target for analysing aggregated non-personalised data.

We will not identify users or facilitate the merging of personal information with non-personal information collected through any Google advertising product or feature unless we have your explicit notice and your prior affirmative (i.e., opt-in) consent to that identification or merger. Irrespective of your consent, we will not attempt to disaggregate data that Google reports in aggregate.
