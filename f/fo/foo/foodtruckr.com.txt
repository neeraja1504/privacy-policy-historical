We care about how businesses use our information online, so it seems only fair that we disclose our privacy practices to you in easily understood terms.

Personal data is information that can be used to identify you such as your name, IP address, and email address. We process personal data from you in a number of ways including:

C. What Legal Basis Do We Have For Collecting and Processing Your Information?
Websites must have a legal basis for collecting information from individuals located in the European Union. Our legal basis for each of the ways we process your data is as follows.
(1) Purchases: We process your data as part of an allowed contractual transaction.
(2) Customer Service: A legitimate interest exists for providing you with answers to your questions. When you affirmatively contact us, your expectation is we will use your personal data to reply with an answer and we have a legitimate business interest in providing customers and potential customers with answers to their questions.
(3) Email Subscription: We will ask for your consent.
D. Who Has Access To The Data We Collect?
We process and access your data as described above through the help of third parties that have the digital infrastructure that we do not and without whom we would be unable to provide this site including:
• Payment processor
• Email and customer management solution
• Website design and maintenance provider
• Statistics tracker so we can understand how people find the site and what they do with it.
These third parties have made contractual promises to not use your personal data in any manner we do not authorize.
E. Cookies and Similar Technologies
We use cookies to track you. This tracking is done to provide you with ease of use as well as to provide us with information on how people move about the site, what is of interest to them and what is not, and incidental items such as what percentage of users access the site from a personal computer versus a mobile phone.

F. How Long Do We Keep Your Data?
We keep your personal data for different periods of time depending on the reason it was gathered in the first place.
(1) Purchases: We keep your payment data via a third party process for as long as you continue to interact with us as a paying member such as in the Mastermind Group. Once this is no longer the case, we will hold your information for an additional four years as part of our tax records should an audit arise.
(2) Customer Service: We will hold customer service personal data for a period of four years which covers the statute of limitations should a legal dispute arise between you and us.
