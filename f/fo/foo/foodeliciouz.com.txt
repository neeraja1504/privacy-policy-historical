COOKIES
What are cookies?
Cookies are small text files that are sent when you visit a website and stored in the browser of the user. If the corresponding Internet page is retrieved, the browser of the user sends back the content of the cookies and thus enables recognition of the user. Certain cookies are automatically deleted after the end of the browser session (so-called session cookies), others are stored for a predetermined time or permanently in the user’s browser and then delete themselves (so-called temporary or permanent cookies)
What data is stored in the cookies?
In cookies, no personal data is stored, but only an online identifier.
How can you prevent the use of cookies or delete cookies?
You can deactivate the storage of cookies via your browser settings and delete already stored cookies at any time in your browser (see the section “Technical notes”). Please note, however, that this online offering without cookies may not work or may only work to a limited extent.
Please note, furthermore, that contradictions against the creation of usage profiles partly work through a so-called “opt-out cookie”. If you delete all cookies, a contradiction may therefore no longer be taken into account and must be collected again by you.
What cookies do we use?
Analysis cookies
We use analysis cookies in order to be able to record the usage behavior (eg clicked advertising banners, visited sub-pages, made search queries) of our users and to evaluate them in statistical form.
Advertising cookies
We also use cookies for promotional purposes. Usage profiles created using these cookies (eg, clicked banner ads, visited subpages, requested search queries) are used by us to show you advertisements or offers that are tailored to your interests (“interest-based advertising”).
Advertising cookies of third parties
We also allow other companies to collect our users’ data through advertising cookies. This allows us and third parties to provide users of our online service with interest-based advertising based on an analysis of their usage behavior (eg, clicked banner ads, visited subpages, requested search queries), and not limited to our online offerings.
Yieldlove delivers advertising banners on behalf of its customers. All our banners use cookies. We place these banners on third-party websites, such as a news page, with the help of third-party providers.
For diagnostic purposes, troubleshooting, and detecting fraudulent behavior, we collect user information in cookies using our 6-month lifecycle. The captured user information includes user agent, device, HTTP referrer and the IP. This data is not retained for more than 7 days.
Yieldlove takes reasonable steps to protect any information we process from misuse, loss, unauthorized access, modification or notification. We take physical, electronic and procedural security measures to protect the data we process. By doing so, we restrict access to this information to authorized employees.
For the cookies that our third-party advertisers place for advertising purposes, we refer to the disclaimers that they have provided on the topic on their own websites. Note that we can only refer to these disclaimers, as they change regularly and Yieldlove has no control over them.
THIRD PARTIES AND OPT-OUT
A central contradiction possibility for different third-party suppliers in particular US-companies is also attainable under the following link: optout.networkadvertising.org But you can also opt-out separately for each company we work with.
