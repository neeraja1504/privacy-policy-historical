We will use your personal information to improve our Services to you, to contact you and to identify and authenticate your access to the Website´s services that you are authorized to access.
Only when you specifically agree, your personal information will be shared with third parties, for instance to provide you with FootballFans affiliated news or offers.

With the second option your personal information and posted content will not be displayed anymore after the deletion of your account.
By Dutch Law however, we are obligated to retain your personal information for at least 6 months. Your personal information will therefore be stored on the FootballFans servers, even after deletion or termination of your account.
Personal information should be treated and stored in a secured manner. Apart from the fact that FootballFans uses SSL to offer secure communications by encrypting personal information to and from the Website, our servers are based in a secure environment behind a dedicated firewall.

No one at FootballFans or Itude Sports Interattractive B.V. has access to your password.
The personal information you provide to FootballFans is not visible for search engines, except for your username and public information such as your country, your website information, reports, videos and photos you may post.
As stated, FootballFans protects your personal information, both during transmission and in storage. It is however impossible to guarantee its absolute security, although we take all the necessary and appropriate measures within our capabilities.
If you have any questions about security on our Website, you can contact us via the Contact link at each page, or send an e-mail to us at info@footballfans.eu.
We will comply with demands made by law enforcement or other governmental officials in response to a verified request relating a criminal investigation.
When creating an account, you agree that certain personal information (pointed out under Security of your Personal Data) of your account will be visible for other users of the Website.
You understand and acknowledge that every time you use FootballFans by adding material or information for others to see, this can become public. When adding material like photos, videos or comments and reports, you should be aware that anything you submit can be read, collected, or used by others that visit the Website, and can as a result be used to send you unsolicited messages. You should therefore understand and acknowledge that whenever you provide information as described (by entering messages, posting photos, videos, comments and reports), you do so at your own risk.
FootballFans is not responsible for the Personal information you choose to share with others via our Website, and cannot control the actions of other users with whom you may choose to share data and information.

You should always be cautious when providing others with personal information.
If you choose to invite friends to FootballFans via FootballFans.eu, the names and e-mail addresses of the invitees will need to be entered on the Website. The names and e-mail addresses of the people that are invited will be used by FootballFans only to send an invitation e-mail (including an optional personal message) and corresponding reminders. FootballFans stores this information to send the invitation e-mail, to register a contact connection if the invitation is accepted, and to track the success of the FootballFans referral program.
For technical and operational reasons it may be necessary for your (personal) information to be transferred to (servers of) companies affiliated to us and/or advertisers to countries outside the European Union (EU), where the regulations in the field of privacy protection might not provide the same protection as in the EU. Insofar as this is necessary, you hereby agree that your (personal) information can be transferred to countries outside the EU.
