We may collect and store information about you in connection with your use of the Service, including any information you transmit to or through the Service, such as when you download our games, enter information on our website, subscribe to our newsletter or community forum, make an in-app purchase, request technical support, or otherwise contact us and provide your information.
We generally collect or receive information in three ways: (1) you voluntarily provide information to us, such as by creating an account, or signing up for email alerts, (2) we collect information automatically, such as through cookies or our games and other software, and (3) third parties, such as ad networks or social networks, may provide information to us.  Each of these methods is described in more detail below.
Information You Choose to Provide to Us
We may ask you to provide us with certain categories of information, such as: (1) personally identifiable information, which is information that identifies you personally, such as your first and last name, phone number, gender, birth date, credit card, mailing address, username and password, location and email address (“Personal Information”).
The Personal Information we collect may vary depending on the Service you are using.   The following are some examples in which you may choose to provide Personal Information to us:
When you choose to register for an account to use our website or Service;
When you choose to download or play our games using your mobile device;
When you purchase something from us (e.g. when you make an in-app purchase) or otherwise engage in a transaction with us;
When you contact us for any reason (e.g.  through “contact us” forms), including for technical support or customer service; or
When you choose to subscribe to our emails or to receive other information from us.
Information Automatically Collected When You Use Our Service
We typically aggregate the data that we collect automatically and use it in statistical form to determine trends among groups of users, rather than using it to identify individuals. If the information collected automatically identifies you as an individual we will treat it as Personal Information.
The following are examples of information we may automatically collect:
your IP address, UDID or other unique identifier (“Device Identifier”).  A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device used to access the Service, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier;
your Device functionality (including browser, operating system, hardware, mobile network information);
Usage information and statistics about your interaction with our websites, games, and applications, which may include the URLs of our websites that you have visited, URLs of referring and exiting pages, page views, time spent on a page, number of clicks, platform type, the application you used or the game you played, how long you used or played it and when, and other usage statistics;
your Device location;
Technical information your Device characteristics (such as device make and model, information about device operating systems and browsers, or other device or system related specifications); and
certain other Device data, including the time of day, among other information.
We may use various methods and technologies to collect and store information automatically (“Tracking Technologies”) when you use or interact with the Service. This information may be stored or accessed using Tracking Technologies that may be downloaded to your personal computer, browser, laptop, tablet, mobile phone or other device (a “Device”).
A few of the Tracking Technologies include, without limitation, the following (and subsequent technology and methods later developed):  Cookies, advertising identifiers (including mobile identifiers such as Apple’s IDFA or Google’s Advertising ID), web beacons, tags, embedded scripts, local shared objects such as HTML5 and Flash (sometimes called "flash cookies"), advertising identifiers (including mobile identifiers such as Apple’s IDFA or Google’s Advertising ID), Browser Fingerprinting, ETags and similar technology in connection with your use of the Service, third party websites, games, and mobile applications.   For more information about some of these Tracking Technologies
The purposes for which we use Tracking Technologies in the Service include:
Purpose
|
Explanation
---|---
Processes
|
Intended to make the Service work in the way you expect. For example, we use a Tracking Technology that tells us whether you have already signed up for an account.
Authentication, Security, and Compliance
|
Intended to prevent fraud, protect your data from unauthorized parties, and comply with legal requirements. For example, we use Tracking Technology to determine if you are logged in and to remember you and your Device and for fraud prevention.
Preferences
|
Intended to remember information about how you prefer the Service to behave and look. For example, we use a Tracking Technology that tells us information from that provider so that you can enjoy the same game on multiple devices, pick up where you left-off, and interact with your friends.
Notifications
|
Intended to allow or prevent notices of information or options that we think could improve your use of the Service. For example, we use a Tracking Technology that stops us from showing you the signup notification if you have already seen it.
Advertising
|
Intended to make advertising more relevant to users and more valuable to advertisers. For example, we may use Tracking Technologies to serve you interest-based ads, such as ads that are displayed to you based on your game preferences, or to tell us if you have recently clicked on an ad.
Analytics
|
Intended to help us understand how users use the Service. For example, we use a Cookie that tells us your interaction with a game (e.g. how long you played a game and usage statistics) to tell us how our games are performing and help us improve our games.
We may supplement the information we collect directly from you on our Service with outside records from third parties for various purposes, including so that we can deliver the Service you have requested, to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you, and to offer you opportunities that may be of interest to you.
We collect this information:
when you download our games and Service via Apple’s App Store, the Google Play Store, or other online platforms.  These parties may provide us with information regarding your account or registration, but they do not give us your payment information. Because these organizations determine what information they will collect from you, it may vary according to their services, but it is likely to include information such as your name, email address, user ID, location, and date of birth.
when you use our games and applications at third-party websites, use a third party service like Google, or log into the Service via a social media account such as Facebook.  For example, social networks may provide us with certain information about you from your profile on their website such as contact information, demographics, and other information you provided to that website such as your photo, user name, and potentially any and all information that you agreed the social network or other party could provide to us when you use our games and applications.
when you use social features of our games and applications, which allows us to receive information about you from social networks such as your social network user ID, your profile picture, and the user IDs and profile pictures of your connections.  These social features promote and facilitate the interaction among players and allow you to find out if your friends are actively playing the game and using the feature, to find out if they used it in the past, and to invite them to join with you to meet a game challenge. If you choose to use one of our social features, you may be asked to log into a social network through our game or application.
when you request information from or provide information to third parties.  For example, you may be presented with an option on our Service to receive certain information and/or marketing offers directly from third parties or to have us send certain information to third parties or give them access to it.
Please note, third parties may retain any information used or provided in any such communications or other activities and these third parties’ practices are not subject to our Privacy Policy.  For example, if you post content to a third-party service through the Service, that third party service will also receive that content, which will be visible to anyone that has access to it through that third-party service. Further, when you use third-party sites or services, you are using their services and not our services and they, not we, are responsible for their practices or use of their use of your information. You should review the applicable third-party privacy policies before using such third-party tools on our Service.
We and our third-party service providers may use your information to:
enable us to optimize our games for you and for the Device that you are using, as well as to deliver customized in game offers and promotions;
personalize your gaming experience on the Service, or to serve you specific content that is relevant to you, including using your location information to display advertisements;
fulfill your requests, process transactions, for example, to enable us to provide our games and other Service to you, to ensure that any purchases you make are verified on our servers and activated in the games, and to provide you with player support if you need it;
to contact you with regard to your use of the Service and, in our discretion, changes to the Service and/or Service’s policies;
notify you of traffic reports or provide other information we make available through the Service, including to identify your game and Service preferences;
improve the Service’s quality, engage in research and analysis relating to the Service, track usage of the Service, and provide feedback to third party advertisers that are listed on the Service;
provide customer support, message you, back up our systems, allow for disaster recovery, enhance the security of the Service, and
to comply with legal obligations.
We may share non-Personal Information, such as aggregated user statistics, with third parties such as ad networks and content distributors. For example, we may disclose the number of users that have been exposed to, or clicked on, advertisements. We may also disclose anonymized information about your use, for example if you engage in a transaction such as an in-app purchase, we may publicly disclose information about the transaction without providing identifying information about you or otherwise disclosing your participation in the transaction.
Further, we may share your Device Identifiers with third parties along with data related to you and your activities.  We do not share your Personal Information that we have collected directly from you on the Service with third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes unless you have consented (either through an opt-in our opt-out opportunity) at the time you provide your Personal Information.
In addition, we may share the information we have collected about you, including Personal Information, as disclosed at the time you provide your information and as described below (or otherwise in this Privacy Policy) for various purposes, including:
where we have your consent to do so.  For example, to provide you with Service that you have requested - and that we have agreed - to provide to you, such as our games, customer services, chat functionality and third party social network connectivity;
as reasonably necessary in order to provide the Service to you (for example, by providing your Personal Information to service providers we may use to fulfil the Service) or to protect the rights, property, or safety of FGL, our users, or others;
as we reasonably believe is permitted by law or regulation or as is necessary to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our Terms of Service and/or any other agreement with you;
with our subsidiaries and affiliates (“Affiliates”) and/or if there is a sale of the assets of FGL or corporate restructuring, or as a result of a change of control of FGL or one of its affiliated companies, or in preparation of any of these events. Any third party to which FGL transfers of sells FGL’s assets will have the right to continue to use the Personal Information and other information that you provide to us in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy;
Developers using our analytics will have ongoing access to data about the users of their games and apps and any associated data, such as user ID, device ID, app ID, purchasing data, and actions completed within their games;
Advertising:
We may utilize the data collected from developers’ apps to place personalized ads in developers’ apps and elsewhere. This usage will permit other parties, such as publishers and attribution companies, to learn about the Devices that received, viewed or interacted with ads.
As discussed above in the purposes and reasons for our Tracking Technologies, we may permit advertisers and their agents to use cookies or related Tracking Technologies within the Service to store information on or read information from your browser or device so that they can optimize their advertising campaigns, including to frequency cap and deliver targeted ads.
We also may share certain limited information, such as Device identifiers, with advertisers and other marketing partners for purposes of gauging the effectiveness of advertising and other marketing strategies;
Third Party Service Providers.  We may also share your information with our service providers if necessary to enable them to provide services to us, such as hosting the Service, designing and/or operating the Service’s features, network security, tracking the Service’s activities and analytics, payment processing, marketing of the Service, and enabling us to perform other administrative services and functions.  We may also share information from or about you with these third-party providers so that they can perform their services or complete your requests. These third-party providers may share information with us that they obtain from or about you in connection with providing their services or completing your requests. Third-party analytics and other service providers may set and access their own Tracking Technologies on your Device and they may otherwise collect or have access to information about you, potentially including Personal Information, about you.  We are not responsible for those third-party technologies or activities arising out of them.  However, some may offer you certain choices regarding their practices. We are not responsible for the effectiveness of or compliance with any third parties’ opt-out options.
Please note, some of our partners are outside United States. For a list of some, but not all, business partners that we actively share your information with (this list is subject to change) [CLICK ](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.fgl.com/partner-list.php&sa=D&ust=1529351646316000)[HERE](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.fgl.com/partner-list.php&sa=D&ust=1529351646317000)[].
We provide you with choices about whether to provide us with Personal Information and whether it is shared. We generally only ask you for Personal Information that is necessary to provide the Service you request. You can choose not to give us the Personal Information we request, as described in the “Information You Voluntarily Choose to Provide” section of this policy. However, in some cases, if you decide not to provide the Personal Information we request, we will not be able to provide the game, application, service, information, or features you requested.
Other examples of your choices include:
If you have elected to receive direct marketing communications from us, you can change your mind at any time by following the opt out link in any marketing communication that is sent to you.
You can browse our website without providing any Personal Information. We may collect some limited information automatically, as described above..
You may be able to limit our sharing of some of this information through your mobile device settings, as further described below
You can change your privacy settings on other parties’ websites, such as social networks, which will stop or limit our receipt of information from those other websites. You also may choose not to use social features we make available. If you choose to use these features, you should refrain from posting Personal Information that will be visible to others, such as including your email address in a forum or during a chat.
You may change your browser settings or take other steps to block, manage, or delete cookies. Not all of our websites and online services currently respond to browser “do not track” signals, so you will need to use your browser settings to effectively manage cookies. In some cases, blocking or disabling cookies may cause our websites, games, and applications not to work as intended and some features may not be available.
You can limit interest-based advertising by opting out at www.aboutads.info/choices/ or www.networkadvertising.org/choices/. If you are located in Europe, more information is available at www.youronlinechoices.eu/.  Please note that opting out does not prevent the display of all advertisements to you.
You could also reset your mobile advertising identifier or limit ad tracking altogether using the settings in your phone.
You can delete our games from your mobile device.
You can also amend your choices by sending an email to us as detailed in the “How to Contact Us” section below. For example, you can opt out of certain types of processing that we undertake and where any processing is based on your consent, you can withdraw that consent at any time. Nonetheless, if you play our games we will still collect some personal data about you and process it as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not wish us to collect any personal data about you at all, you should cease playing our games and stop using our Service.
Mobile Device Tracking
As of the Effective Date of this policy, Apple and Google offered the owners of devices that use their operating systems (iOS and Android) with options for limiting tracking and targeting in relation to ads. Please note that changing any of these settings does not prevent the display of certain advertisements to you. FGL does not control your device-level opt-out processes and is not responsible for any choices you make through such a mechanism or for the continued availability, accuracy, effectiveness, or location of that mechanism.
If you use an Apple device, go here.
If you use an Android device, navigate to the Google Settings page, select Ads and then choose to reset your Android Ad ID or opt-out of personalized ads.
To learn about options for many mobile ad networks, go here.

We will transfer your personal information for any of the purposes identified in this policy to our subsidiaries, affiliates, service providers, and business partners that may be located outside of the jurisdiction where you are located.  The laws in those jurisdictions may not provide the same level of data protection compared to the laws in your country.  However, we will treat your personal information as subject to the protections described in this policy.
