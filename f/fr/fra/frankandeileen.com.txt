Children Under 13
This Site is restricted to the use of adults over the age of majority in their place of residence.  No portion of the Site is directed to children under the age of 13.  Consequently, we do not knowingly collect personal identifying information from any person we know is a child under the age of 13.  If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 we will delete that information as quickly as possible.  If you are a parent or guardian of a child under 13 years of age and you believe your child has provided us with Personal Information, please contact us at customercare@frankandeileen.com.
Do Not Track
Although some browsers currently offer a “do not track (‘DNT’) option,” no common industry standard for DNT exists.  We therefore do not currently commit to responding to browsers’ DNT signals.
Your California Privacy Rights
Under certain circumstances, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 states that, upon receipt of a request by a California customer, a business may be required to provide information regarding how that business has shared personal information of customers with third parties for direct marketing purposes.  However, the foregoing does not apply to businesses like ours that do not disclose personal information to third parties for direct marketing purposes.
Your Rights and Obligations
We ask that you keep the Personal Data that you provide to us current and that you correct any information you have provided us by contacting us at customercare@frankandeileen.com _.   _You represent and warrant that all Personal Data you provide us is true and correct and relates to you and not to any other person.
