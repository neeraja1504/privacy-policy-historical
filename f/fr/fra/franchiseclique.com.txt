Privacy Policy | Franchise Clique
Effective on May 20, 2016
This privacy policy describes how Franchise Clique, owned and operated by Franchise Clique collects and uses the personal information you provide on our website: https://www.franchiseclique.com. At Franchise Clique, we only use personal information that you provide in the way we specify when we collect it. We take our privacy seriously, and this policy covers data used in our websites, mobile apps, email, and text-messaging services.
Our Website
All users can view content on our website without submitting any personal information (such as name, address, phone number, etc.) to us. However, in order to provide you with a better user experience, we may collect non-personal information from your computer using cookies. More information on this process is below.
Mobile Apps and Location Information
When you download or use our mobile apps, you may give permission to share your device's real-time location (from cell towers or GPS). This information is used to provide services like localized search results. You can disable location-sharing at any time in your device settings. We also use an encrypted version of your device's unique device ID to track app usage, and to send any mobile alerts that you ask you to receive.
Our Information Request Form
When you request information by submitting your contact information (name, address, phone number, e-mail, etc.) on our registration form, we pass your information only to the businesses that you specify. No other business receives your contact information. Your information, however, is often stored in the receiving company's database, as well as ours. Collected data may be stored in a database outside your home country.
Our Newsletter Program
We offer opportunities to register to receive our e-mail newsletter, both in various locations on our website and on our Information Request Form. We only add you to our mailing list if you authorize us to. Out of respect for your privacy, you may choose to stop receiving our newsletter or marketing emails by following the unsubscribe instructions included in these emails, accessing our unsubscribe page, or you can contact us at info@franchiseclique.com. Moreover, we do not share your e-mail address or other personal information with other companies unless authorized by you.
Passive Information Collection
The Site automatically collects information and may also customize your visit through technical means, including the following:
Cookies: Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer's hard drive by computers (or servers) to identify your computer.
Web Beacons: Web beacons (also known as pixel tags, internet tags, clear GIFs, or single-pixel GIFs) are electronic images embedded into a webpage.
IP Address Logs: Franchise Clique also logs Internet Protocol (IP) addresses - the location of your computer on the internet.
Cookies allow Franchise Clique to recognize you when you visit the Site, to personalize your experience and generally to serve you better. For example, if you enter your name, address, or ZIP code on one of the Site's forms, it may be stored in a cookie so you do not have to enter it again on other forms on the Site. Cookies and web beacons can tell us what advertising you have seen on the Site, which allows Franchise Clique to offer you a more diverse selection of advertising information and also may be used together to measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns. Cookies, web beacons, and IP addresses are also used to compile data regarding Site usage (e.g., what website you came from, what pages of the Site you visit, how long you were on the Site, what type of browser you are using, what website you went to). Web beacons may also be included in emails sent by Franchise Clique to determine when and if such emails are opened or forwarded. You can disable cookies or otherwise manage them through tools provided with your browser software and with third-party software packages. If you turn off cookies, many of the Site's features will not work as well or at all. Anonymous information regarding use of our Site and services that is collected and/or aggregated by or on behalf of Franchise Clique through the use of such technical means or otherwise is referred to in this Statement as "Usage Data."
Information Use
Personally identifiable information collected by Franchise Clique through your use of the Site may be stored on servers or in a cookie on your computer and may be used by Franchise Clique for any of the following purposes:
To confirm or fulfill a request that you make.
To follow up on any request that you have previously made.
To communicate with you regarding the Franchise Clique service.
To send promotional materials, newsletters or other content via email or otherwise. If you no longer wish to receive a particular email newsletter or other promotion from Franchise Clique, you must follow the opt-out instructions included in such email newsletters and promotions.
To permit third parties (to whom Franchise Clique may disclose personally identifiable information specifically for direct marketing purposes) to send you promotional or informational messages, but only if you have first affirmatively agreed to receive such messages.
To improve your user experience.
To manage Franchise Clique's business and its relationships with Affiliates, customers, and other third parties to which Franchise Clique may disclose personally identifiable information pursuant to this Statement.
For Site administration, analysis, research, development, optimization and other internal purposes, including, without limitation, to compile Usage Data.
Usage Data
Usage Data is used by Franchise Clique for administrative, analytical, research, optimization, and other purposes. For example, Franchise Clique may use statistical analyses of Usage Data in order to measure interest in the various areas of the Site, for development purposes, and to inform advertisers and partners in aggregate and anonymous terms about consumers who click on their advertising or other messages. IP addresses are also used for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes.
With respect to promotional materials and newsletters that Franchise Clique may send from time to time, Franchise Clique will not continue to send you such communications if you ask us not to, as described below. However, you agree that Franchise Clique may send to you, and you cannot opt out of, communications of a transactional or relationship nature, including, but not limited to, communications regarding fraudulent or illegal activity, the status of your SIY Account, changes to this Statement or the Franchise Clique Terms of Service, as well as communications to confirm, fulfill and follow up on your SIY Account registration or a request submitted through the Site.
Information Sharing
Franchise Clique com may share personally identifiable information that you provide with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy statement and in the following cases:
Affiliates. Franchise Clique may share your personally identifiable information with Affiliates on the condition that the Affiliates' disclosure and use of the information is consistent with this Statement.
Requests. If you request information or services through the Site, you agree that Franchise Clique may share personally identifiable information with third parties as may be necessary to provide such information to or perform such services for you. For example, if you use the Site's Information Request Form to request information, Franchise Clique will share the information you entered with applicable parties (or its designee). Franchise Clique may also share the personally identifiable information you submit as part of the request with the franchisor and/or its affiliates. Similarly, if through the Site you request additional information from a financial institution, Franchise Clique will share your information with that institution. Personally identifiable information also may be included in reports to these third parties, but only when you have intended to submit the information to the third party as described above. After the information is provided to such third parties, the subsequent use or disclosure of such information is subject to those third parties' privacy policies and practices and Franchise Clique does not control their subsequent use or disclosure of information.
Sweepstakes/Promotions. In the event that you participate in a sweepstakes, contest, or other promotion on the Site that is sponsored by Franchise Clique and a third party, Franchise Clique reserves the right to share personally identifiable information collected in conjunction with the sweepstakes, contest, or promotion with the third party. After the information is provided to such third parties, the subsequent use or disclosure of such information is subject to those third parties' privacy policies and practices.
Direct Marketing. Except as provided herein, it is Franchise Clique's policy not to disclose personally identifiable information of our customers to third parties specifically for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. If you are 18 years of age or older and have affirmatively agreed to receive third-party direct marketing materials, Franchise Clique may share personally identifiable information with third parties for direct marketing purposes. Although Franchise Clique will notify all third-party direct marketers that the information provided to them is confidential, the subsequent use or disclosure of such information is subject to those third parties' privacy policies and practices.
Service Providers. Franchise Clique may work with third parties that provide services on its behalf, including, among others, providers of analytical, development, promotional, research, credit card processing, technical and other services. For example, Franchise Clique may ask that a third party conduct an online survey or sweepstakes or send newsletters on its behalf. Similarly, if you make a payment to Franchise Clique by credit card, Franchise Clique may share your personally identifiable information and credit card information with a third party in order to process credit card transactions, or such information may be collected directly by the credit card processing service provider on Franchise Clique's behalf. In such cases, Franchise Clique asks that the third party maintain your personally identifiable information as confidential and use the information only to perform the services specified by Franchise Clique.
Email List Opt-Outs. In the event Franchise Clique sends promotional emails to you on behalf of third-party advertisers and you inform Franchise Clique you wish to opt out of future promotional emails from a particular third party, Franchise Clique may share your email address with that third party so the third party may add you to its opt-out lists.
Other. Franchise Clique expressly reserves the right to release any personally identifiable information or other information you provide to third parties under the following circumstances: (a) when required by law or legal process, (b) to investigate and/or take action against illegal activity, suspected abuse or unauthorized use of the Site, (c) to protect the property or safety of our users or others, (d) to enforce our Terms of Service and (e) in connection with any sale or other transfer of ownership of all or a part of Franchise Clique. Further, if you make any personally identifiable information publicly available on the Site, Franchise Clique reserves the right to disclose such information to third parties, including, without limitation, insurance companies and Franchise Clique's Affiliates and third-party distribution partners.
Please note that the messages that Franchise Clique sends to you to confirm, fulfill, or follow up on a request may incidentally include promotional material or other content from Franchise Clique or its partners. In the case of these messages, Franchise Clique is not sharing your personally identifiable information with those third parties. Franchise Clique reserves the right to share Usage Data with any third party for any reason.
