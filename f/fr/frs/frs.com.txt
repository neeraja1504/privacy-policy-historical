How Do We Collect and Use This Information?
Personal Information.   We collect the personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you use the Web Site.  For example, if you purchase a product from the Web Site, we will collect any information that you provide to us in any such transaction.  We use your personal information primarily for our own internal purposes, such as providing, maintaining, evaluating, and improving the Web Site, evaluating and fulfilling requests for purchases, and conducting follow-up marketing efforts.
Other Information.   Like the operators of most web sites, we may use tracking software and similar technology, which automatically collects information about your computer hardware and software, and use of the Web Site.  This information may be used by us for the operation of the Web Site and to provide general statistics regarding use of the Web Site.  Many commercial web site operators collect this information in similar ways.
Cookies.   Cookies are bits of electronic information that a web site can transfer to a visitor’s hard drive to help tailor and keep records of his or her visit.  Cookies allow web site operators to better customize visits to the site to the visitor’s individual preferences.  Many commercial web sites use cookies.  Although most web browsers automatically accept cookies, you can usually change your browser to prevent or notify you whenever you are sent a cookie.  This gives you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it.  However, if you set your browser such that it does not accept cookies, you may not be able to access certain of the features on the Web Site.

How Do We Protect Your Personal Information?
Whenever we obtain your personal information, we will implement and maintain reasonable practices to protect your personal information from unauthorized access or disclosure.  While we will use such efforts, we cannot and will not act as insurers of the security of your personal information.  Accordingly, we assume no liability for any disclosure of data due to errors in transmission, unauthorized third party access or other acts of third parties, or acts or omissions beyond our reasonable control.
