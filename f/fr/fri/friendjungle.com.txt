Overview
As part of the normal operation of our services we collect information about you in order to offer the highest possibility of finding a partner through our site. As a matter of policy, we do not sell, rent, or give any personally identifiable information about you to any third party; except for in cases where our terms and conditions may have been broken.
Information you supply
If you have started, but not completed, the registration process, we may send you email messages encouraging you to complete the process and become a subscriber. Once you complete the registration process, we may also occasionally send you newsletters and email you notifications of special events or information on users that are establishing contact with you through our site. If you would rather not receive emails about new products, promotions or other noteworthy news, you may opt-out by visiting the "Settings" section. We further offer a subscriber-based service to users seeking partners. To process subscriptions we may require your name, billing address, phone number, email address and credit card information. Credit card transactions are processed through a third party billing company, which only uses your information for that purpose. In the event that we are acquired by another company, your personal information may be part of the assets transferred to the acquiring party. If this occurs, you will be notified if there are any material changes to the way your personally identifiable information is collected or used.
