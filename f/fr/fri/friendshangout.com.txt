Privacy Policy
FriendsHangout.com is committed to respecting and protecting the privacy of those who use FriendsHangout.com. This statement outlines how we handle any personal information we obtain.
From time to time, we may ask for information that personally identifies you, as in user surveys or orders placed through our site. We use this information to operate this site, provide you with the highest quality services and offer you opportunities we think will be of interest.
You also may choose to provide personal information by participating in various forums we intend to offer for readers. You should remember that when you yourself voluntarily disclose personal information to other Internet users, such as when you include personal information in a posting to an online discussion forum, that information could be used by others and may result in unsolicited messages or other forms of attention.
We use IP addresses to analyze traffic and administer this site. IP addresses track individual computers and do not contain personally identifiable data.
In order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers and others, we may disclose user information, but only in a form that does not identify individual users. For example, we might disclose that a certain percentage of our users are from US households or within a certain age range.
Privacy of Minors
We are committed to comply with the requirements of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (“COPPA”). COPPA defines a "Child" as anyone under the age of 13. Children are not eligible to use the site unsupervised. If you are under the age of 13, you may only use this site in conjunction with and under the supervision of your parents or guardians. Internet safety experts have advised that children do not fully appreciate the risk of providing too much personal information online or communicating with strangers they encounter online.
