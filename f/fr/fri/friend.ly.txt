Somo Enterprises, Inc., the owner and operator of the Friend.ly properties, respects your privacy and is committed to protecting the personal information that you may provide to us or that we may collect while you are using our web sites or our games, applications, software, or related services made accessible through our web sites or through other online access points.
1.     ** SCOPE OF THIS POLICY**

From time to time, we may add new web sites other than those listed above, but they will provide a link to this Policy and will be governed by its terms.  Such web sites are included in the definition of the "Site," as that term is used in this Policy.
References in this Policy to " Somo ," " Friend.ly ," " we ," " us ," and " our " refer to Somo Enterprises, Inc. and its affiliates.
2.     ** PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT**
We may collect various types of personal information about you, including personally identifiable information.  "Personally identifiable information" means information that can be used to identify or contact you, such as your name, address, telephone number, mobile number, or e-mail address.
We may collect personal information in a number of ways through the Site, Software, and Services, such as when you provide it voluntarily to us in connection with registering, creating a profile, sending an e-mail or other type of message to us or another user, or participating in interactive forums or features of the Site, the Software, or the Services.  If we collect information from you off-line and it is linked with personal information, we will treat that information as personal information.  Some personal information may also be automatically collected through the use of the Site, Software, or Services, as described below. **  **When you engage in fee-based activities, you will be required to provide necessary billing information such as your real name, credit card or other payment information, and street address.
Personal information does not include aggregate information, which is data we collect about the use of the Site, the Software, and the Services, or categories of users and uses, from which personal information has been removed.  Aggregate data is used for a number of purposes, such as to help us understand user needs and preferences so that we can improve our products and services.  Aggregate data includes anonymous, aggregated profiling and session data derived from information that you have provided to us through surveys, questionnaires, polls, etc., but which is not tied to any personal information.  Aggregated anonymous information also includes information about site usage and the customer base.
As part of the registration process for some services, you may be asked to provide information that does not personally identify you. For example, you may be asked to provide information concerning your entertainment preferences, purchasing habits, and the like.  This information is generally optional but may be included in your account profile and tied to personal information.  We request this information in order to understand you better and to also bring to your attention new services, programs, or offers that may be of interest to you.
In many cases, we will automatically collect certain non-personal information about your use of the Site, Software, or Services.  We might collect, among other things, information concerning the type of Internet browser or computer operating system you are using, the domain name of your Internet service provider, your "click path" through the Site, your Internet protocol addressing and traffic information, and the web site or advertisement that was linked to or from the Site when you visited.  To do this, we may use cookies and other technology (see below).  Your visits to the Site, and information provided through these technologies, will be anonymous, unless you provide us with personal information or have provided such information in the past.  For example, if you've created a premium subscription account, your account information (including name, email address, and billing and shipping information) may be linked to items you purchase at the Site or through the Software or Services (i.e., purchasing history).
A Special Note About Information Disclosed to Us by Third Parties.  In some cases, third parties to whom you have provided your personal information — e.g., the operator or controller of a third-party web site or other online access point from which you have accessed the Software or Services — may share your personal information with us.  As highlighted above, any personal information that you have provided to a third party is subject to that third party's privacy policy, including, if applicable, any "privacy settings" that you may have selected as part of your management of your account with that third party.  Such information is not subject to this Policy.  However, because we are committed to protecting the personal information of our users, we will use reasonable efforts to protect such information as if it were personal information that you had disclosed to us pursuant to this Policy.
3.     ** USES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**
We use personal information that we collect to process your requests or transactions; to provide you the Service; to provide you with other information or services you request from time-to-time; to inform you about other information, events, promotions, products, or services we think will be of interest to you; to learn more about and improve the Services; and for the purpose for which information was provided.  For example, personal information may be used to:
•    Provide you with the services you request and to complete any transactions or enable the use of any features;
•     Send you a welcoming or account-related or customer service e-mail;
•     Identify other users of the Site, Software, and Services with whom we believe you may be compatible and with whom we believe you may      want to communicate (each, a " Match "), and notify you and such other users of each such Match;

4.     ** SHARING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**
We do not sell or rent personal information to third parties or share personal information with third parties, except as described in this Policy or with your consent.  We may provide access to or share personal information with consultants, vendors, and service providers (" Service Providers ") who perform functions on our behalf in order to carry out their work.
The Site, Software, or Services, may include certain online communities and other interactive features in connection with which you may choose to create a user profile (including, but not limited to, a "public profile").  We may display the information that you include in your user profile to other users of the Site, Software, or Services, including members of the community and, in the case of your public profile, to visitors.  In connection with the creation of your user profile, you may choose to provide us with information and content — for example, your photos and videos — that is in addition to the other information that you provide to us or that we collect (as further described in this Policy).  By providing us with such additional information and content, you agree that we may make that additional information and content available to other users of the Site, Software, or Services, including members of the community and, in the case of such additional information and content that you include in your public profile, to visitors.
We also may share your information with law enforcement or other appropriate authorities, our business partners, or other third parties if we have a reasonable, good-faith belief that the disclosure of such information to such parties is necessary or advisable in order to:  (a) comply with legal process; (b) enforce our rights and agreements, including our rules, policies, and guidelines; (c) respond to claims that any content that you have posted or otherwise made available on the Site or through the Software violates the rights of third parties, including the legal rights of any of our partners; (d) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of us, our employees, our business, our users, our business partners, or the general public (including, but not limited to, victims of abuse — see below); or (e) prevent and protect us and our users from illicit, fraudulent, abusive, unlawful, or unauthorized use of the Site, Software, or Services.  Your personal information also may be disclosed or transferred as part of, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition or in any other situation where personal information may be transferred as one of our business assets.
A Special Note About Potential Victims of Abuse.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Policy or our Terms and Service, we reserve the right, but have no obligation, to disclose any information that you submit to us, if in our sole opinion, we suspect or have reason to suspect, that the information involves a party who may be the victim of abuse in any form.  Abuse may include, without limitation, elder abuse, child abuse, spousal abuse, neglect, or domestic violence.  Information may be disclosed to authorities that we, in our sole discretion, deem appropriate to handle such disclosure.  Appropriate authorities may include, without limitation, law enforcement agencies, child protection agencies, or court officials. You understand and acknowledge that we are permitted to make such disclosure.
5.     ** ONLINE COMMUNITIES**
As mentioned above, the Site, Software, and Services may include certain online communities and other interactive features, such as user profiles (including public profiles), forums, message boards, and chat rooms.  You may be asked to provide your name in order to participate in certain features of the Site, Software, or Services.  In many cases, the Site and the Software automatically will use your first name as your user identification (or ID) in connection with such features.  As such, your first name likely will be available to and accessible by the general public while you participate in such features.  Further, information you post in any public areas of the Site or through the Software or Services is publicly available and may be shared with other users.  To the extent that you create a public profile that may be available to others users, you are solely responsible for its content and accuracy at all times.  To edit, change, or delete such information or change your privacy preferences, follow the instructions on the Site or available through the Software.  Although we strive to use reasonable efforts to implement these privacy preferences, no system or security measure is perfect or impenetrable.  You should always be cautious when giving out personal information to others in public online forums.  We are not responsible for protecting such information that you may disclose to third parties through our Site, Software, or Services (e.g. sending your contact information to another user via a forum, message board, or chat room).
IF PARENTS OF MINORS CHOOSE TO ALLOW THEIR CHILDREN TO USE THE SITE, SOFTWARE, OR SERVICES, WE STRONGLY ENCOURAGE SUCH PARENTS TO CAREFULLY SUPERVISE THEIR CHILDREN'S ACTIVITY IN ANY AND ALL PUBLIC FORUMS AND TO CAUTION THEIR CHILDREN NOT TO SHARE ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION (SEE BELOW).
6.     ** USE OF COOKIES AND WEB BEACONS**
The Site and some Services and advertisements on our Site, may contain "cookies."  A cookie is a piece of data that is sent to your web browser, which stores the cookie on your computer if your browser is enabled to accept cookies.  "Web beacons" (also known as clear gifs and "web bugs") assist in the delivery of cookies.  We use cookies and web beacons, and also frames, server log analysis, and other technology, to customize your experience with our Site and the Service.  We do not link personally identifiable information to web beacons nor do we transfer any data collected through web beacons to third parties.  Most internet browsers will allow you to erase cookies from your hard drive, block acceptance of cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored.  If you block cookies, some portions of the Site, Software, or Service may not function properly.
We do not control cookies in third-party advertisements, and we encourage you to check the privacy policies of advertisers and/or advertising services to learn about their use of cookies, web beacons, and other technology.  We may also use a third-party advertising company to display advertisements on the Site.  These companies may use information about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements on this Site and other web sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you.

We strive to protect personal information while it is under our control.  If you elect to become a registered user of the Site, Software, or Services, your Friend.ly account information is accessible online only through the use of a Friend.ly password.  However, as mentioned above, there may be numerous circumstances in which you will use or access the Software or the Services through a web site or other online access point operated and controlled by a third-party, in which case any information related to the account that you maintain with such third party is subject to that third party's privacy policy, including, if applicable, any "privacy settings" that you may have selected as part of your management of your account with that third party and the account password that you maintain with such third party.  To help protect the confidentiality of personal information, you must keep your passwords confidential and not disclose them to any other person.  You are responsible for your account names, passwords, and other user identifications (or IDs) and all uses of the Site, Software, and Services by any person using your account names, passwords, or other user IDs, and you acknowledge that it is solely your responsibility to maintain the confidentiality of your account names, passwords, and user IDs and keep track of who is using your Friend.ly account or third-party accounts, as applicable.  If you suspect any unauthorized use of your accounts, or if you believe your account names, passwords, or user IDs have been compromised, immediately notify us or, if applicable, the third party (see contact information in Section 18, below).
8.     ** OPTING OUT**
If you do not wish to receive promotional e-mail from us about our products and services, you may opt out at the time of registration or information collection.  If you wish to change your contact preferences at a later date, you may login to your account settings online and update your contact preferences.  You have the ability to choose, through your account settings, whether or not to allow other users to contact you through private messaging or e-mail.  Please note, even if you opt out of receiving promotional e-mail from us, you may still receive operational e-mails, including messages relating to transactions or Services you have specifically requested, responding to any e-mail from you to us, notifying you of updates or changes to our policies and procedures, or that otherwise provide you with information we believe is important to users of the Site, Software, or Services.  Our systems require time to update, so your opt out requests may not update immediately.
