FrozenCPU.com knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust.
FrozenCPU.com takes every precaution to protect our users’ information.
FrozenCPU.com incorporates the latest technology for securing your user information in transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol. SSL encrypts all the information you input and send to us.
The Commodo SSL certificate on every page of FrozenCPU.com web site verifies that you are in fact sending your information to us and not another web site.
FrozenCPU.com does not reveal any credit card information and your credit card information is not stored after submission to our payment gateway provider.
When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line. Our order system has numerous checks and balances designed to stop and prevent fraudulent orders from passing through so we ask customers ordering through our website to please make sure to have your credit card has both your shipping and billing addresses listed on file!
We here at FrozenCPU.com understand that shipping and billing is NOT always possible or convenient but if such arrangements need to be made, we will need the toll-free number to card holder’s services on the back of your credit card to verify billing address as well as your full name. The last four digits of your social security number for security purposes as well.
Thus this new procedure now exists making it safer and easier to order from us anywhere in the world. Please read our Shipping Policies Domestic and International. We take fraud very seriously and we will prosecute to the fullest extent of the law. We have caught fraudulent credit cards before and we will continue to catch them as our system is designed to flag even the most remotely suspicious orders.
We strongly suggest you do NOT try to fraud us as Internet/Mail Order fraud and credit card theft may seem simple but are very serious crimes.
All of our users’ information is classified and restricted.
FrozenCPU.com’s warehouse is a secured and locked facility. Security cameras are stationed throughout the building in conjunction with several alarm systems. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information.
In addition, our employees are required to lock their respective workstations when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to your information.
All employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.
Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what
they can do to ensure our customers’ information is protected.
If you have any questions about the security at our website, please contact us through our Contact Us page.
