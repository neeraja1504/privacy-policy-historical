Information Obtained from Third Parties
We may obtain credit information about you from an outside credit reporting agency to help us with customer authentication and credit-related decisions, such as eligibility for discounts or contract length. When possible, we use a soft inquiry to determine qualification, but may also inquire using a 'hard pull' to determine eligibility.
If you provide us personal information about others, or if others give us your information, we will only use that information for the specific reason for which it was provided to us.

We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy. We do not sell your personal information to third parties.
We may provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities such as shipping your order or offering customer service. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.
We may provide your personal information to companies that provide a co-branded or joint marketing program in which you have opted to participate. For instance, we may run a special promotion with a third party home insurance provider who is offering incentives for you to purchase one of our home security monitoring systems. We may share your personal information with such partners to enable them to administer the incentive program. In those instances, their use of your personal information will be subject to their own privacy policies.
