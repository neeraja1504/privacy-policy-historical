Data we collect and store
We don’t collect personal data by default on any of the Frosmo sites. The server logs related to the sites may contain pseudonymous personal data that could be used to identify a person when combined with other data. However, the log data is only ever used for technical monitoring, not profiling or any commercial purposes.
For more information about data storage and retention, see Data collection and storage.
Frosmo website
On the Frosmo website, we do not collect any personal data by default. Any data we collect through the Frosmo Platform is stored in SQL databases hosted by trusted partners and controlled by Frosmo.
If you give us your email address to subscribe to the Frosmo newsletter, we store the address in our marketing automation system and only use the address to send you occasional newsletters. We may also monitor the performance of the newsletter, for example, how many recipients have opened it.  If you no longer wish to receive newsletters, you can opt out by unsubscribing to the newsletter through a link in it.
If you contact us through our website, we will use your information only in connection with the contact request and will not share it with a third party. We may later ask to retain your information for marketing or other commercial purposes. If we have no contact with you within two years, we will archive your information and remove it according to our normal data retention cycle.
If you register to an event, we store your contact information in our CRM and may use it for marketing communications. You can refuse these communications at any time.
If you apply for a job at Frosmo through our website, we store your contact information and any attachments you send, such as your CV, cover letter, or portfolio, in our content management system. We use your information only in connection with the recruitment process and will not share it with third parties other than those possibly involved in the process.  We will keep your information for up to two years, so that should any future position open up that matches your background, we can get in touch with you.
Frosmo Documentation
On Frosmo Documentation, we do not collect personal data.
Frosmo Control Panel
In the Frosmo Control Panel, we do not collect personal data from non-registered users.
For registered users of the Control Panel, we store the necessary account information. This account data contains:
Name
Email address
Company or companies to which the user has access
Activity log for monitoring and debugging purposes
The account data is stored in an SQL database controlled by Frosmo and removed manually when the subscription agreement with the customer ends.
Cookies and third-party services
The Frosmo websites and user interfaces use cookies to identify a visitor (based on the device and browser they are using) across domains and sites. For a list of cookies set by the Frosmo Platform, see Cookies in Data collection and storage.
Analytics services
The Frosmo sites and user interfaces may run the following analytics tools:
Google Analytics
Hotjar
Matomo (formerly Piwik)
We use the analytics data to compile aggregated statistics about the performance of our sites and user interfaces. We may trace individual user paths with Hotjar to gather information about Control Panel usage. The analytics data is not used for profiling or to identify a person.
Other third-party services
Frosmo uses the following services for marketing communications and to maintain customer and stakeholder information:
HubSpot: Marketing automation and event registration on the Frosmo website
MailChimp: Marketing automation
Membrain: Customer relationship management
WordPress: Content management for the Frosmo website
Contact information stored in these systems is retained for up to two years, after which it is archived or removed, unless you become our customer, or otherwise continue to communicate with us.
Transfer of data
For the users of the Frosmo sites and user interfaces who are located within the EU/ETA area, Frosmo does not transfer personal data outside the EU/ETA area. However, analytics services and other third-party services used by Frosmo may process personal data on servers located outside the EU/ETA area (namely, in the US).
When a content delivery network (CDN) is used to deliver the Frosmo JavaScript library to a user’s browser, in some cases there is a chance that the CDN server used is located outside the EU/ETA area. However, the Frosmo JavaScript library as such does not contain personal data.
Data security
Frosmo is committed to protecting the security of the visitors’ personal data and has a variety of security technologies and procedures in place to prevent unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of data.
For example, our operational tools can only be accessed over HTTPS. Access to the tools is always protected with credentials. All operational networks are protected by firewalls and managed by designated employees.
For more information about data, application, and operational security at Frosmo, see Security overview.
Rights of the data subject
As a data subject, you have the right to access and evaluate any personal data about yourself. You have the right to demand rectification or restriction of the processing of your personal data in case there is a legal basis for you to do so.
