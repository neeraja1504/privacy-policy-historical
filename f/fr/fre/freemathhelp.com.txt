Freemathhelp.com collects no personal information from you without your consent. If you sign up for the newsletter your email address is stored in the mail system, but certainly will never be given out to anybody else, sold, or misused. There is no way to associate this email address to any particular person, since your no other information is collected at sign up.
The contact form is an area where personally identifiable information could be given out, but none is required. You will have to supply an email address if you would like a response, but again, this email cannot be connected with you unless you include more information on your own.
If you have any questions, feel free to ask me. If you are under 13, you should ask your parents before contacting anyone, including this website, over the internet. We do reserve the right to change this policy, but it's not like I'm going to start selling your emails. I hate spam too! Submittal of any information constitutes your acceptance of this privacy policy. Thanks again for visiting freemathhelp.com!
