FreeTaxUSAÂ® Privacy Policy Regarding Free Tax Preparation and E-file
Information Collection and Use
TaxHawk, Inc. is the sole owner of the information collected on www.FreeTaxUSA.com. Information is collected in order for taxpayers to prepare and electronically file their tax returns. Tax return information is only disclosed to appropriate government and financial institutions in order to file tax returns and comply with Internal Revenue Service requirements. The data collected includes everything that is needed to prepare a tax return, such as names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, mailing address, email address, and any tax-related information (e.g. W-2s and 1099 forms). If a purchase is made, credit card information for a credit card payment or bank account information for an e-check payment will be gathered. Information may also be collected from customers who contact us for support. The information collected, such as a phone number, will be used to research and resolve customer questions. As part of an effort to enhance protection of your identity and your personal information, we may match personal information you provide against publicly available information provided by other sources such as a service that provides identity verification.
Due to European Union (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA) regulatory requirements, we do not provide service or intentionally collect data from EU or EEA residents. By using our service, customers represent that they are not EU or EEA residents.

We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. FreeTaxUSA.com stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact us at webmaster@FreeTaxUSA.com to request that we remove this information from our database.
Data Retention Policy
Active Account Data Retention Policy: An active account is defined as an account that has started a tax return in the last 5 years. Tax return data (including tax return PDF and partial data) will be retained for a maximum of 7 years in active accounts. Data will be deleted on Oct 31st of the 7th year from the original IRS tax due date of the given tax year. For example, if a 2017 tax return is filed before October 31, 2018 the data will be maintained until October 31, 2025 if the account remains active through that period of time. If a return is filed after October 31st of the year it is due, it is considered a prior year return and the same active account policy applies. For example, if a 2015 return, which was due in 2016, exists in a currently active account and is filed in 2020, it will be maintained until October 31, 2023 (7 years after the original IRS tax filing deadline). However, prior year returns will be maintained a minimum of 3 years even if the 7 year retention period has elapsed.
Inactive Account Data Retention Policy: An inactive account is defined as an account that has not started a tax return in the last 5 years. Tax return data (including tax return PDF and partial data) will be retained for a maximum of 5 years in an inactive accounts. Data will be deleted on Oct 31st of the 5th year from the original IRS tax due date of the given tax year. For example, if a 2017 tax return is filed before October 31, 2018 the data will be maintained until October 31, 2023 if the account is inactive through that period of time. If a return is filed after October 31st of the year it is due, it is considered a prior year return. If the account is inactive after filing a prior year return the inactive account policy applies. For example in an inactive account, if a 2014 return with an original due date in 2015 is filed in 2016 it will be maintained until October 31, 2020 (5 years after the original IRS tax filing deadline). However, prior year returns will be maintained a minimum of 3 years even if the 5 year retention period has elapsed.

Security
FreeTaxUSA.com maintains physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with applicable law and federal standards.

Access to your personally identifiable information is protected by a password, of your choosing, in order to maintain security for your account. Only you, or someone with whom you share your password, can access your account to make changes to your return or account information.
Along with using SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also take great care to protect user information offline. The FreeTaxUSA.com servers are located in a secure data storage facility with strict security measures and procedures in place. All user information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted to only key employees who need the information to perform a specific job function (Example: the customer service manager). Furthermore, all employees are kept up-to-date on the security and privacy practices of FreeTaxUSA.com. Before every tax season, as well as any time new policies are added, employees of FreeTaxUSA.com are notified and/or reminded about the importance placed on privacy, and what they can do to ensure the security of user information. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.
