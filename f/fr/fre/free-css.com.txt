Server Logs
Our hosting provider collects website access data and saves the data in "server log files", the following (known) data is written to the log files:
IP address
Browser type
Operating system
Server access on/when
Amount of data sent
Referrer URL
Computer host name
The data is used for statistical purposes only, but, Free CSS reserves the right in retrospective effect to check server log files should evidence be available that indicates illegal / unlawful use of the Free CSS website.
Our provider stores Log Files for a maximum of 9 weeks, after this time the files are permanently deleted from the server.
IP addresses that are in the log files are anonymised by our provider after a period of 7 days, this is to our knowledge, automated. The anonymisation ensures the process of identifying a natural person via the IP address is not possible.
Social Media Links
We have multiple links in our website to a variety of social media platforms. These links are ther for the end-user to use to add pages they like to their social media platform of choice.
All of the links are controlled by us and none of them send personal data when clicked. The social media platforms that we link to probably use user tracking, which will let them know where you have come from after landing on their website, the data that is collected by the social media platform has nothing to do with us and we can not prevent it.
