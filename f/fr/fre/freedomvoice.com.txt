Information Collection, Use, and Sharing
We are the sole owners of the information collected on this website or through the app. We only have access to/collect personally identifiable information that you voluntarily give us. We will not sell or rent this information to anyone. We will use your information to respond to you, regarding the reason you contacted us. We will not share your information with any third party outside of our organization, other than as necessary to fulfill your request or in response to a lawful request by law enforcement.
Unless you ask us not to, we may contact you via email in the future to tell you about promotions, new products or services, or changes to this privacy policy.
Encryption & Security
We take great precaution to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website or the FreedomVoice mobile application, your information is protected both online and offline.
Wherever we collect sensitive information, such as credit card data, that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. This applies to information collected on FreedomVoice.com and information collected through the FreedomVoice mobile application.  You can verify this on FreedomVoice.com by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web browser, or looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the web page.  For the FreedomVoice mobile application, although it is not possible to confirm it visually, information is only transmitted using HTTPS.
While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.
