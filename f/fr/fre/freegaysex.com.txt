Anonymous Info
Our Cookies
Your browser offers so-called “cookies”, which – if you allow their use – store small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to any of our sites.  Cookies assist us in tracking which of our features you like best.  And when you re-visit our sties, cookies can enable us to customize our content according to your preferences.  However, cookies tell us nothing about you personally unless you specifically give us additional information.
We may use cookies to:
Keep count of your return visits to our site or our clients' sites.
Accumulate and report anonymous, aggregate, statistical information on Web site usage.
Deliver content specific to your interests.
Save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our sites.
We do not use cookies to identify, monitor or track any personally identifiable information.  Our cookies in and of themselves do not contain any personally identifiable information about you.  We do not merge or associate our cookie information with any personally identifiable information obtained by us or from third parties.
You also have choices with respect to cookies.  By modifying your browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies.    However, note that if you reject some or all cookies, your experience at our sites and on other sites throughout the World Wide Web may not be complete.   Some sites require cookies to function, such as those with e-commerce features.  In addition, if you do not allow cookies, you will not be able to take advantage of personalized content delivery offered by us or other Internet sites.
Third Party Cookies At Our Site
Some of the banner ads displayed on our sites are provide by outside companies.  These ads may contain cookies.  The use of advertising cookies sent by third party servers is standard in the Internet industry.   While we use cookies in other parts of our Web site, cookies received with banner ads are placed by our advertisers.   We do not have access to these cookies or any information that they may contain; please contact the advertisers for more information on these cookies
IP Addresses
An IP address is a number assigned to your computer whenever you surf the Web.  IP addresses are not personally identifiable information and we have never had the ability to determine your IP address.  Internet Service Providers (ISPs) usually randomly assign IP addresses at the time of dial-up.   For other local area network (LAN) or cable modem users, the ISP or network may permanently assign a specific IP address to a particular computer or other device connected to that network.   Anytime you connect to a site on the Internet, the computers communicating with each other exchange IP addresses.  IP addresses can reveal things like what part of the world you're connecting from, or which Internet Service Provider you are using, but they do not reveal who you are.
Web Beacons
Our Web pages and the Web pages of our counter customers or members of our affiliate program contain electronic images (called a “single-pixel gif” or “Web beacon”) that allow us to count page views or to access our counter cookies.  In general, any electronic image viewed as part of a Web page, including an ad banner, can act as a Web beacon.  Web beacons are typically very small, banner like files, but their presence can be easily seen within Internet Explorer by clicking on “View” and then on “Source”.   Web beacons are so small in order not to use valuable space on the computer screen that is better used to display helpful content.  We also include Web beacons in HTML- formatted newsletters containing graphics that we send to opt-in subscribers in order to count how many newsletters have been read.   In addition, some advertising networks that serve ads on our Web sites may use Web beacons within in their clearly visible banner advertisements.  Our Web beacons do not collect, gather, monitor or share any personal information about our Web site visitors, they are just the technique we use to compile our anonymous, aggregated statistics about Web site usage.
Computer Profiles
Through our technology, we also collect and accumulate other anonymous data that helps us understand and analyze the Internet experience of our visitors.  For example, we accumulate visitor data relating to referring domains, the type of browsers used, operating system software (e.g. Windows 95 vs. 98), screen resolutions, color capabilities, plug-ins, language settings, cookie preferences, search engine keywords and JavaScript enablement.  We also record number of visits, paths, taken and time spent on sites and pages.  None of this information is personally identifiable and we only share this information in the aggregate, reflecting overall Web site or Internet usage trends.
Security
Our sites have physical, electronic and managerial security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.  We take many measures to protect this information while it is stored, including:
We use Secure Socket layer (SSL) connections with 128- bit encryption for certain transactions and confidential data.  When you use a secure browser, all information you submit to us is transmitted to us over the Internet in an encrypted form.
We monitor system and application activity logs to identify any unusual activity, from authorized and/or unauthorized individuals accessing our systems and/or making changes to stored information, for investigation.   We regularly perform preventative system maintenance and monitoring to ensure the security of our data systems.
Our servers are maintained in secured access, locked facilities.  NOC attendants monitors our data center 24 hours per day, seven days per week.   Backup tapes are retrieved daily and stored.  All our employees sign confidentiality agreements and only our employees who need information to perform their job and who have passed background checks are granted access to personally identifiable information or any other confidential data.
You do not need to set up a user ID and password to use our Web sites because we do not require you to establish your identity when you visit our sites. However, if you have subscribed to some of our services you will have to provide passwords.  We recommend you do not divulge your password to anyone.  FGS will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited telephone call or e-mail.  You are responsible for the secrecy of your passwords.
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.   As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit, and you do so at your own risk.  Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.  You can report network abuse and any risk of security violations to us by e-mail at the above address.
Children
Because we care about the safety and privacy of children online, we comply with the Children's Online Privacy Act of 1998 (COPA).   COPA and its accompanying FTC regulation established United States federal law that protects the privacy of children using the Internet.  FGS does not knowingly collect contact or personal information from children under 13.   Our sites are not intended to solicit information of any kind from children under 13, and we have designed our sites to block our knowing acceptance of information from children under 13 wherever age related information is requested.
It is possible that by fraud or deception we may receive information given to us or pertaining to children under 13.   If we are notified of this, as soon as we verify the information, we will immediately obtain parental consent or otherwise delete the information from our servers.   If you want to notify us of our receipt of information by children under 13, please do so by e-mailing us.
E-mails
We do not ordinarily maintain e-mails that have been sent to us after they have been replied to, but if you would like to review, edit or delete any information previously e-mailed to us that we might still have, send an e-mail to us at the above address.    It's important that you include a copy of the previous e-mail, including its original address line, to enable us to locate it.
