Cookies
Like most websites, this one uses cookies. We use them to personalise content and ads, to provide social media features and to analyse our traffic. We also share information about your use of our site with our social media, advertising and analytics partners.
By continuing to use our website, you agree to accept cookies from us - our website will not operate properly without them.
The cookies we set broadly fall into these types:
Personalisation cookies
These cookies enable you to log in to our website, and be "remembered" by us, which in turn enables you to use features such as your download history, the images saved in your lightboxes,Â  the contents of your shopping cart, and your currency preferences.
Because these cookies are essential to the correct operation of our website, we will always try and set them on your computer. You can prevent us from setting cookies by adjusting the privacy settings within your web browser, but bear in mind our website will not work properly if you do. Changing privacy settings in this way will then apply to all websites you visit, not just this one.
