Your privacy is important to us!
General information
When you visit the Axandra site, we collect some basic information that does not identify individual users. This includes which pages are visited, types of products purchased, and any feedback from our visitors. We then collate this information with other pieces of information to improve our site and make your experience on the site as valuable and efficient as possible.
On some pages, you can order products, make requests, and register to receive unlock codes. The types of personal information collected on these pages are:
First and last name
Billing address
Shipping address(es)
Email address
Phone number
Credit card account number
Titles of items you purchase from us
We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order only to complete that order, to send you our announcement newsletter (we’ll inform you when updates are available) and to use it internally for statistical reasons. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.
We use return email addresses to answer the emails we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.
Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above, without also providing you with an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.
We use Google Analytics on our web pages. You can opt-out of Google Analytics with a browser plugin. IP addresses will be anonymized.
Credit card processing and security
Shopping with Axandra GmbH is absolutely safe – you never have to worry about credit card safety when you shop at our site. We guarantee that each purchase you make is protected and safe. If fraudulent charges are ever made, you will not have to pay them.
Axandra GmbH uses the services of SWREG.org to provide the highest level of secure online transactions. Your credit card information cannot be read as it travels to our ordering system. SWREG.org maintains their own privacy and security policies. If you have questions about these services, or how they handle the information they receive, please contact SWREG.
All information you enter in the SWREG.org order form will be shared with Axandra GmbH in order to send you the unlock code for the software. This does not apply to your credit card information. We never get your credit card number. SWREG will send you a single additional email message one week after your purchase.
You can access all your personally identifiable information, that we collect online and maintain, by sending us an email with your name and the unlock code for the Axandra product you purchased. The exception, as explained above or in the "Credit Card Processing and Security" section, is your credit information, since it is not kept.
You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by sending us a request that credibly shows error.
Our commitment to data security
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
