Privacy Policy (01/01/2011)
At freePRnow we recognize that privacy is important. This Policy applies to all of the products, services and websites offered by freePRnow LLC ("freePRnow") or its subsidiaries or affiliated companies (collectively, freePRnow's "services").
The freePRnow website allows its members to submit personal information. Other members, when looking at your profile, can view some of the information in your profile (e.g. name, company, and tags). This is information about yourself that you are asked to submit or be candid about. Other, more personal, information will only be accessible to others if you choose to submit and make it publicly visible to others. This information includes but is not limited to your email address and phone number. We will not collect or use sensitive information for purposes other than those described in this Policy and/or in the specific service notices, unless we have obtained your prior consent.
Some of our advertising partners, including Google AdSense, may use cookies, JavaScript, or web beacons on our site to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and/or to personalize the advertising content that you see. freePRnow has no access to or control over these cookies that are used by third-party advertisers.
When you send email or other communication to or through freePRnow, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services.
freePRnow may present links in a format that enables us to keep track of whether these links have been followed. This information is only used to improve the quality of our service.
freePRnow retains the right to share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information, such as the number of users who searched for a particular term, for example, or how many users clicked on a particular advertisement. Such information does not identify you individually.
Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Policy without your explicit consent, and we expect most such changes will be minor. Regardless, we will post any Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of Policy changes). Each version of this Policy will be identified at the top of the page by its effective date.
