Privacy policy of Freshsofts.com covers the collection and use of personal information that may be collected by Freshsofts.com anytime you interact with us such as when you make a purchase, contact a technical support or sales associate, sign up for an e-newsletter or request a download of demonstration software.
We collect your personal information because it assists us in delivering a high level of customer service. For example, your personal information helps us to keep you informed and up-to-date on the latest product updates and announcements as well as special offers that may be extended from time to time.
