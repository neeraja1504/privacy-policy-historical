Updates. This Privacy Policy will be periodically updated to reflect changes in laws, regulations, and their interpretation, and, therefore, we reserve the right to change, modify or amend this Privacy Policy at any time.

Dispute Resolution. You and FreeSportsBet.com agree that any Dispute between you and FreeSportsBet.com shall be resolved exclusively and finally by arbitration administered by the National Arbitration Forum ("NAF"), using interpretations under Colorado law, and conducted under its rules, except as otherwise provided below. You and FreeSportsBet.com will agree on another arbitration forum if NAF ceases operations. The arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator, and will be limited solely to the Dispute between you and FreeSportsBet.com. The arbitration, or any portion of it, will not be consolidated with any other arbitration and will not be conducted on a class-wide or class action basis. The arbitration shall be held at any reasonable location in Denver, Colorado. If you prevail in the arbitration of any Dispute with FreeSportsBet.com, FreeSportsBet.com will reimburse you for any fees you paid to NAF in connection with the arbitration. Any decision rendered in such arbitration proceedings will be final and binding on the parties, and judgment may be entered thereon in any court of competent jurisdiction. Should either party bring a Dispute in a forum other than NAF, the arbitrator may award the other party its reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred in staying or dismissing such other proceedings or in otherwise enforcing compliance with this dispute resolution provision. You understand that, in the absence of this provision, you would have had a right to litigate disputes through a court, including the right to litigate claims on a class-wide or class action basis, and that you have expressly and knowingly waived those rights and agreed to resolve any Disputes through binding arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph. This arbitration provision shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Section 1, et seq. For the purposes of this provision, the term "Dispute" means any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to: (i) this Privacy Policy, its interpretation, or the breach, termination, applicability or validity thereof; (ii) the related order for, purchase, delivery, receipt or use of any product or service from FreeSportsBet.com; or iii) any other dispute arising out of or relating to the relationship between you and FreeSportsBet.com; the term "FreeSportsBet.com" means FreeSportsBet.com, its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, directors, officers, employees, beneficiaries, agents, assigns, component suppliers (both hardware and software), and/or any third party who provides products or services purchased from or distributed by FreeSportsBet.com.
