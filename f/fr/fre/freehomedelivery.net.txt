Demographic and profile data may be collected at our site. We use this data to tailor your experience at freehomedelivery.net, showing content that we think you might be interested in, and displaying the content according to your preferences. We do this in two ways. First, we analyze member’s information in aggregate – that is, we collect information about thousands of site visits and analyze it as a whole. This kind of study involves looking for trends among many visitors to freehomedelivery.net, rather than analyzing information about any individual member. Examples include researching which parts of the site are accessed most frequently, or determining which products are most attractive to our users. Second, we may use information gathered during your visit to help customize our communications with you.
freehomedelivery.net may periodically conduct individual voluntary member surveys. We encourage our members to participate in these surveys because they provide us with important information that helps us to improve the types of services we offer, and how we provide them to you. The responses we collect in online surveys are anonymous. In the end, we hope to tailor our communications with you to fit your needs – so that you receive more of what you want from us and less of what you don’t want.
