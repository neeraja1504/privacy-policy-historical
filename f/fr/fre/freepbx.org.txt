Commitment to Privacy
Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.
Information Collected
The types of personal information we collect include all the information entered on the site registration and store pages: shipping and billing name and address, email address, phone number and credit card information. In addition, we also save webserver logs which tell us your IP address and unique FreePBX installation ID. We gather this information for the purpose of estimating the size of our user base and other marketing purposes. We will, from time-to-time, set up surveys to learn more about what FreePBX users want and how the product is used.
Uses of Information
We use the information you provide when placing an order to complete that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order or to provide services where the outside party is acting on our behalf and has no independent right to use the information we provide (i.e. a third party shipping or customer support center).
We use aggregate information to better design our website and to share with potential business partners. For example, we may tell a potential partner that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of people from a certain zip code purchased certain items, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.
In the process of fulfilling your order, we may contact you regarding your order status or to clarify information you have provided.
We may also contact you from time to time about products or specials that we think you may be interested in. If you do not wish to receive these notifications, we will honor your request not to send them to you.
We use return email addresses from your email correspondence to us to answer the email we receive. Such addresses from your correspondence are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.
Finally, we do not use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without providing you an opportunity to tell us not to allow such unrelated uses.
Children’s Privacy
Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we do not collect or maintain information from our online store from those we actually know are under the age of 13.
Data Security
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
PayPal uses secure servers to protect all of your personal information including your name, address and credit card information.
As a merchant who accepts PayPal, our PayPal-enabled checkout process uses industry-standard SSL encryption to ensure the privacy and security of your information. (Please remember that no data transmission over the Internet, or by other means, can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.)
Acess and Data Correction
You can access and correct your order and contact information by contacting us. You can also access your order history on the FreePBX.org website.
