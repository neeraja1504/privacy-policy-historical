How do we use cookies and other technical information?
Cookies and Web beacons. Third-party service providers, our business partners, our affiliates, and we may send “cookies” to your computer (or mobile device) or use similar technologies to enhance your online experience at our Website. “Cookies” are a string of information that a website stores on a user’s computer (or mobile device), and that the user’s browser provides to the website each time the user submits a query to the website. Cookies can identify you as a unique customer and store your personal preferences as well as technical information. Cookies manage and measure the performance of advertisements displayed on or delivered by or through us or other networks or websites. Cookies can either be persistent (that is, they remain on your computer until you delete them) or temporary (that is, they last only until you close your browser). Cookies on our Website do not link to or store your personal information.
For example, when you sign in to our Website, we will record your user or member ID and the name associated with your user or member ID in the cookie file on your computer. We also may record your password in this cookie file, if you told us that you would like your password saved for automatic sign-in. For security purposes, we encrypt account-related data that we store in these cookies. For websites and services that do not use a user or member ID, the cookie will contain a unique identifier. We may use persistent tracking cookies on your mobile device, mainly for security protection purposes, such as to prevent phishers, scammers, unauthorized log in attempts, and to help you access your hacked account. We may allow our service providers to serve cookies from our Website or application to allow them to assist us in various activities, such as doing analysis and research on the effectiveness of our Website, content, and advertising.
Our Website may use locally stored objects (sometimes referred to as “Flash cookies”) to provide certain content, such as video on demand, video clips, or animation. The Adobe Flash Player and similar applications use this technology to remember settings, preferences, and usage similar to browser cookies. Flash cookies are not managed through your browser, but you can access your Flash management tools from Adobe’s website.
We may also use “Web beacons” that monitor your use of our Website. “Web beacons” (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags, or Web bugs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of users or to access cookies. Unlike cookies, which are stored on the user’s device, Web beacons are embedded invisibly on the webpages (or in email) and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We use Web beacons to collect the following information: (1) the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the computer that downloaded the webpage on which the Web beacon appears; (2) the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) of the webpage on which the Web beacon appears; (3) the time the webpage containing the Web beacon was viewed; (4) the types of browser that fetched the Web beacon; and (5) the identification number of any cookie on the computer previously placed by that server.
When corresponding with you through HTML capable email, Web beacons let us know whether you received and opened our email.
On their own, cookies or Web beacons do not contain or reveal any personal information. But if you choose to furnish personal information, this information can be linked to the data stored in the cookies/Web beacons.
** Managing cookies and Web beacons. By accepting this privacy policy, you agree to our use of cookies and Web beacons as described in this privacy policy. You may adjust your browser to reject cookies from us or from any other website. Additionally, by setting your browser to display HTML emails as text only, you may be able to prevent the use of some Web beacons. Please consult the “Help” section of your browser for more information. Please understand that you can only access certain areas of our Website in conjunction with cookies or similar devices and you should be aware that disabling cookies or similar devices might prevent you from accessing some of our content or Website features. You assume all responsibility for any resulting loss of functionality because of disabling cookies or similar devices.**
Do you have any choices about collection and use of your information? You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result in you being unable to use certain features of our Website because that information may be required in order for you to register as a member; purchase products or services; participate in a live interaction or promotion; ask a question; or initiate other transactions.
When you register on our Website, you consent to receive email messages from us. You may modify this consent later by visiting the “Account Settings” page associated with your account. You can always choose to no longer receive commercial or promotional emails from us by visiting the “Account Settings” page associated with your account. You also will have the opportunity, in any commercial email that we send to you, to opt-out of receiving any similar messages in the future. Online opt-out requests are instant; it may take up to postal procedure/time frame and 15 days for any offline by mail opt-out requests. However, we may send you transactional and relationship emails, such as service announcements and administrative notices, without offering you the opportunity to opt-out of receive them.
Our mobile applications may also deliver notices to your phone or mobile device. You can disable these notices in your device’s settings, in your account under “Account Settings,” or by deleting the relevant mobile application.
You can also control information collected by cookies. Please see our discussion of cookies above for information about declining or deleting cookies.
What is “Do Not Track” and does the Website follow it? Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that you can set in your Web browser. DNT is a way for you to inform websites and services that you do not want certain information about your webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information we collect and that is why we provide you the ability to opt-out. However, we do not recognize or respond to any DNT signals as the Internet industry works toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT.
How secure is your personal information? We take reasonable administrative, physical, and electronic measures designed to safeguard and protect your information from unauthorized access or disclosure. This includes using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts the personal information you input, and storing your information in encrypted form behind a firewall designed to block access from outside our network.
Although we use commercially reasonable efforts to safeguard the privacy of your information, transmissions on the Internet cannot be made absolutely secure. Moreover, we cannot assure you that your personal information that we collect will not be used or disclosed inconsistently with this privacy policy. We assume no responsibility or liability for disclosure of any of your information due to errors in transmission, unauthorized third-party access, or other causes beyond our reasonable control.
What about other websites linked to our Website? There are places on the Website where you can click on a link to access other websites. For example, if you click on an advertisement on our Website, you may be taken to a third-party website. These third-party websites may independently solicit and collect information, including personal information, from you and, in some instances, provide us with information about your activities on those websites. Third parties are under no obligation to comply with this privacy policy concerning personal information that you provide directly to those third parties or that those third parties collect for themselves. We neither own nor control third-party websites accessible through our Website. Thus, this privacy policy does not apply to information provided to or gathered by third parties that operate them. We assume no responsibility for the content or the privacy policies of any other websites that may provide links to our Website or to whom we may provide links, or for the privacy policies of any of their advertisers. Before visiting a third-party website, whether by means of a link on this Website or otherwise, and before providing any personal information to any third party, you should inform yourself of the privacy policies any practices (if any) of the third party responsible for that website, and should take those steps necessary to, in your discretion, protect your privacy.
What about information you provide about yourself while using our Website? We have designed the Website to make it easy for you to find, connect, and interact with other members of the Website by posting information about yourself. You can also use our electronic messaging system, which allows you to communicate with other users provided you are both subscribers. We recommend and encourage you (and all our members) to think carefully about the information they disclose about themselves. We also do not recommend that you put email addresses, URLs, instant messaging details, phone numbers, full names or addresses, credit card details, national identity numbers, drivers’ license details, and other sensitive information in your profile, which is open to abuse and misuse.
Please be careful about posting sensitive details about yourself on your profile such as your religious denomination and health details. While you may voluntarily provide this information to us when you create your profile, including your sexual preferences and ethnic background, there is no requirement to do so. Please remember that photographs or any video clips that you post on the Website may reveal these kinds of sensitive personal data. Where you do upload and choose to tell us sensitive information about yourself, you are explicitly consenting to our processing your information and making this public to other users.
When you post information about yourself or use the messaging service, the amount of personal information you share is at your own risk. In addition, these postings may appear on other websites or in searches on the subject matter of your posting. Whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable webpages, you make that information publicly available and others can collect and use that information. For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited email messages. If you post anything that is inconsistent with our terms, we reserve the right to terminate your account.
Bottom line: We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution for your personal information.
What information does the Website collect about children? You may only use the Website if you are aged 18 or over or the age of majority in the country in which reside if that happens to be greater than 18. That means we do not knowingly collect any information about children, minors, or anyone under the age of majority. Nor do we knowingly market to children, minors, or anyone under the age of 18. If you are less than 18-years old, we request that you do not submit information to us. If we become aware that a child, minor, or anyone under the age of 18 has registered with us and provided us with personal information, we will take steps to terminate that person’s registration and delete that person’s profile information from the Website. If we do delete a profile because you violated our no children rules, we may retain your email and IP address to ensure that you do not try to get around our rules by creating a new profile.

In addition, if certain information has already been provided to third parties as described in this privacy policy, retention of that information will be subject to those third parties’ policies.
Do third parties have any rights under this privacy policy? No. This privacy policy does not create rights enforceable by third parties or require disclosure of any personal information relating to users of the Website.
Can we change this privacy policy? We will amend this privacy policy on one or more occasions, as we believe necessary or convenient to operate our Website. When we post changes to this privacy policy, we will revise the “last updated” date at the top of this privacy policy. We will use all commercially reasonable efforts to provide you with advance notice of any change by posting notice of the amended privacy policy on this webpage at least 30 days before its effective date. We will keep prior versions of this privacy policy in an archive for your review. Unless we obtain your express consent, any revised privacy policy will apply only to information collected after its effective date, and not to information collected under any earlier privacy policies. We encourage you to frequently check this webpage for any changes to this privacy policy. If you do not agree to our amended privacy policy, you must cancel your membership before or after the amended privacy policy becomes effective as provided in the terms or otherwise stop using this Website. If we do not hear from you, we will assume, and you agree, that your continued access to our Website after the amended privacy policy’s effective date forms your acceptance of our amended privacy policy, and thus the amended privacy policy will govern your access to or use of the Website after the effective date.
What law and language govern this privacy policy? Republic of Cyprus law governs this privacy policy and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter (including noncontractual disputes or claims). If a discrepancy exists between this English language version of the privacy policy and any translated copies of the privacy policy, the English version will prevail.
