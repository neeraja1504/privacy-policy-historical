Freeola Privacy Policy
We have chosen to minimise the information that we hold about you, and to make that information available to you within your MyFreeola account, and to store it securely and to delete it readily, and to gain your consent for non-essential marketing emails. However, basic transaction information must be retained under tax legislation, and it is also essential that we retain sufficient information to contact you if necessary, and to properly identify you before discussing your account with you.
Freeola Limited sells a mix of services and products, which are often fully provided by us, but sometimes involve others. We therefore work to ensure that our suppliers are privacy compliant and we monitor their privacy policies and keep records of such monitoring.
Unlike many other companies, we are not involved with buying, selling, mining, harvesting, gathering or collating any information about you.
It is our policy to be Ultra Private and to keep you informed along the way, gaining your explicit consent where necessary, and protecting your personal information. Our full Privacy Policy is presented below.
Product-specific privacy information and your email alerts and notification preferences can be found at the point of purchase or in your MyFreeola account.
Our Privacy Policy

When you purchase any services or products from Freeola or Get Dotted; during the payment process we will securely pass you to a payment processing provider (such as SagePay or PayPal) before you submit credit or debit card information.

As part of the Domain Registration Agreement, registrants must provide accurate registrant information including the name (or company name), email address and postal address. We will then pass these details on to the relevant domain registry or registrar (who will pass this on to the registry). Not providing accurate details is a breach of the Domain Registration Agreement and can lead to termination of the Agreement (and subsequent loss of the domain). All information can be updated via your MyFreeola Account or by contacting Freeola (see Section 10).
Payments:
When you make a payment you are securely passed to a secure payment processing provider (such as PayPal or SagePay), who will take your information and authorise the payment.

Fraud-prevention checks:
All payments go through a fraud check. Information such as your IP address, billing address and email address are passed on to MaxMind's minFraud service, which will check things such as the distance between the IP address and billing address as well as checking that the email address provided is not considered high-risk. The transaction will then receive a score, which will deem whether it is likely to be fraudulent.
Security products:
Upon purchasing ESET security software, you will be sent an email to download the software; your name and some other basic contact details may be requested. GeoTrust, Comodo or RapidSSL supply our SSL Certificates. When you purchase an SSL secure certificate, your contact information will be passed to the certificate issuer via our supplier. The SSL certificate issuer may need to verify this contact information and request confirmation and verification of your details. The level of verification is dependent on the certificate type that you choose.
