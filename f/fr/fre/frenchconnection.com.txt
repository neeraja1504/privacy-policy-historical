We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your personal data in the following circumstances:

Legitimate Interest: this means the interest of our Company in conducting and managing our business. This is to enable us to give you the best service, product and security. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) as well as your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law).
Comply with a legal or regulatory obligation: this means processing your personal data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal or regulatory obligation that we are subject to.
Generally, we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your personal data other than in relation to sending direct marketing communications to you via email or text message.

When using third party providers, we only provide them with the information that they need in order to deliver the service, restrict them from using the data for any other purposes and require them to keep your information secure.
Where we share financial details, these will always be entered on a secured page and transferred using SSL, a cryptographic protocol designed to provide communication security over the Internet.
In the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, it may become necessary to disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer. Your information may also be transferred to another company in the event of sale of the whole or part of our business to a third party.

We send two types of emails: customer service emails which are required to maintain our website and services; and newsletters or other marketing communications which contain special offers, discounts and information that might be of interest to you.

You can change your marketing preferences at any time by updating your account online, following the unsubscribe link in our emails, or by emailing dataprivacy@frenchconnection.com.
The Right to Object:
In some instances, you may have the right to ask us to stop processing your data. However, please note that this right does not always apply, for example where we are processing your data because we have a legitimate interest in doing so (such as where we contact you to follow up on a complaint you have made). You are always able to raise an objection to our processing and we will do our best to comply with your request, where we are legally able to.
The Right to Erasure (The right to be forgotten):
Similarly, you have the right (in some instances) to request that we destroy all the data that we hold on you.
We maintain and follow a retention policy, meaning we only store your personal data for as long as is necessary for the purposes listed in the How We Use Your Data and the Lawful Basis section above. The longest we normally hold customer records (apart from marketing) is 7 years after our business relationship has come to an end unless we are required by law or regulation to keep the data for longer. We will, however, stop processing your data for marketing as soon as you unsubscribe.
Nonetheless, should you want us to remove our records of your data prior to the end of our defined retention period, please contact: dataprivacy@frenchconnection.com.

10. How can I access and update my information?
The accuracy of your information is important to us. We’re working on ways to make it easier for you to review and correct the information that we hold about you. In the meantime, if any information that we hold on you is inaccurate or out of date, please email us at: dataprivacy@frenchconnection.com so that we can correct this for you.

11. Keeping your information safe
When you provide us with your personal information, we take steps to ensure that it’s treated securely.
Any sensitive information (such as bank, credit or debit card details) will always be entered on a secured page and transferred using SSL, a cryptographic protocol designed to provide communication security over the Internet. A secured page will be indicated by the appearance of a lock icon on the web browser.
Non-sensitive details, such as your email address, are transmitted normally over the Internet, and this can never be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.
Where a password has been provided, or chosen by you, which enables you to access certain parts of our website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone.
We only store your personal data for as long as is necessary for the purposes listed in the How We Use Your Data and the Lawful Basis section above. We may have to keep some of your information (such as payments information) for longer where this is reasonably necessary or required by law or regulation, for instance, to prevent fraud or resolve disputes. The longest we normally hold customer records (apart from marketing) is 7 years after our business relationship has come to an end unless we are required by law or regulation to keep the data for longer. We will, however, stop processing your data for marketing as soon as you unsubscribe.

12. Keeping children safe
It is important to us that we protect the privacy of children, being those under the age of 18. If you are aged under 18‚ please get your parent/guardian's permission beforehand whenever you provide us with personal information.
If we learn that we have collected the personal information of a child, being those aged 13 or under, we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible.
If you believe that a child under your care has submitted personal information to us, please contact us at: dataprivacy@frenchconnection.com so that we can delete it.

13. Links to other websites
Our website may contain links to other websites run by third-party organisations. This privacy policy applies only to our website‚ so we encourage you to read the privacy statements which can be found on the other websites you visit. We cannot be responsible for the privacy policies and practices of other websites. This applies even if you access them using links from our website.
In addition, if you linked to our website from a third-party site, we cannot be responsible for the privacy policies and practices of the owners and operators of that third-party website. We recommend that you check the privacy policy of that third-party website.

14. Transferring your information outside of the European Union
We operate internationally. Generally, we store your data within the European Economic Area (“EEA”). However, we may need to transfer your personal information outside the EEA to a country which may not have equivalent protections for your data as your country of residence.
For example, this may happen if any of our servers are located in a country outside of the EU or where your data is processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers.
If we transfer your data outside of the EEA, we will take steps to ensure that your rights and freedoms in respect of the processing of your personal data are adequately and appropriately protected and comply with all legal requirements.
If you use our services while you are outside the EU, your information may be transferred outside the EU in order to provide you with those services.
By submitting your personal data to us, you are agreeing to this transfer, storing or processing.
