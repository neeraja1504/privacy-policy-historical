We will share randomized, aggregated demographic information about our users with third parties. This information cannot identify any individual person. Deluxe may also disclose your Personal Data to any other third party with your prior consent.

* Technical Infrastructure
* Marketing & Analytics
* Order processing/Fulfillment & Support
* Credit and payment Card Transactions
We only share Personal Data with third party service providers to the extent necessary to provide the requested services. These companies are prohibited from retaining, sharing, storing or using the Personal Data for any secondary purposes.

When Deluxe does share your Personal Data with third party service providers and/or subprocessors, Deluxe will:
1. transfer such data only for limited and specified purposes;
2. ascertain that the subprocessor is obligated to provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by these Principles;
3. take reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure that the subprocessor effectively processes the Personal Data transferred in a manner consistent with the organization’s obligations under these Principles;
4. require the subprocessor to notify Deluxe if it makes a determination that it can no longer meet its obligation to provide the same level of protection as is required by these Principles;
