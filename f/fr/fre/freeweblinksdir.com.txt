While your email address may or may not be used to solicit you, it is added to the website’s general solicitation database.
Visitor Email or Testimonials: If you are a visitor and send an email to the website, or if you communicate with the site by phone or mail, the website collects information about your communication and by communicating with the site you give your permission to collect, archive, retrieve, and otherwise use any information collected as the site sees fit.
