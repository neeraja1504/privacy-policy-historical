Effective Date: September 26, 2018
Kano Applications Inc. (“ KANO ”, “ we ” or “ us ”) is a British Columbia company. This Privacy Policy applies to KANO’s games, websites and services (collectively, the“ Services ”).
As an essential part of our business, we collect and manage information. In doing so, we observe Canadian privacy legislation and are committed to respecting and protecting our users’ privacy and rights.
This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, manage, use, store and share information of yours when you access and use the Services and your rights with respect to the collection, correction and/or deletion of that information.
Except as described in this Privacy Policy, we will not use or share your information with anyone. However, this Privacy Policy does not apply to information we collect by other means (including offline) or from other sources.
1. PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU
In this Privacy Policy, your personal information means information about you as an identifiable individual and includes things such as your name, telephone number, address, email address or other location data, identification number, online identifier or to one or more factors specific to your physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity (collectively, “ your personal information ”).

Although the Services may allow you to visit as a guest and remain anonymous, some Services may require you to provide us with your personal information. In these situations, if you choose not to provide us with all of your personal information that we request then you may not be able to access all content and features of the Services.
2. NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU
We may also collect other, non-personally identifiable information about you (such as statistical data) from you directly or from third parties (collectively, “ other information ”), including: - metrics and other types of statistical data, which could be derived from your use of the Services (e.g., how you interact with the Services);

- apps you have installed and enabled and how you use those apps.
Although your computer or mobile device may allow you to turn off the collection of some of this other information, if you do so then you may not be able to access all content and features of the Services.
3. COOKIES AND TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES
Cookies and other tracking technologies (such as beacons, tags, scripts and clear gifs) (collectively, “ Tracking Technologies ”) are files that are sent by a service through your browser to your computer or mobile device, if your browser is enabled to accept them, in order to store certain information on your computer or mobile device and communicate with a service while you are online.
We may use Tracking Technologies in analyzing trends, administering the Services, tracking your movements through the Services and gathering demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may also use Tracking Technologies to remember users’ settings and for authentication and analytics. Our partners, affiliates, analytics or third-party service providers may also use Tracking Technologies for the same or similar purposes. We may receive reports based on the use of these Tracking Technologies by such companies on an individual and aggregated basis.
You can control the use of Tracking Technologies at the individual browser level, as Internet browsers will allow you to erase them from your computer hard drive, block their acceptance or receive a warning before they are stored. You should refer to your browser instructions or “Help” screen to learn more about how to manage them
.You may still use the Services if you block Tracking Technologies, but some portions of the Services may not function properly.
4. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION
We use your personal information in a variety of ways in providing the Services and operating our business, including:
- Operations: operating, maintaining and providing all features of the Services, establishing and maintaining your account on the Services and protecting its security, responding to your comments and questions and providing user support (e.g., hosting and displaying information, providing updates or addressing technical issues) in order to fulfil our contractual obligations.
-  Communications: contacting you:
- for administrative purposes, such as customer service issues (e.g., providing customer support, resolving customer issues, informing you of changes to the Services, like outages, suspensions or other material changes); or
- if you have given your consent, for promotional or marketing purposes, such as serving you advertisements on the Services that are provided by us or by third parties we work with or, if you signed up for any KANO newsletter, contacting you for KANO news, promotional purposes or market research. You have the ability to opt out of receiving any promotional communications as described below in section 6. - Improvements: generating and analyzing information about our users so we can better understand them and how they use the Services, drawing rends and predictions based on this information and developing, improving or expanding the Services and users’ experience with the Services.
5. HOW WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION
Sharing internally at KANO:
In order to use your personal information for operations, communications or improvements as noted above, we may share your personal information with our parent companies, affiliates, subsidiaries or contractors.
Sharing with Third Parties:
We use third parties to provide services on our behalf (such as serving advertisements, fulfilling a purpose you requested of us (e.g., billing services), providing customer support and feedback, analyzing Services functionality and technical issues, sending useful notifications to user devices, tracking use of the Services and generating reports and data models that we use to improve the Services). We may share your personal information with these third parties and they may collect information from you (including your personal information) to perform these services.
These third party services may be embedded into the Services (such as through an API or SDK) or may take the form of Tracking Technologies, which enable these third parties to collect information on our behalf.
Information collected by third parties is governed by the applicable third party’s privacy policy, which may provide for broader information collection than what we collect. These third parties may use your personal information internally and disclose your information to others, and we strongly recommend that you read each third party privacy policy carefully before providing your personal information.

6. ADVERTISING
If you have given your consent, the Services may contain advertisements served by third parties. These advertisements may use various Tracking Technologies to collect your personal information (such as demographics, location and device information) in order to serve you appropriate advertisements and to recognize your computer or mobile device each time a third party serves you an advertisement. Based on this information, third parties may be able to resolve your identity across multiple devices (e.g., matching your IP address across multiple devices) in order to target advertisements to you based on your online behavior. This information is collected, used and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the applicable third party privacy policy, as described in section 5 above.
You may be able to opt-out of mobile behavioral advertising by accessing the settings on your computer or mobile device and selecting the appropriate advertisement tracking settings.

8. SERVICE COMMUNICATION FEATURES
Your personal information such as your username and profile picture on the Services may be visible to other users of the Services. We recommend you exercise discretion when selecting your username and profile picture and when using the Services.

We are not responsible for protecting any of your personal information that you may disclose to third parties through our Services (e.g., sending your telephone number to another user through the chat service).
