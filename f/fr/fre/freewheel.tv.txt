Use of our Services – SSP
Through our SSP Services, the following cookies are dropped onto our clients’ customers’ devices:
Cookie Name | Cookie Type | Notes
---|---|---
UID | Persistent. This cookie is always set. | This is a unique, anonymous browser-identifier that allows us to know that the browser has been seen before. The cookie is used in the provision of the Services and to help generate statistics to show how many people may have seen particular advertising. The cookie is valid for one month and may be deleted but will be re-issued when another advertisement is requested from the system.
SessionID | Session. This cookie is always set. | SessionID tells the system that the request is part of a single session by a user. Advertisers would prefer not to show too many of the same ads to the same user in a single session. This cookie helps prevent that. The cookie expires at the end of the session and should be removed by the browser. It may be deleted but will be re-issued when another advertisement is requested from the system and deletion may result in repeat showing of otherwise restricted advertisements.
OA*CAP and OA*BLOCK cookies | Persistent. These cookies are only set when required. | These types of cookies tell the system to limit the number of times a browser may see a particular advertisement. The cookies can be valid for different time periods, depending on the limits of individual advertising campaigns, but are generally valid for between 30 days and 1 year. The cookies are removed when the campaigns to which they are attached are completed. If the cookies are rejected or deleted then the limitations on seeing individual advertisements may not be applied correctly. If the cookies are deleted the limits are re-set and a browser may see more of the advertisements that intended by the advertiser.
Uid-bp- | Persistent. These cookies are always set. | We connect customers to other advertising systems (buying partners) who buy video advertising space. Many of our buying partners need to know their unique identifier for a browser before they place an advertisements. Generally, this prevents buyers from showing the same video too many times to a single user across multiple websites. In order to match a buyer’s identifier to our system a synchronization process will set a cookie (beginning uid-bp-) which contains a user/browser identifier from the buying partner. This identifier can then be used in the advertising process. The cookies are valid for 1 year. These cookies may be deleted but will be re-set when the buyer is encountered again. The cookie contains an identifier set by the buyer’s system. Details of the cookies from our buying partners can be found on their websites. This data may be used by buying partners to target advertisements. We have no access to this data.
Dp- | Persistent. This cookie is only set when a marketplace has activated a third-party data service. | If our publisher partner uses an external provider of data (also known as a Data Management Platform, DMP) they may provide some of the data to our system to help when selling of advertisements. Our customers can set their own expiration period for this cookie from 30 days to 1 year. It may be deleted but will be re-issued when a request is made to our system. The data contained is controlled by the marketplace & data management platform who will be able to provide more details about the type of data referenced. This data is used to target advertisements.
