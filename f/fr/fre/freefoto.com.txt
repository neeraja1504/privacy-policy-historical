Data Collection and Opt Out
FreeFoto.com, as well as most sites on the Internet, use "cookies" to enhance your experience on the web. FreeFoto.com cannot use these cookies to personally identify you in any way. What are cookies and why do we use them? A cookie is a unique number that is provided to you the first time FreeFoto.com serves you a page. This unique number, which is stored in a cookie file on your computer, helps FreeFoto.com and help our advertisers understand what you like and don't like about their offerings so that they can cater better to your needs the next time you are interested in their products or services. While we believe that cookies enhance your Internet experience by limiting the number of times you see the same ad and delivering more relevant content to you, they are not required for FreeFoto.com to deliver you a page.
