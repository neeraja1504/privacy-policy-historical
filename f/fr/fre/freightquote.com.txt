Policy Effective Date
This policy is effective as of January 23, 2019 and replaces any and all previous versions.
Scope and Application of Policy
Freightquote.com, Inc. and its parent company for and on behalf of its subsidiaries (collectively “Freightquote”) created this policy (the “Privacy Policy”) in order to demonstrate our commitment to privacy. The policy describes collection, use, storage, sharing and protection of your personal information for the Freightquote.com website and all related sites, applications, services and tools where this policy is referenced, regardless of how you access or use them, including mobile devices.
Consent
By using the Freightquote.com website and its related sites, products, applications, services and tools, or registering for an account with Freightquote, you expressly consent to the collection, use, disclosure and retention of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. Further, you acknowledge, consent and agree that we may access, preserve, and disclose your registration and any other information you provide if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary in our opinion to: (1) comply with legal process, including, but not limited to, civil and criminal subpoenas, court orders, other compulsory disclosures, or at the advice of legal counsel; (2) respond to claims of a violation of the rights of third parties, whether or not the third party is a user, individual, or government agency; or (3) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Freightquote, our users or the public.
Throughout this Privacy Policy, we use the term “personal information” to describe information that can be associated with a specific person and could be used to identify that person. We do not consider personal information to include information that has been made anonymous or aggregated so that it can no longer be used, whether in combination with other information or otherwise, to identify a specific person.
