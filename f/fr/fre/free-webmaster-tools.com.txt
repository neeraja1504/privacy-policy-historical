Certain sections of this site log and display your IP number. IP numbers are not secret and have been used for years. Every site you visit logs and often displays your IP number.

If you use a Broadband connection to the Web such as Cable or DSL, you should install a firewall on your system to protect it from third party abuse. We have received good reports about ZoneAlarm, BlackICE, and the Linksys Router. Then check the integrity of your system using Shields UP.
