This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what information we collect, why we collect

browser version, pages of our Service that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time

4. Cookies, Pixel Tags, and Other Web Beacons
A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that we store on your browser or device if you
agree. Pixel tags and web beacons are tiny graphic images placed on website pages or in our
emails that allow us to determine whether you have performed specific actions. When you access
these pages or open email messages, the pixel tags and web beacons generate a notice of that
action to us or our service providers. These tools allow us to measure response to our
communications and improve our web pages and promotions.

We use the following types of cookies:
• Strictly necessary cookies. These are cookies that are required for the operation of our
Websites. They include, for example, cookies that enable you to log into secure areas of our
Websites.
•   Analytical/performance cookies. These cookies allow us to recognise and count the number
of visitors and to see how visitors move around our Websites. This helps us to improve the
way they work, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for
easily. We use these to remember who you are and keep track of your preferences, e.g. the
cities for which you want to be shown Partner offerings. We may also collect information
about the website you were visiting before you landed on one of our own, and the website
you visit after you leave our own, if this information is supplied to us by your browser.
•   Targeting and Remarketing Cookies from Third-party Advertising Networks. Fresha
has relationships with third party advertising companies to place advertisements on our
behalf onto other websites, and to perform tracking and reporting functions for our platform
and our advertisements. These third parties may place cookies on your device which
automatically collect information about your visit to one of our Websites, your IP address,
your ISP and the browser you use. Information collected may be used, among other things, to
deliver advertising targeted to your interests and to better understand the usage and visitation
patterns of our platform and Websites. You can learn more about this type of remarketing
below.
Remarketing Cookies
You may notice that sometimes, after visiting a website, you see increased numbers of adverts
from the site you visited. That’s because the website you visited has placed a cookie on your web
browser. Using that cookie and web analytics tools, the website owner will be able to show you
adverts on third-party websites that they think you might be interested in. This cookie does not
give access to your computer or mobile device, but may be able to identify you from other
details.
Google Analytics
Our Websites use Google Analytics to show relevant adverts to users who have previously
visited us as they browse the web. This enables us to tailor our marketing to better suit your
needs and only display ads that are relevant to you. You may see Fresha or one of our Partners in
search results pages (using Google Adwords), on YouTube, in banner adverts on Gmail and on
other services run by Google.
Any information collected will be used in accordance with our own privacy policy and Google’s
privacy policy. If you do not wish to see ads, you can:
• opt out of Google’s use of cookies through Google’s Ads Settings
Page 5! of 12
!
!
•    refuse the use of cookies by downloading and installing Google Analytics Opt-out Browser
Add-on.
Facebook Remarketing
We also use similar targeted advertising technology to ensure that we only serve people with
adverts on their Facebook pages that are relevant to them. To enable us to do this, we include a
piece of code on our websites, called the Facebook Pixel. The information collected, for example
which pages you visited, which device you used and what actions you took, will be used in
accordance with our own privacy policy, as well as Facebook’s privacy policies. The Facebook
Pixel only lasts for sixty (60) days. Using the Facebook Pixel, we can also remarket adverts to
you through Instagram, which is owned by Facebook. You can set preferences for how Facebook
advertises to you using your Facebook ad preferences.
Opting Out of Cookies
You can refuse to accept some or all cookies by modifying settings within your browser. For
guidance on how to do this, please visit http://www.aboutcookies.org. However, if you block
strictly necessary cookies, you may be unable to access certain parts of our Websites. If you wish
to opt out of remarketing cookies, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative Opt-out Page.
5. How We Use Your Personal Information
We will only use your personal information when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will
use your personal information in the following circumstances:
• where we need to perform a contract with you (e.g. to create an appointment or to process a
payment);
•    where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests
and fundamental rights do not override those interests (see the "Legitimate Interests" section
below); and
•    where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.
We may use personal information held about you in order to:
• provide you with offers for products and services from participating Partners, including
offers based on variables such as stated and anticipated customer interests, personal
characteristics, or location;
•    recommend certain Partners offerings to you (e.g., to suggest Partners to add to your
favourites page or remind you when it's time to rebook a service);
•    facilitate and fulfil requests for appointments for Partner offerings, including their purchase
and redemption;

•   improve our Services, including performing analysis, tracking your use of the Services for
the purposes of displaying advertising and content;

Your information will be treated in accordance with applicable data protection law.
6. Legitimate Interests
We may rely on legitimate interests to process your personal information, provided that your
interests do not override our own. Where we rely on legitimate interests, these interests are:
• providing, maintaining, and improving the Services to meet the needs of our End Users and
Partners;
•   understanding how the Services are used to improve their performance in the future;
•   customising the Services to provide you with a better user experience;

!
•   detecting, preventing, or otherwise addressing fraud, abuse, security, or technical issues with
our services; and
•   enforcing legal claims.
7. Keeping Your Personal Information Safe
We employ a variety of physical and technical measures to keep your personal information safe
and to prevent unauthorised access to, use or disclosure of it. Databases are stored on secure
servers and we control who has access to them (using both physical and electronic means).
Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access
our Services, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share
a password with anyone. We cannot absolutely guarantee the security of the internet, external
networks, or your own device, accordingly any online communications (e.g. information
provided by e-mail, through our Website or our Apps) are at your own risk.
8. Storage and Retention
Where we store your personal information
We are a multinational company with group companies in the United States, United Kingdom,
Australia, Poland, and the United Arab Emirates. Where possible, our data is hosted and stored
within the European Economic Area or with partners protected by Privacy Shield agreements.
When necessary, the information that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a
destination outside the United Kingdom and the European Economic Area (“EEA”), and may
also be processed by staff operating outside the United Kingdom or the EEA who work for us or
for one of our partners. Whenever data is transferred outside of the UK or EEA, we will take all
steps reasonably necessary to ensure that any transferred personal information is treated securely
and in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
Data Retention
Fresha will store personal data as long as Partner accounts continue to use our software, and for a
period of not more than 24 months thereafter. Users may elect to have their data removed from
Fresha either by contacting the Partner directly or by contacting users on Fresha.com. In the case
that a Partner explicitly indicates their intention to cease to use our software and have their data
deleted, personally identifiable information stored with their account shall be encrypted and/or
removed. Other information related to activity on the Apps will be retained for reporting and
analytical purposes, or other purposes at set forth in Section 9.
9. Disclosing Your Personal Information
Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not sell, trade, rent, or otherwise share
the personal information that we collect with third parties, unless you ask or authorise us to do
so. However, there are occasions where we may need to disclose your personal information.
Page 8! of 12
!
!
Where we do so, any such disclosure will be on the basis that these third parties are required to
keep the information we give them confidential and secure, and will not use it for any other
purpose than to carry out the services they are performing for us. We may disclose personal
information as follows:
• to affiliated companies (e.g., subsidiaries and other companies owned by or controlled by
Fresha);
•   to service providers that are hired by us to provide administrative and communication
services on our behalf, such as website hosting, the processing and delivery of mailings,
providing customer support, or providing credit card processing services;
•   to Partners where you have purchased services from a Partner through Fresha, or participated
in an offer, contest or other activity sponsored or offered through Fresha on behalf of the
Partner. We may also provide Partners with other personal information about you on your
Fresha account to send customised offers, to validate the purchases, to aid and troubleshoot
redemption, to combat fraud, as part of legal proceedings affecting Fresha and the Partner, to
facilitate a direct relationship between Partners and customers, and to enable Partners to
communicate electronically with customers who make purchases from the Partner;
•   when you rate or review a Service which you have purchased, your rating, review, photo,
your first name and last initial will be published on the Fresha app and may appear on third
party websites. For Partners whose businesses have received reviews on the Fresha
Marketplace, these reviews may be syndicated on third party websites;
•   to business partners and other advertisers as part of an offer, contest, distribution partnership,
or other activity that is provided by or in conjunction with Fresha and its business partners
and in which you have elected to participate. For example, if you are referred to Fresha from
a business partner's website or through an invitation facilitated by or in conjunction with a
Fresha business partner, Fresha may provide that business partner with contact information
and transactional information;
•   to the public when any user of the Fresha app access your favourites page. You may,
however, hide this information from the public by marking your favourites page as private;
•   to third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our
assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a
change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal information in
the same way as set out in this policy; and
•   to our professional advisors.

If You Are a Partner
We may share some or all of your personal information, including but not limited to booking
information, staff member names, Partner offerings, ratings and reviews, prices and discounts,
appointment availability, and related data (collectively "Partner Information") with end users
who have signed up or registered for Fresha and with Fresha business partners and affiliates with
which Fresha is working:
• we may feed Partner information to third party websites (excluding customer lists), which
may result in Partner information appearing on a third-party website, mobile application or in
search engine results; and such results may include a corresponding link to schedule an
appointment through Fresha;
•   Fresha may contact Partner employees through email to invite them to create a Fresha
account with a restricted login;
•   we may use certain contact information to promote your goods and services through a variety
of online and offline advertising and promotional media, including, but not limited to
Google, Google AdWords, Facebook Ads, Twitter, e-mail distribution lists, and third-party
business partners and affiliates; or
•   if you have participated in any joint Partner offerings or promotions with other Partners,
Fresha may disclose your personal information to its Partners and/or advertisers, as part of
such offer, contest, or other activity that is provided by or in conjunction with Fresha and its
business partners and in which you have elected to participate.
Aggregated Data
We may use aggregated non-personally identifiable data to:
• assist us to better understand how our customers are using the Services,
•   provide our customers with further information regarding the uses and benefits of the
Services,
•   enhance small business productivity, including by creating useful business insights from that
aggregated data and allowing you to benchmark your business’s performance against that
aggregated data, and
•   otherwise to improve the Services.
10. Disclosures Required by Law
We are subject to the law like everyone else. We may be required to give information to legal
and/or regulatory authorities if they so request, or if they have the proper authorisation such as a
search warrant or court order.
Page 10

We also may need to retain and disclose certain personal information about you to legal and/or
regulatory authorities and to appropriate agencies to conduct anti-money laundering checks and
to assist with fraud prevention. We will disclose this information as is required by law.
11. Links to Third Party Websites
This Privacy Policy applies solely to the personal information collected by Fresha and does not
apply to third party websites. Fresha is not responsible for the privacy policies of third party
websites. You should read the privacy policies of other websites before providing them with any
personal information about you.
12. Your Rights
We want you to remain in control of your personal information. Part of this is making sure you
understand your legal rights, which are as follows:
• where your personal information is processed on the basis of consent, the right to withdraw
that consent;
•   the right to confirmation as to whether or not we are holding any of your personal
information and, if we are, to obtain a copy of it;
•   from 25 May 2018, the right to have certain information provided to you in a portable
electronic format (where technically feasible);
•   the right to have inaccurate personal information rectified;
•   the right to object to your personal information being used for marketing or profiling, or on
the basis of our or a third party’s legitimate interests;
•   the right to restrict how your personal information is used; and
•   the right to be forgotten, which allows you to have your personal information erased in
certain circumstances (though this is not an absolute right and may not apply if we need to
continue using it for a lawful reason).
If you would like further information about any of your rights or wish to exercise them, please
contact us using the details given in Section 2.
Please keep in mind that there are exceptions to the rights above and, though we will always try
to respond to your satisfaction, there may be situations where we are unable to do so (for
example, because the information no longer exists or there is an exception which applies to your
request).
If you are not happy with our response, or you believe that your information protection or
privacy rights have been infringed, you should contact the UK Information Commissioner's
Page 11

Office, which oversees information protection compliance in the United Kingdom. Details of
how to do this can be found at www.ico.org.uk.
13. Updating this Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy at any time. When we do, we will post a notification on the
main page of our Website and we will also revise the updated date at the bottom of this page. We
encourage users to frequently check this page for any changes to stay informed about how we are
helping to protect the personal information we hold.
