How does the Freeview mobile app use non-personal data?
The Freeview mobile app only records non-personal statistics about usage of the application in order to improve and better tailor the application for all users. If you do not wish for the Freeview mobile app to record these statistics, you may switch this off within the settings menu. To use the app you will need to enable access to location services or provide your postcode to allow for you to receive the correct content for your region. We do not store your postcode as this information is only used to assign your region when you first set up the application (you may need to re-enter your region from time to time).
How long do we retain data for?
We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so. Such legitimate business interests include for example, to deal with any requests made by you, to provide you with a service or any help you have requested, to complete a competition or promotion we are running, to complete research insight or analysis, or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
