How we use and disclose your personal information
We will ask you to provide us with certain up-to-date personal information about yourself in the provision of using our services. This will normally be collected as part of our sales process or during the registration process for some services.
This information includes contact details such as name, contact information and payment details. If you represent a company or organisation we will also require the company name, company registration number and TVA number, where applicable. This personal information may change from time to time but can only be collected when you voluntarily give it to us. The information you agree to supply to us must be true, current, complete and accurate in all respects and you agree to notify us immediately of any changes to that information. Similarly, we strive to ensure the information we maintain about you is current, complete and accurate and we respond to requests to correct inaccurate information as soon as possible.
We will use your information to facilitate and complete your transaction and, if necessary, may disclose your personal information to a party or provider to the transaction to do so. Your personal information may also be disclosed; if required to do so for legal reasons, to our agents and contractors in order to provide our services (on the understanding that information will be kept confidential), to any law enforcement agencies once we are satisfied as to the circumstances of the request, and/or to enforce our rights. If we sell or integrate our business with another we may pass your information to our advisers and those of prospective purchasers for this purpose (on the understanding that information will be kept confidential).
