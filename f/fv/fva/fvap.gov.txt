Privacy Policy
Privacy Act Statement - If you choose to provide us with personal information - like filling out a Contact Us form with e-mail and/or postal addresses - we only use that information to respond to your message or request. We will only share the information you give us with another government agency if your inquiry relates to that agency, or as otherwise required by law. We never create individual profiles or give it to any private organizations. FVAP.gov never collects information for commercial marketing. While you must provide an e-mail address or postal address for a response other than those generated automatically in response to questions or comments that you may submit, we recommend that you NOT include any other personal information, especially Social Security numbers. The Social Security Administration offers additional guidance on sharing your Social Security number.

Use of Measurement and Customization Technology (i.e., “cookies”) - This website uses measurement and customization technology known as a "cookies." Cookies are used to remember a user's online interactions with a website or online application in order to conduct measurement and analysis of usage or to customize the user's experience.  These cookies are enabled by default once the user enters the FVAP.gov website, as the information gathered by the statistics aggregator depends on them.  Opt-out instructions for those wishing to disable cookies can be found below.
There are two kinds of cookies used on this website. A persistent or multi-session cookie (Tier 2) is saved to a file on a user's hard drive and is called up the next time that user visits a website. Session-based cookies are temporary in nature and assist users with the use of FVAP’s automated tools and are deleted once the visitor closes the browser.
Tier 2 cookies are used to distinguish between summary statistics for users who have been to the site before and those that are visiting the site for the first time. The Federal Voting Assistance Program does not gather, request, record, require, collect or track any Internet users' personally identifiable information (PII) through these processes. FVAP.gov uses Tier 2 cookies to remember whether a website visitor prefers to view the default homepage or an alternative page geared towards more specific content.
Session-based cookies are used to tie together a user with his/her data as the user steps through the automated tools for completion of the Federal Post Card Application and Federal Write-In Absentee Ballot.  Upon closing the browser, all session-based cookies are deleted.
The Federal Voting Assistance Program does not gather, request, record, require, collect or track any Internet users' PII through either of these processes.
FVAP.gov collects aggregate statistics of website visitor characteristics, traffic, and activity. This information is used to assess what content is of most and least interest, determine technical design specifications, and identify system performance or problem areas. The software records a variety of data, including IP addresses (the locations of computers or networks on the Internet), unique visits, page views, hits, referring websites, and which hyperlinks have been clicked. Tier 2 cookies are used to distinguish between summary statistics for users who have been to the site before and those that are visiting the site for the first time.
The Federal Voting Assistance Program does not use the information associated with cookies to track individual user activity on the Internet outside Defense Department websites, and without the user's explicit consent, nor does FVAP share the data obtained through such technologies with other departments or agencies. The Federal Voting Assistance Program does not keep a database of information obtained from the use of cookies.
Opting Out - Cookies are enabled by default once the user enters the FVAP.gov website, as the information gathered by the statistics aggregator depends on them. However, users can choose not to accept the use of these cookies by changing the settings on their local computer's web browser. Please Note:   By changing your settings and opting out of the use of cookies, some functions of the FVAP.gov website may be disabled to include use of the FPCA and FWAB automated tools.  This is due to functionality of the tools requiring the use of session-based cookies to tie individual users to data on the server as information is submitted.  If these session-based cookies are blocked, the user will be unable to advance past the first page of the automated tool.
The USA.gov website,  http://www.usa.gov/optout_instructions.shtml, provides general instructions on how to opt out of cookies and other commonly used web measurement and customization technologies. Opting out of cookies still permits users to access comparable information and services; however, it may take longer to navigate or interact with the website if a user is required to fill out certain information repeatedly.

The Privacy Act (PA) regulates the federal government's collection, maintenance, use and dissemination of personal information about U.S. citizens and aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence. Among the rights afforded under the Privacy Act is an individual's right to obtain copies of records maintained on him/her if the information contained in agency files, retrievable by the individual's name or other identifier, is not exempt from release under the provisions of the law.
