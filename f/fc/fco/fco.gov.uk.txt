Privacy and cookies
The FCO processes personal data for the purposes of promoting and protecting internationally the interests of the United Kingdom and its citizens and contributing to a stronger world community. Recipients of the personal data we may hold on you may include other UK Government Departments and public authorities.
The FCO is fully compliant with the Data Protection Act 1998. Read and download a copy of the charter.
1. Registration information
You do not have to register to use the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website, but you do need to register to receive updates about the site.
The registration information we require as mandatory for you to register is: your username (which does not need to be your real name), a password, and e-mail address. This information is stored securely on our database. Until such time as you choose to delete your account, your details are stored so that you do not need to re-register when you come back to the site.
You can change your registration preferences, e-mail address and and login details through the website at any time. If you wish to amend your personal profile, please click on the 'Subscribe' link at the top of the page, log in to your account, and check/uncheck the options available. If you are no longer interested in receiving FCO email alerts and wish to be removed from our database, click on the 'Unsubscribe' link on the same page and simply enter your username and password.
2. Feedback
You can send a message to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office using our Feedback form. If you are asking for information we do not already publish on the site, we will deal with your query. In doing so we may need to contact other Government Departments to find answers to your questions. If your question is technical, we may need to pass it to our technology supplier. In such cases we will only pass on personal data if it is necessary to do so, and we will not keep your personal data or records of our correspondence longer than necessary.
3. Cookie policy
In this section you will find information on what cookies may be set when you visit a FCO website and how to reject or delete those cookies.
When we provide services, we want to make them easy, useful and reliable. Where services are delivered on the internet, this sometimes involves placing small amounts of information on your device, for example, computer or mobile phone. These include small files known as cookies. They cannot be used to identify you personally.
These pieces of information are used to improve services for you through, for example:
enabling a service to recognise your device so you don't have to give the same information several times during one task
recognising that you may already have given a username and password so you don't need to do it for every web page requested
measuring how many people are using services, so they can be made easier to use and there's enough capacity to ensure they are fast
You can manage these small files yourself and learn more about them through at www.direct.gov.uk/managingcookies.
3.1. How to control and delete cookies
The FCO will not use cookies to collect personally identifiable information about you. However, if you wish to restrict or block the cookies which are set by FCO websites, or indeed any other website, you can do this through your browser settings.

Alternatively, you may wish to visit www.aboutcookies.org which contains comprehensive information on how to do this on a wide variety of browsers. You will also find details on how to delete cookies from your machine as well as more general information about cookies.
Please be aware that restricting cookies may impact on the functionality of FCO websites.
If you wish to view your cookie code, just click on a cookie to open it. You'll see a short string of text and numbers. The numbers are your identification card, which can only be seen by the server that gave you the cookie.
