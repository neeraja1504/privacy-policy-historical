YOUR SECURITY ****F1i.com takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, your information is protected both online and off-line.
Online Security
Whenever one of our registration or order forms asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'.
Offline Security
While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to your information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage.
LINKS TO EXTERNAL SITES
F1i.com may offer links to other sites so that you can conveniently access relevant content and visit our vendors and advertisers. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We urge you to inquire about the privacy policy of any Web site before providing any personally identifiable information.
OPTING OUT AND CHANGING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
Information provided at the time of Registration or submission from a user who is 13 years of age or over may be used for marketing and promotional purposes by F1i.com and our affiliates and / or companies, which have been prescreened by F1i.com. We provide visitors the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications that are not directly related to our site when we first request registration or order information.
After you've chosen to opt out, we will do our best to ensure that you do not receive additional messages or information from us, but are not responsible for further contacts that derive from activities to which you previously consented. Any information previously given to our vendors, advertisers and others cannot be rescinded. We may retain personal information in our files despite your request to delete it in order to cooperate with law enforcement personnel or third parties to investigate possible crimes or resolve disputes; to enforce our User Agreement; to evaluate technical difficulties with the site; and for other internal purposes. Because we follow standard back-up procedures to assure the integrity of our computer and database systems, and due to technical constraints, it may not be technically possible to completely remove all of your personal information from our files.
