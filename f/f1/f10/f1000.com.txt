monitor site usage and therefore improve user experience, and Google Adwords which uses cookies to enable
our ads to be shown across the Internet to those who have previously visited our site.
CONTROL OF COOKIES
Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser settings to notify you
when a cookie is sent, and then you can then choose to accept or decline the cookie. However, this may mean
that any preferences you set on a Site will be lost or you will not be able to use the auto login or remember me
