In keeping with that goal, we have developed this Privacy Policy to explain our practices for the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information.
This Policy applies to our retail stores, our Web Sites, mobile apps, call centres and all other channels in which Best Buy collects and uses your personal information. All references to "Web Sites" in this Privacy Policy mean www.bestbuy.ca, www.geeksquad.ca, or other Best Buy provided Web sites or mobile apps where this Privacy Policy is posted.

What we collect
The types of information we collect depend on the nature of your interaction with us.
Personal information
Personal information is information that can identify an individual or information about an identifiable individual. We may collect personal information such as:
your contact information - e.g., name, postal address, telephone number, and email address;
your personal preferences - e.g., product wish lists, language preferences, and marketing consent
your transaction information - e.g., products purchased, method of payment, amount paid, signature, and credit or debit card number.
In addition, we may collect the following types of information:
we may ask you for your postal code, for example, to assist us with market research, planning our flyer distribution, and other marketing communications;
we may collect certain data when you visit our Web Sites, such as your IP address, the type of browser you are using or the referring URL; or
we may collect and summarize customer information in an aggregate format for internal statistical and research purposes. We may, for example, summarize our data to determine that a certain percentage of contest entrants are male, aged 18 to 25.
You may choose not to provide us with your personal information. However, if you make this choice we may not be able to provide you with the product, service, or information that you requested. For example, we can only offer you a Best Buy credit card if you have provided us with certain financial information.
Supplementing Information
From time to time we may supplement information you give us with information from other sources, such as information validating your address or other available information you have provided us. This is to help us maintain the accuracy of the information we collect and to help us provide better service.
How we collect and use information

Listed here are some further examples of the ways that we collect personal information directly from you and how we use it.
In-Store and Online Purchases
When you purchase a product or service from Best Buy or a Web Site, you may need to provide us with contact and payment information (such as credit card information) so that we can process your request or complete your transaction and communicate with you regarding your purchase. We may also need to collect contact information to provide certain services, including delivery services, reserve and pick-up, product servicing, in-home consultations or installations, and extended warranty coverage. If you provide us your email address, we will also collect your email address for the purpose of sending you an e-receipt. We also may use your contact information to send you promotional information. You can opt-out by following the instructions under “Unsubscribe” below.
Returns and Exchanges
Our goal is to ensure that you are completely satisfied with your purchase and to this end, Best Buy offers a Return Policy. For Best Buy to continue to offer our Return Policy, we ask for personal information such as your name, address, and telephone number for the purposes of detecting and preventing fraud. You may also be asked to produce photo ID for verification purposes only.
Applying for the Best Buy Credit Card
When you apply for a Best Buy credit card, certain contact and financial information is collected and reviewed by our credit card provider, Fédération des Caisses Desjardins du Québec (“Desjardins”), to approve, establish and maintain credit card accounts. Desjardins has its own privacy policy, available at https://www.desjardins.com/ca/privacy/ which governs its relationship with you. We also encourage you to read their privacy statement provided with your credit card application.
Insurance Replacement
When working to replace goods that are covered under your insurance policy, we will need some basic information, such as your contact information, insurance claim number, and the name of your claim adjuster, so we can process your quote in a timely manner and bill your insurance company directly for you.
Purchase Follow-Up, Surveys, and Customer Research
Following a purchase, we may send you a follow-up letter to thank you for your business, or we may contact you to ensure that you are completely satisfied with the delivery, setup, or installation of your new product.
We may use contact information collected in-store, online, or via our call centres to conduct occasional surveys and other customer research. These surveys are entirely voluntary and you may easily decline to participate. The information obtained through our surveys and customer research is used to help us understand our customers, to enhance our product and service offerings, promotions and events, and/or to assist in the selection of store locations.
Online Accounts

We use this information to create your account, process your payment, contact and correspond with you about your order, respond to your inquiries, and monitor functions of our Web Sites that you choose to use, such as Customer Reviews. If you purchase an e-gift card, we collect the recipient’s name, email address and any message you provide in order to send the gift card on your behalf. We rely on you to ensure that you have obtained all necessary consents to provide this information to us.
If you choose to ship an order to a third party, you represent and warrant that you have obtained all necessary consents from the third party to permit Best Buy to collect, use, and disclose the third party’s personal information for the purposes of fraud prevention and processing and shipping the order.

Newsletters or Updates
Best Buy offers a variety of newsletters and promotional communications. If you sign-up or are subscribed for our newsletter or other promotional communications, we will send you communications that may be tailored based on your interests, preferences and behaviour. You may choose to stop receiving these communications at any time.

The information you provide will be used to send a one-time email to your friend, inviting them to our Web Sites. We will not add your friend to a mailing list and will not send them further email unless they choose to receive such communications from us or where otherwise legally permitted. If you provide us with personal information concerning another individual (e.g., email address), you represent and warrant that you have a personal or family relationship with the recipient and obtained all necessary consents from that individual to enable us to use that personal information for the identified purpose.
Subscription Services and Activations
Best Buy may offer activation of certain products and services like cellular plans, satellite services, Internet services or smart-home services. These activations may require that certain contact and financial information be collected and provided by Best Buy to the respective service providers as part of the activation process. For example, a cellular carrier may need to perform a credit check prior to activation so certain identification such as a government-issued ID number and your credit card number may be provided to the carrier for that purpose.
Call Centres
Best Buy operates customer support call centres to accept and address your questions, concerns, or complaints. When you contact our call centres, we may ask for personal information to help us respond to your inquiry or to verify your identity.

We may also monitor or record your telephone discussions with our customer support representatives for training purposes and to ensure service quality. If you do not want your call to be monitored and recorded, please let us know and we will provide you with an alternative means of communicating with us.
