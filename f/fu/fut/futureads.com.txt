Future Ads' Privacy Policy
FUTUREADS.COM PRIVACY POLICY
This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) explains what information Future Ads LLC (“Future Ads”, also referred to as “we”, “us”, or “our”) collects from individuals who visit the Futureads.com website (the “Site”). The Privacy Policy also explains how Future Ads uses and maintains that information.
Changes to the Privacy Policy
If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on the Site under the tab “Privacy Policy”, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
We reserve the right to update or modify the Privacy Policy at any time. If we make any changes to the Privacy Policy, we will post the updated Privacy Policy on our Site, so please review it frequently.
The Privacy Policy applies only to information collected on the Site and not to information collected or obtained from other sources.
Information Collected
We collect two kinds of information through the Site. The first kind of information is Personally Identifiable Information that can identify you as a specific individual - such as your name and email address (“PII”). We only collect PII when you have contacted us directly (see “Collection of Personally Identifiable Information” below). The second kind of information is the kind of non-personally identifiable information (“NPII”) collected and stored automatically by many websites. It includes, for example, information about your Internet service provider, operating system, type of browser, geographic location, and pages viewed on the Site. Although this information is related to you, it is not associated with your PII and cannot be linked to you personally.
If you do not want your information to be collected and used as provided in this Privacy Policy, you should not access or use the Site.
Collection of Personally Identifiable Information
PII is collected by the Site only when you provide it to us by using one of the following Site features:
When you communicate with us via email under the “Contact Us” tab. We ask that you provide us your name, email address and phone number so that we can send you a proper response.
On each sign up page for Ads, Apps, and Games, you are requested to submit (a) your name, (b) your company name, (c) your address, (d) a username and password, (e) your email address, and (f) such other information as Future Ads may request from time to time as indicated on the sign up page or by other notice to you.
Social Media Features and Widgets: The Site includes Social Media Features and Widgets (“Features and Widgets”), such as Future Ads’ profiles on Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin, and Crunchbase, or other interactive mini-programs that run on our Site. These Features and Widgets may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our Site, and may set a cookie to enable these functions properly. Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features and Widgets are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.
If you do not want us to collect your PII as described above or to use and share your PII as described further below in this Privacy Policy, you should NOT provide it to us through any of the Site features described above. By providing us with your PII through use of these features, you are authorizing our use and sharing of your PII as described in this Privacy Policy and any subsequent revisions to this Privacy Policy that we may publish on the Site.
Updating Your Personally Identifiable Information
We will retain your information for as long as needed to provide you services, or as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolution of disputes, and enforcement of our agreements. You may update, correct, amend or request to remove your PII from our systems by emailing us at info@FutureAds.com or by calling us at (866) 394-1786.
Children’s Privacy
The Site and all information, content and materials contained on the Site (in any form or media, the “Site Materials”) are neither intended for, nor directed to, nor to be accessed by, persons under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect PII from anyone under 13 years of age. We cannot and will not independently verify that all those who use the Site are at least 13 years old, but we will remove from our files any PII of anyone we discover to be under 13 years old.
Use and Sharing of Personally Identifiable Information
We reserve the right to use PII: (1) for the specific purpose for which such information was provided as stated above; (2) for the purposes disclosed at the time such information is provided; or (3) as disclosed in this Privacy Policy.
We do not share, sell or trade any of your PII with any third parties other than described herein. We may share your PII with our parent company and companies owned by our parent company (collectively "Related Companies"). Neither we nor our Related Companies contribute to or participate in cooperative databases, which give other companies access to your PII.
We and our Related Companies may provide access to your PII when legally required to do so, to cooperate with police investigations or other legal proceedings, to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the Site, to limit our legal liability and protect our rights or to protect the rights, property or safety of other users or the public.
We and/or our Related Companies may also disclose your PII to outside companies and consultants that help bring you the services we offer. For example, we and our Related Companies may work with outside companies and consultants to: (a) manage a database of customer information; (b) assist in distributing e-mails; (c) assist with direct marketing and data collection; (d) provide data storage and analysis; (e) provide fraud prevention; (f) provide customer service by phone; and/or (g) provide other services designed to assist us in maximizing our business potential and maintaining our Site. We and our Related Companies require that these outside companies and consultants agree to keep confidential all information we share with them, and use the information only to perform their obligations to us.
In addition, if we or our Related Companies go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your PII will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified by a prominent notice on the Site of any such change in ownership or control of your PII. We also reserve the right to disclose PII as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process.
