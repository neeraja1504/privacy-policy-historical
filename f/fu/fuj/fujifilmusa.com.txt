FUJIFILM Holdings America Corporation
Privacy Policy
Our Commitment to Privacy. FUJIFILM Holdings America Corporation cares about your privacy. This Privacy Policy applies to FUJIFILM Holdings America Corporation and its direct U.S. subsidiaries listed at www.fujifilmusa.com/privacy/pdf/hlus_pp_company_listing.pdf.
FUJIFILM Holdings America Corporation and direct subsidiaries to which this Privacy Policy is applicable are collectively referred to as “FUJIFILM” or “we.”
This Privacy Policy describes our privacy practices in relation to the use of our websites, applications, affiliated sites, services, and programs, including attendance at events and marketing activities, and will help you better understand our privacy practices and the choices you can make about the way your personal data is collected and used.
Through FUJIFILM’s site, you will be able to link to sites maintained by other companies within the global group of companies headed by FUJIFILM Holdings Corporation (the “FUJIFILM Group”), as well as unaffiliated third party sites. As more fully described below, each of these sites may be governed by a different privacy policy or statement. We suggest you check the privacy link typically located in the footer of each web page to access and review the applicable privacy policy or statement. Since privacy policies or statements may change periodically, we also suggest that you occasionally re-visit them.
Please read this Privacy Policy carefully and contact us at InfoSec-NA@fujifilm.com if you have any questions about our privacy practices, your personal data, rights, or choices.
This Privacy Policy is effective as of August 13, 2018.
The Information We Collect The information we collect from visitors to FUJIFILM’s site helps us improve our site and provide better service to you. We collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store personal data (such as your name, mailing address, email address, phone, and fax numbers) when needed to provide our services and for our operational and business purposes as described in this Privacy Policy. Occasionally you may also choose to provide us with what may be considered sensitive personal data (collectively, “personal data”) such as financial and bank account numbers.
We want to be clear about our privacy practices so that you can make informed choices about the use of your information, and we encourage you to contact us at InfoSec-NA@fujifilm.com at any time with questions or concerns.
The information we collect falls into two broad categories: (1) information you voluntarily provide to us and (2) information that is automatically collected.
Information you voluntarily provide to us. Generally, you can visit FUJIFILM's site without providing any personal or sensitive personal data. However, on some pages, we collect personal data in order to provide a service or carry out a transaction requested by you. See below for what personal data is collected and how it is used. We may also ask for feedback relating to our goods or services. Participation is voluntary and you are not required to provide this information. There generally is no negative effect on you if you choose not to provide your personal data. However, since personal data may be needed to process an order, if you choose not to participate, we may not be able to perform a requested service or complete a transaction.
Information Collected Automatically. Our servers, logs and other technologies collect and store certain personal and non-personal data such as your IP address, machine operating system, geolocations, type of system, and selection preferences that is generated automatically as you navigate through our sites. By using our website, you agree to the processing of the data collected about you for the stated purposes below. We use a standard feature found in browser software called a "cookie" used to store and manage user preferences, deliver targeted advertising, enable content, and gather analytic and usage data, for example. The use of cookies and other tracking technologies is standard across websites and apps through which information is collected about your online activities across applications, website, or other servicers. You can choose to accept or decline cookies and, while most web browsers automatically accept cookies, you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. This may prevent you from taking full advantage of our sites.
What is a cookie? A cookie is a small text file that is placed on a computer or other device and is used to identify the user or device and to collect information. Cookies help to track user trends and patterns and also relieve users from having to re-enter their preferences on certain areas of the site where they have previously entered preference information. The cookie types we use to collect personal data and non-personal data include the following attributes: session cookies, persistent cookies, third-party cookies.
What is a web beacon? A web beacon is an often-transparent graphic image, usually no larger than 1 pixel x 1 pixel that is placed on a website or in an email that is used to monitor the behavior of the user visiting the website or opening the email. It is often used in combination with cookies. We use web beacons to access cookies and to count users who visit our site or open email messages. We collect this information to improve the delivery of our web pages to you and to measure traffic on our site. We sometimes use the non-identifying and aggregate information that is collected as described above to enhance the design of our site and help us understand the needs of our visitors.
What is a “Share” button? Our website also contains “Share” buttons. Any user who wishes to share content in this manner must have already provided login credentials to the “Share” site. We do not collect any user login information for third-party “Share” sites including those listed below. We have no influence regarding the scope of the data which is collected with the aid of the “Share” buttons, and therefore can only provide you with information for the third-party sites that have been or are integrated into our website as follows:

This website uses Google Analytics , a website analytics service provided by Google, Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (“Google”). Google Analytics uses cookies and web beacons (defined above) and the information generated by the cookie is usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. If IP anonymization is activated on this website, your full IP address will typically be sent to a Google server in the U.S. and then shortened. Google uses this information on our behalf to evaluate the use of our website by you, to compile reports on the website activities and to provide other services related to the website and internet usage to us. We use the code “ga(‘set’, ‘anonymizelp’, true)” to ensure the anonymous collection of IP address (“IP masking”), which processes IP addresses in a shortened form and direct personal reference can be excluded. You can prevent Google’s collection of the data generated by the cookie and related use of the website, including your IP address, as well as the processing of such data by Google by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available under the following link: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.

We retain personal data for as long as we reasonably require it for business and legal purposes.

If we cannot honor your request within the 30-day period, we will inform you when we will be able to provide access. In the unlikely event that we cannot provide you access to this information, we will explain why we cannot do so. We will ask for proof of your identity in order to confirm your identity and that you are seeking access to personal data belonging to you, and also sufficient information about your interaction with us so that we can locate any relevant data. We may also charge a fee for providing you with a copy of your data (except where this is not permissible under local law).
Correction to and deletion of personal data: In some jurisdictions, you have the right to correct or amend your personal data if it is inaccurate or requires updating, and also the right to request deletion of your personal data.
