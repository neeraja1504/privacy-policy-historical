All of these network plug-ins essentially work according to the same basic principle as described below:
When you access our website, the network plug-ins can potentially create a direct connection between the user’s browser and the server of the respective network. The content of the relevant plug-in will be directly transmitted from the network to your browser, which will integrate it into the website. We have no influence regarding the scope of the data which is collected with the aid of the plug-in. Therefore, we can only inform you about the information which is publicly accessible according to our current state of knowledge (see above). The integrated plug-in informs the network that the user has accessed our website and informs the network of the user’s IP address. If the user is logged in to the network of this plug-in at that point in time, the network will be able to link the visit with the user’s account.
If the user interacts with these plug-ins, for example in the case of Twitter by clicking on “Tweet This” or with Facebook by clicking the ‘I like’ button or making a comment, the corresponding information will be transmitted directly from the user’s browser to the network where it will then be stored. Furthermore, additional personal data can also be transmitted and stored there, for example the user’s IP address, personal browser settings and other parameters.
If you are a member of the respective network and do not want it to collect information about you via our website and to link this information with the data that the network has already stored about you, then please close this website, log out from your user account for the respective network and afterwards visit our website once again.
If you are not a member of the network or you have logged from the network before visiting our website, the possibility still exists that the network will ascertain (at least) your IP address and store it. Please note that this information is already exchanged when you visit our website, whether you interact with the plug-ins or not.

Google Analytics
This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA ("Google"). Google Analytics uses so-called cookies, i.e. text files that are stored on your computer and that allow an analysis of the way you use our website. The information generated by the cookie is usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. Google complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Agreement and is registered with the US Department of Commerce's ES-US Privacy Shield Program (for details and individual registrations go to www.privacyshield.gov). However, if IP anonymisation is activated on this website, your IP address will be truncated by Google beforehand within member states of the European Union or other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be sent to a Google server in the US and shortened there. Google uses this information on our behalf to evaluate the use of our website by you, to compile reports on the website activities and to provide other services related to the website and internet usage to us.
Please note that we use the code "ga('set', 'anonymizeIp', true);” to ensure the anonymous collection of IP addresses (so-called IP masking). As a result, IP addresses are processed in shortened form, which means that direct personal reference can be excluded.
You can deactivate the use of cookies via your browser settings at any time. Please note, however, if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use certain or all features of our website. Furthermore, you can prevent the collection by Google of the data generated by the cookie and related to your use of the website (including your IP address) as well as the processing of such data by Google by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available under the following link http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.
