AGAIN, CAREFULLY READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY STATEMENT BECAUSE YOUR REGISTRATION AND MEMBERSHIP TO AND USE OF THIS WEBSITE WILL EXPRESSLY SIGNIFY THAT YOU AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND THAT YOU CONSENT TO THE USE OF ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT YOU SUPPLY OR THAT IS COLLECTED ABOUT YOU AS DETAILED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY.

Information We Gather Automatically (Non- Personal Technical Data)
Each time an individual visits the Website, our servers collect certain non-personal technical information, including, but not necessarily limited to, the visitor’s IP Address, referral data and browser/platform type. This information is recorded by the standard operation of our Internet servers. We also count, track, and aggregate a visitor’s activity into our analysis of general traffic flows at the Website (e.g., tracking where traffic comes from, how traffic flows within the Website, etc.). The information collected in this regard either cannot identify who you are as an individual or is not used in that manner.
IP Address
An “IP Address” is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer or by your Internet service provider whenever you are surfing the Internet. We may use your IP addresses in cooperation with your Internet provider to identify you if we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our Terms of Use or to protect our service, the Website, registered users, members, affiliates or other third parties. An IP address can also provide some information concerning your whereabouts. We do this by converting your IP Address into a rough geographical location. We may merge information about visitors and the number of visits into group data, which may then, at our discretion, be shared on an aggregated basis with our third-party advertisers/affiliates. In those circumstances, your individual personal information is not disclosed, nor under those circumstances will we disclose your individual identity or personally identifiable data without your permission.
Like Most Websites, We Use Cookies/Browser Information/Web Beacons
We use cookies to store your preferences and to record session information for purposes such as ensuring that you are not repeatedly offered the same advertisements or to customize advertising and web page content for individual registered users and members. Cookies also enable our own system to recognize you when you visit the Website again and enable us to improve our service to you. Cookies are text files that may be sent to and saved by your web browser when you access a website; your web browser stores these cookies in a way associated with each website you visit, and you can generally see your cookies through your browser settings, depending on what browser you’re using. You must enable cookies from the Website in order to use many of the functions of the Website. Nevertheless, if you wish to reject or disable our cookies, you can configure your browser to do so. Instructions for disabling cookies can likely be found in your browser’s “Frequently Asked Questions” section. Please note, however, that the Website allows third parties who are presenting advertisements on some of our web pages to set and access their cookies on your computer in a process that we do not control. Cookies may also be used to compile aggregate information about areas of the Website visited most frequently. We reserve the right to automatically receive and record information from your web browser when you interact with the Website, such as your browser type and version, what sort of device you are using, your operating system and version, your language preference, the website or service that referred you to the Website, the date and time of each request you make to the Website, your screen display information, and information from any cookies we have placed on your web browser (as described hereinabove). We also sometimes detect whether you are using certain web browser extensions and store that information in a manner associated with your membership.
Similarly, a web beacon or pixel are types of code used by web developers which may also be embedded in a web page or email, and allows us or a third-party to see that you have looked at a particular web page. From time to time, we may run limited-time studies using web beacons, sometimes with third parties, to, for example, measure the effectiveness of our advertising or e-mail marketing/communications.
Information Related To Your Mobile Device
We also reserve the right to collect and store information related to your mobile device. In some cases, either we, or our mobile analytic provider, may receive, generate, or assign your mobile device a unique identifier. We may also request you to provide your mobile number to enable new products and improve our product. Our mobile applications collect certain information automatically, such as the type of mobile device you use and the location of your device. You must first provide permission through your device before the application obtains such location information from technologies like GPS.
Required And/or Optional Information For Becoming A Registered User And Member
When any adult registered user logs on to the Website as a member of this Website, the registered user and/or member may provide certain personal, as well as demographic, information which may include, but is not necessarily limited to, their name, address, age, gender, e-mail address, username and password, personal interests or affiliations and geographical location. This Website collects any and all such information and includes it in its customer database.
The choice to provide us with your personal information is always yours. However, your decision to withhold particular information may result in limiting our ability to respond to your inquiries or provide you with the services you requested. If a new purpose is identified for the use of the information collected, the new purpose will be explained in an updated privacy policy prior to its new use. Unless such new purpose is required by law, your consent is required before information can be used for that purpose. Your continued use of the Website after the posting of the revised privacy policy shall be considered consent to the new use of the information. Demographic information may be compiled and shared in the aggregate with third parties, but no personal details will be traceable or associated with specific individuals at any time. Note that, during the membership process, third-party billing service providers will collect personally identifiable information required to process payments for the Website’s services. We retain information (name and address) to correctly identify you in dealings with these third-party billing service providers. The Website does not control any and all additional information gathered by third-party billing service providers. As such, please review the applicable third-party billing service provider’s Website for its own policies governing the collection and usage of such information.
If the Website features or conducts any special events, special promotions, third-party offers, contests or polls, a registered user or member of the Website may be asked to provide information in order to participate. If the registered user and member voluntarily provide that information, all such information may be collected by the Website and included in its customer database. When a registered user or member of this Website requests web pages from the Website’s server or clicks on banners or other third-party hypertext links, the Website will automatically collect some information or data about the registered user or member, including the IP address of the registered user or member. The information collected may also indicate any special preferences or requests of the registered user or member. All such information and data will be collected by the Website and included in our customer database. If a registered user or member sends any personal communication or correspondence, by any means, to the Website, or any to any of the Website’s employees, agents or representatives, the Website may collect any information regarding that communication and include that information in its customer database.
Profile Information That You Provide and User Content
We encourage registered users to fill out their profiles as completely as possible. Any communications from other registered users are done via our internal systems, which are used to match the message to you and generate an e-mail notification without disclosing any information aside from your chosen screen name. Accordingly, other registered users may not obtain your personal contact information such as your name, email, or telephone number unless you share it with them. However, any and all personally identifiable information that you: (i) enter into your profile; (ii) include in communications with other registered users or members; (iii) disclose in any media (e.g., text, chat streams, graphical, audio, visual, or audio-visual); or (iv) post or display on the Website is indeed accessible by other registered users and members of the Website. We are therefore not responsible for the disclosure of your personal information in this manner, nor are we liable for any other privacy-related claims or issues arising from your own voluntary disclosure, posting or transmission of personal information via the Website. You hereby acknowledge and agree that you shall be solely responsible and liable for any and all damages, liability and/or other consequences, foreseen or unforeseen, of all information which you submit, publish, display, disseminate, or otherwise communicate through the Website even if a claim for damages or liability should arise after termination or cancellation of our services.
How We Use Your Personal Information
The personally identifiable information obtained from our users is used in a variety of ways.

You may be contacted by email to confirm or terminate registration, to notify you of changes in our Terms and Conditions, to deal with any issues particular to you, or to promote events, services, and/or products that we or third-party vendors may wish to bring to your attention.

The goal is to show you ads more tailored to your interests. Advertisements may relate to our site or to others. In addition, we belong to ad networks that may use your browsing history across participating websites to show you interest-based advertisements on those websites. You may see ads on participating websites based on how you browse our website and those sites.
You may get more information on opting-out of either interest-based advertising on our website, or interest-based advertising on other sites, by clicking here.
You may access third-party services through the Website by clicking on links from our third-party advertisers or business partners. We may also share information that you provide to us with those third-party providers.

How We Use Your E-Mail Address
As part of the Services, you may occasionally receive emails and other communications from us. Administrative communications relating to your Account (e.g., for purposes of Account recovery or password reset) are considered part of the Services for your Account, which you will not be able to opt-out from receiving. We also may send you other kinds of emails, of which you can opt-out by using the “Opt-Out” link in the emails themselves or going to the account section (link it) of your profile. By submitting your email address at the Website, you also agree to receive email marketing from us and our third-party advertisers. You may also opt-out from receiving marketing emails from third-party advertisers by clicking on the unsubscribe link on the email, following the instructions in the privacy policy of the third-party or going to the account section of your profile. For visitors located in the United States, you agree that registering or providing personal information to us constitutes consent, notwithstanding that your telephone number may be listed on the Federal Trade Commission’s Do-Not-Call List, that we or our designee retain the right, and you hereby expressly authorize us and/or our designee, to contact you via telemarketing or text messaging. Moreover, by registering with, or requesting information from us or another third-party advertisers at, or through, the Website, such action shall constitute your written consent to be contacted via e-mail, instant messaging, text messaging, direct mail and/or telemarketing by such third-party advertisers.
To Better Serve You, We Aggregate Information To Bring You Information That May Be Of Interest To You
We may share or disclose non-private information, aggregate information, or other non-personally identifying information with third parties that we do business with.
Website And Member Communications
Members of the Website can directly communicate with other members through messaging services that are part of the services we provide at the Website (e.g., mail, chat, or via comments). We may use personally identifiable information within your profile to send notifications of these communications to you, but your personally identifiable information is not disclosed to other members by us.
The Website also directly communicates with registered users and members through e-mail, instant messaging, and in some cases, downloaded executables thereby allowing our registered users and members to receive information when they are not on the Website. Our registered users and members can thereby remain current on internal communications and updates from other registered users, members or from us directly. The Website may also use personally identifiable information within your profile to send information to you that, in some cases, is targeted to your interests, such as special banners and promotions. If you do not want us to send you information on other third-party services or products, please contact us.
Analytic Applications
Personal Data is also collected to enable us to monitor and analyze web traffic and can be used to keep track of User behavior.
For example, Google Analytics is a web analysis service provided by Google Inc. (“Google”). Google utilizes the Data collected to track and examine the use of this Application, to prepare reports on its activities and share them with other Google services.
Application Data Collected
Information collected automatically from this Application (or third-party services employed in this Application) may include: the IP addresses of the computers utilized by the Users who use this Application, the URL addresses or domain (Uniform Resource Identifier) or domain name, the time of the request, the method utilized to submit the request to the server, the size of the file received in response, the numerical code indicating the status of the server's answer (successful outcome, error, etc.), the country of origin, the features of the browser and the operating system utilized by the user, the various time details per visit (e.g., the time spent on each page within the Application) and the details about the path followed within the Application with special reference to the sequence of pages visited, and other parameters about the device operating system and/or the user's IT environment.
Explanation of the Use of Application Data and User ID
Google may use the Data collected to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network. In that regard, Google Analytics makes use of a feature called user ID. This setup allows for a more accurate tracking of users by associating that user with the same ID over various sessions and devices. It is set up in a way that doesn’t allow Google to personally identify an individual or permanently identify a particular device.
The user ID extension might make it possible to connect Data from Google Analytics with other Data about the user collected by this Application. The opt-out link below will only opt you out for the device you are on, but not from tracking performed independently by us. Contact us via the email address provided in this privacy policy to object to the aforementioned tracking. To opt-out through the Google tool click here.
Referral Service
If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about the Website, we will ask you for your friend’s contact information. The Website will automatically send your friend an e-mail inviting them to visit the Website. The Website maintains this information for the sole purpose of sending this e-mail and tracking the success of the referral.
Third-Party Advertisers
We are able to offer our services to you, in part, based on your willingness to be targeted by our third-party advertisers. By allowing us to make the information you supply available to our third-party advertising affiliates/partners, you will receive information on products and services that may be of interest to you. As set forth hereinabove, this information may also be shared with our third-party advertisers on an aggregate basis. Please be advised however, that we do not control, and are not responsible for, the practices of our third-party advertisers. Please review the terms and privacy policy of any third-party advertiser that you may choose to contact.
Third-Party Offers
From time to time, we may sponsor or co-sponsor sweepstakes, offers, products, contests, or other services or events of interest to our registered users and members. In order to receive such offers, products or services, sweepstakes, or contests, your personal information will be shared with such third-party companies. We do this to ensure that they may provide their products and/or services to you without mandating that you first have to re-register. You may opt-out of receiving these communications by contacting us.
Service Providers
Like many businesses, we sometimes hire other companies to present offers, products, contests, or other services or events of interest to our members and registered users. Service Providers may assist us, by way of example, in sending emails, maintaining databases, or providing hosting services. When we employ a Service Provider to perform a function of this nature, we provide it with the information that it needs to perform its specific function, which may include personal data and other information that you provide to us via the Website. Please keep in mind, though, that we do not control, and are not responsible for, the practices of our Service Providers.

By accepting this Privacy Policy and using the Website and/or the services hereon, you waive and hold us, as well as our affiliates, content providers, and the operators of the Website harmless from any and all claims resulting from any and all of the foregoing action or as a result of any law enforcement authority’s investigations or inquiries.
The Security Of Your Information
Consistent with the policies set forth herein, the Website has adopted and implemented reasonable, appropriate and technologically feasible procedures for maintaining the security, accuracy and integrity of all personal information relating to registered users or members that is collected by the Website to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, modification or unauthorized destruction of data.
Your registration and member information is protected by a password for your privacy and security. We may enable additional security features in the future, in our sole discretion. You need to prevent unauthorized access to your account and information by creating a unique, secure, and protected password and limiting access to your computer and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account on the Website. We seek to protect your information (including your account information) to ensure that it is kept private; however, we cannot guarantee the security of any information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of user information at any time.
All registered users or members should consider any information provided to or collected by the Website as non-confidential, and consequently the Website assumes no liability or responsibility if any information relating to any subscriber is intercepted and/or used by an unintended recipient.
What Happens To Your Information If The Business Is Sold
