To ensure technical functionality and delivery of the Service; and
To provide ad-supported content offerings which are provided by marketers interested in reaching our general demographic audience.
4. How Your Information is Shared
4.1 Sharing by you
The Service is social by its very nature, so your participation in the Service will allow others to see your name and/or username, profile picture, and social profile.
Certain user-profile information, including without limitation a user's name, location, and any video or image content that such user has uploaded to the Service, may be displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within the Service or address your request for Company's services. Your account privacy settings allow you to limit the other users who can see the Personal Information in your user profile and/or what information in your user profile is visible to others. Any content you upload to your public user profile, along with any Personal Information or content that you voluntarily disclose online in a manner other users can view (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, etc.) becomes publicly available, and can be collected and used by others. Your user name may also be displayed to other users if and when you send messages or comments or upload images or videos through the Service and other users can contact you through messages and comments. Additionally, if you sign into the Service through a third party social networking site or service, your list of "friends" from that site or service may be automatically imported to the Service, and such "friends," if they are also registered users of the Service, may be able to access certain non-public information you have entered in your Service user-profile. Again, we do not control the policies and practices of any other third party site or service.
Some parts of our Service will enable you to share your interactions with our Service, such as content viewed, user generated content posted, and other social interactions. If you connect to our Service through a third party application (e.g., Facebook), then you further understand that we may automatically share your interactions with our Service with that third party application.
4.2 Sharing by us

Unless we tell you differently or you consent otherwise, these third parties do not have any right to use your Information beyond what is necessary to assist us in providing such products and services. Any uses of your Information by these third parties will remain governed by security and confidentiality obligations consistent with this Policy and applicable law.

To the extent that there is a conflict between the provisions of this Privacy Policy and the provisions of the User Site's privacy policy, if any, then the provisions of this Privacy Policy shall apply with respect to our use of Information and the User Site's privacy policy shall apply with respect to the User Site's use of Information.
5. The Security of Your Information
