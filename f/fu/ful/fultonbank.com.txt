Cookies are used within the online banking login process to identify a user's computer to better enhance security. If a cookie is not on the computer or the user changes computers, the user will be asked to re-authenticate. This process helps add an additional level of security for our customers.
Cookies cannot be used to capture your e-mail address, obtain data from your hard drive, or gain confidential or sensitive information about you. Additionally, cookies cannot be read by a website other than the one that set the cookie. Some websites, however, use cookies to obtain information from your browser. You can set your browser to notify you before accepting a cookie, so that you can control whether you accept or reject a cookie. If you do not accept cookies, your experience at our Sites may be impacted.
Click stream auditing is the process of collecting and analyzing information such as a web user’s IP address, web pages which referred a web surfer to our website, date and time, domain type, and when a web surfer has responded to an advertisement.
