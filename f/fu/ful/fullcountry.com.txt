SECURITY
We understand the importance of your personal information and have appropriate procedures in place to safeguard and secure the information we collect to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, maintain data accuracy and ensure the appropriate use of information.
We take website and credit card security extremely seriously and always endeavor to provide a secure, safe platform from which to conduct online transactions. We use the industry standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol, which encrypts information as it is transmitted over the internet. This encryption scrambles details such as credit card numbers, billing details and delivery addresses so that other computers are unable to decipher the information, ensuring privacy and security.
To ensure you are accessing a secure server, look for the unbroken key or closed lock symbol located either at the bottom left or top right of your browser window. If it appears, then SSL is active. You can double-check by looking at the URL. If SSL is active, then the first characters of the URL will read ‘https’ rather than just ‘http.’ It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and your computer.
Ensure you sign out when you have finished visiting our websites especially if you have accessed the websites from a shared computer.
GENERAL
By using our websites, you are consenting to the collection of information by us in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
