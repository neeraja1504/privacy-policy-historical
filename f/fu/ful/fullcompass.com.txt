How We Use Collected Information
Full Compass Systems is committed to your privacy and compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a new EU data privacy regulation that will go into effect May 25, 2018. The regulation is designed to give EU citizens more control over their data and to unify a number of existing privacy and security laws under one comprehensive law.
If you are a European resident, you have the right to access personal information Full Compass holds about you and to ask that your personal information be corrected, rectified, exported, updated, or deleted.
If you would like to exercise this right, please notify us through the contact information below.
We use collected information for the purpose of administering our business activities such as completing and tracking orders, customer service, administering giveaways and other promotions, customizing the shopping experience, troubleshooting, improving the website design and functionality, etc. From time to time, we may send you promotional messages by mail or email. You always have the ability to opt out of such communications.
How We Continue to Market to You
We employ a marketing technique called "remarketing," which allows third-party vendors, including Google, to show our ads on sites across the Internet. These vendors use cookies to place ads around the Internet based on a customer's visits to our Full Compass website. You can opt out of Google's use of cookies by visiting their Ad Settings. You can also opt out of all third-party vendors' use of cookies by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page.
How We Protect Your Information
In order to protect your information, we have put in place appropriate electronic, physical, and procedural safeguards. We utilize standard encryption and security technology to protect data transfer, and our information systems are treated with the highest regard for security. In addition, we limit access to customer information to only authorized personnel.
Your Order & Fraud Protection
In the event of a criminal investigation or suspected illegal activity, we may be required by law enforcement agencies to share certain personal information.
Because we are interested in protecting you from credit card fraud, all orders are subject to review by our fraud detection department. As part of this review we may require that your order ships to the billing address of your credit card or an authorized alternate address. We may also need to call or email you to further clarify any questions we may have.
The billing address of your card is the address that your monthly statement is mailed to. It is important that you provide us with this address correctly because we use it during our verification process.
If for some reason you cannot have your order shipped to your billing address, you may contact the card company and have them add an alternate authorized address to your account. We will be able to verify this address when we process your order.
Most banks will not allow an alternative address to be added to your debit card. If you need to have your order shipped to an alternative address we encourage you to not use a debit card.
Please feel free to call us if you need any special accommodations regarding your order and we will do our best to help you.
