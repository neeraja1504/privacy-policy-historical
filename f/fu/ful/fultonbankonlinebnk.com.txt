Cookies are used within the online banking login process to identify a user's computer to better enhance security. If a cookie is not on the computer or the user changes computers, the use will be asked to re-authenticate. This process helps add an additional level of security for our customers.

We use third party advertising and media companies to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet and to help manage and optimize our Internet business and communications. These networks use both cookie and pixel tag technology to measure the effectiveness of ads for their clients, none of which contain personally-identifiable information, during your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide information about goods and services that may be of particular interest to you. We limit these networks from using the information collected by these cookies and pixel tags for any purpose other than to assist us in our advertising efforts. From time to time, we may also share anonymous information with such third party companies in an aggregate form, for purposes of analysis and improvement of our Web site.

One such opt out program is available through the Network Advertising Initiative's Opt Out Tool. Please note that if you opt out, you may still receive online advertising from us or other online advertising networks. Opting out from a specific advertising network means only that the ads you do receive online will be generic and not based on your preferences or behavior.
