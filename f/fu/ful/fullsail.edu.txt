Anonymized and aggregated information is used for a variety of functions, including the measurement of visitors’ interest in and use of various portions or features of the Services.

For example, Full Sail allows you to provide information about your friends through our referral services, such as “Tell a Friend.” Our referral services may allow you to forward or share certain content with a friend or colleague, such as an email inviting your friend to use our Services. Email addresses that you may provide for a friend or colleague will be used to send your friend or colleague the content or link you request, but will not be collected or otherwise used by Full Sail or any other Third Parties for any other purpose.
Other Uses. Full Sail may use Personal Information for which we have a legitimate interest, such as direct marketing, individual or market research, anti-fraud protection, or any other purpose disclosed to you at the time you provide Personal Information or with your consent.
3.3 COOKIES, PIXEL TAGS/WEB BEACONS ANALYTICS INFORMATION, AND INTERNET-BASED ADVERTISING
We, as well as Third Parties that provide content, advertising, or other functionality on our Services, may use cookies, pixel tags, local storage, and other technologies (“Technologies”) to automatically collect information through the Services. We use Technologies that are essentially small data files placed on your computer, tablet, mobile phone, or other devices (referred to collectively as a "device") that allow us to record certain pieces of information whenever you visit or interact with our sites, services, applications, messaging, and tools, and to recognize you across devices.
Usage Tracking Information. Full Sail collects aggregated information regarding user traffic patterns mainly by tallying page views throughout the Sites and Mobile Apps ("Usage Tracking Information"). Full Sail does break down overall Usage Tracking Information according to a user’s domain name, browser type, IP address and MIME type by reading this information from the browser string (information contained in every user’s browser). Usage Tracking Information may also include the pages you were visiting before you came to our Sites or Mobile Apps, the time spent on those pages, search terms that you enter into our Search function, access times and dates, and other statistics. Nevertheless, we do not correlate Usage Tracking Information with data about individual users. We use Usage Tracking Information to determine which areas of our Sites and Mobile Apps that users visit based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build better Sites and Mobile Apps for you.
Pixel Tags. Full Sail works with multiple marketing partners to display retargeted ads to users of our Sites, on our behalf, across the Internet. They collect non-personally identifiable information about your visits to our Sites and your interaction with our products and Services. We collect non-personally identifiable information through the use of pixel tags, “clear GIFs,” and javascript-based tracking means, which are industry standard technologies that most major websites use. We collect no personally identifiable information during this process. A pixel tag (also known as a web beacon) is a piece of code embedded on the Site that collects information about users’ engagement on that web page. The use of a pixel allows us to record, for example, that a user has visited a particular web page or clicked on a particular advertisement.
Cookies. We may place a text file called a “cookie” in the browser files of your computer. The cookie itself contains no personally identifiable information although it will enable us to relate your use of the Sites to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided. But the only information a cookie can convey to us is information you supply yourself. A cookie cannot read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Full Sail uses cookies to track user traffic patterns (as described above). Our advertising system delivers a one-time cookie to better track ad impressions and click rates. You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you have set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use the Sites. Nevertheless, there may be certain portions of the Sites that can only be used if cookies are turned on. For example, cookies are necessary for a user to access portions of the Sites that require a valid user account.
Social Media Widgets. Our Sites includes social media features such as the Facebook “Like” button and LinkedIn (that might include widgets such as the share this button or other interactive mini-programs). These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. These social media features are either hosted by a Third Party or hosted directly on our Sites. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.
Our uses of such Technologies fall into the following general categories:
Operationally Necessary. We may use cookies, web beacons, or other similar technologies that are necessary to the operation of our Sites, Services, applications, and tools. This includes technologies that allow you access to our Sites, Services, applications, and tools; that are required to identify irregular Site behavior, prevent fraudulent activity and improve security; or that allow you to make use of our functions such as shopping-carts, saved search, or similar functions;
Performance Related. We may use cookies, web beacons, or other similar technologies to assess the performance of our Sites, applications, services, and tools, including as part of our analytic practices to help us understand how our visitors use our Sites, determine if you have interacted with our messaging, determine whether you have viewed an item or link, or to improve our Site content, applications, Services, or tools;
Functionality Related. We may use cookies, web beacons, or other similar technologies that allow us to offer you enhanced functionality when accessing or using our Sites, Services, applications, or tools. This may include identifying you when you sign into our Sites or keeping track of your specified preferences, interests, or past items viewed so that we may enhance the presentation of content on our Sites;
Advertising or Targeting Related. We may use first-party or Third Party cookies and web beacons to deliver content, including ads relevant to your interests, on our Sites or on Third Party sites. This includes using technologies to understand the usefulness to you of the advertisements and content that has been delivered to you, such as whether you have clicked on an advertisement.
We use Third-Party software development kits ( “SDKs” ) relating to advertising and/or to add functionality of our Services. Third-Party SDKs may allow Third Parties including advertisers to collect your personal information to provide content that is more relevant to you. You may opt out of tracking by emailing website@fullsail.com.
If you would like to opt out of the Technologies we employ on our Sites, Services, applications, or tools, you may do so by blocking, deleting, or disabling them as your browser or device permits.
3.4 LINKS TO OTHER SITES
The Sites may include links to other websites maintained or controlled by Third Parties unrelated to Full Sail. If you click on such a link, you will be directed to that Third Party’s website. The fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement or representation of our affiliation with that Third Party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over Third Party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personally identifiable information from you. Other websites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of personally identifiable information. We advise you to review the individual privacy policies of each external site that you use. Visiting these other websites or applications is at your own risk.
Full Sail’s Services may include publicly accessible blogs, community forums, or private messaging features. The Site and our other Services may also contain links and interactive features with various social media platforms (e.g., widgets). If you already use these platforms, their cookies may be set on your device when using our Site or other Services. You should be aware that Personal Information which you voluntarily include and transmit online in a publicly accessible blog, chat room, social media platform or otherwise online, or that you share in an open forum may be viewed and used by others without any restrictions. We are unable to control such uses of your information when interacting with a social media platform, and by using such services you assume the risk that the Personal Information provided by you may be viewed and used by third parties for any number of purposes.
3.5 THIRD-PARTY PAYMENT PROCESSING
We may sell merchandise through our Services. When you make purchases through the Services, we process your payments through a Third Party application, including the Apple App Store, Google Play App Store, Amazon App Store (together with any similar applications, “App Stores”) and Social Networking Sites (“SNS”) such as Facebook. The Third Party application may collect certain financial information from you to process a payment on behalf of Full Sail, including your name, email address, address and other billing information.

We may engage certain Third Party companies and individuals to facilitate the Sites, Mobile Apps and Services on our behalf, to perform Site and Mobile Apps-related services (e.g., without limitation, hosting and maintenance services, customer relationship services, web analytics, payment processing and database storage and management services). Full Sail also shares information about prospective students with Third Party services that Full Sail uses to evaluate potential applicants. We will share your Personal Information with these Third Parties, but only to the extent necessary to perform these functions and provide such services, and only if such Third Parties are obligated not to use or disclose your Personal Information for any other purpose.
Marketing – Internet Based Advertising and Third Party marketing. We may share aggregated information that includes your Personal Information, non-identifying information and Usage Tracking Information with Third Parties for industry analysis and demographic profiling and to deliver targeted advertising about other products and services. Through our Services, Full Sail may allow Third Party advertising partners to set tracking tools (e.g., cookies) to collect information regarding your activities (e.g., your IP address, page(s) visited, time of day). We may also share such de-identified information (such as demographic information and past purchase history) as well as selected Personal Information we have collected with Third Party advertising partners. These advertising partners may use this information (and similar information collected from other websites) for purposes of delivering targeted advertisements to you when you visit non-Full Sail related websites within their networks. This practice is commonly referred to as “interest-based advertising” or “online behavioral advertising. We may allow access to other data collected by the Sites to facilitate transmittal of information that may be useful, relevant, valuable or otherwise of interest to you. If you prefer that we do not share your Personal Information with Third Party advertising partners, you may opt out of such sharing at no cost by following the instructions in below.

Business Transfers. Full Sail may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your Personal Information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy. In such event, Full Sail will endeavor to direct the transferee to use Personal Information in a manner that is consistent with the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such Personal Information was collected.
4.2 INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS
Your information may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as where you live. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, we may transfer your Personal Information to the United States and process it there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.
5. OPT-OUT RIGHT (RIGHT TO OBJECT TO PROCESSING)

To opt-out of receiving messages from Full Sail via messaging apps (e.g., WhatsApp, Skype, and WeChat), please send the word “opt-out” to the Full Sail representative communicating with you. If you have any issues or questions, please contact us at website@fullsail.com.
5.2 MOBILE DEVICES
Full Sail may occasionally send you push notifications through our mobile applications with notices that may be of interest to you. You may at any time opt out from receiving these types of communications by changing the settings on your mobile device. Full Sail may also collect location-based information if you use our Mobile Apps. You may opt out of this collection by changing the settings on your mobile device.
5.3 COOKIES AND INTEREST-BASED ADVERTISING
As noted above, you may stop or restrict the placement of cookies on your computer or remove them from your browser by adjusting your web browser preferences. Please note that cookie-based opt outs are not effective on mobile applications. However, on many mobile devices, application users may opt out of certain mobile ads via their device settings.
The online advertising industry also provides websites from which you may opt out of receiving targeted ads from our data partners and our other advertising partners that participate in self-regulatory programs. You can access these, and also learn more about targeted advertising and consumer choice and privacy, at www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp, or www.youronlinechoices.eu and www.aboutads.info/choices. You can also choose not to be included in Google Analytics here.
Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. Please note that we do not respond to or honor DNT signals or similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers.
To be clear, whether you are using our opt out or an online industry opt out, these cookie-based opt outs must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted out. For example, if you have opted out on your computer browser, that opt out will not be effective on your mobile device. You must separately opt out on each device. Advertisements on Third Party websites that contain the AdChoices link and that link to this Privacy Policy may have been directed to you based on anonymous, non-Personal Information collected by advertising partners over time and across websites. These advertisements provide a mechanism to opt out of the advertising partners’ use of this information for interest-based advertising purposes.
6. RIGHTS OF ACCESS, RECTIFICATION, ERASURE AND RESTRICTION
You may inquire as to whether Full Sail is Processing Personal Information about you, request access to Personal Information, and ask that we correct, amend or delete your Personal Information where it is inaccurate. Where otherwise permitted by applicable law, you may send an e-mail to website@fullsail.com or use any of the methods set out in this Privacy Policy to request access to, receive (port), seek rectification, or request erasure of Personal Information held about you by Full Sail. Please include your full name, email address associated with your account, and a detailed description of your data request. Such requests will be processed in line with local laws.
Although we make good faith efforts to provide Individuals with access to their Personal Information, there may be circumstances in which Full Sail is unable to provide access, including but not limited to: where the information contains legal privilege, would compromise others’ privacy or other legitimate rights, where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the Individual’s privacy in the case in question or where it is commercially proprietary. If Full Sail determines that access should be restricted in any particular instance, we will provide you with an explanation of why that determination has been made and a contact point for any further inquiries. To protect your privacy, Full Sail will take commercially reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access to or making any changes to your Personal Information.
7. DATA RETENTION
Full Sail retains the Personal Information we receive as described in this Privacy Policy for as long as you use our Services or as necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected, provide our Services, resolve disputes, establish legal defenses, conduct audits, pursue legitimate business purposes, enforce our agreements, and comply with applicable laws.
8. SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION
The security of your Personal Information is important to us. But remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, and we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you provide to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number or social security number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). In some cases, we also encrypt sensitive information where it is stored on our systems. We do not accept liability for unintentional disclosure.
By using the Sites or providing Personal Information to us, you agree that we may communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of the Sites. If we learn of a security system’s breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically by posting a notice on the Sites or sending an e-mail to you. You may have a legal right to receive this notice in writing.
8.1 PHISHING
Identity theft and the practice currently known as “phishing” are of great concern to Full Sail. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your login information, or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication. For more information about phishing, visit the Federal Trade Commission’s website.
