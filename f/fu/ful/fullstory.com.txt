Because we respect your right to privacy, we provide you with a nice user interface you can use to opt out of our use of some types of cookies. In our Privacy Preference Centre, you can click on the different category headings to find out more and change our default cookie settings. However, blocking some types of cookies may impact your experience of the site and the services we are able to offer.

B. Information collected for FullStory Customers
This section applies to Personal Information of FullStory Customers that we may process via provision of the FullStory Services. If you are not a Customer, please refer to either the FullStory Visitors or the FullStory Users section of this policy.
We use FullStory on FullStory. In this regard, we use a separate instance of the FullStory Services to monitor the instance of FullStory Services that our customers use. This includes using first-party cookies to maintain a coherent scope for a customer user session across the customer-facing FullStory Services. In addition, the customer-facing FullStory Services may use third-party cookies to aid in payment processing.
If you are a Customer of FullStory, when you signed up for the Services, you entered into an agreement with FullStory to accept FullStory’s terms of use for the Services, which includes the obligations in this Privacy Policy and our Acceptable Use Policy (the “Agreement”). As part of your use of the Services, we collect the same information as that of a Visitor (see above) through your interaction with the Site, and we may ask you for additional information, such as payment information, Usage Data in relation to the Services, and other information we deem relevant for the purpose of providing the Services.
FullStory may use Customers’ Personal Information as agreed to in the Agreement and:
To complete transactions between you and FullStory,

To enhance or improve user experience, the Site, or FullStory Services,

C. Information collected when visiting websites that use FullStory Services
This section applies to Personal Information FullStory may process relating to Users of a FullStory Customer’s website.
For Users of a FullStory Customer, FullStory is acting as a service provider to the Customer for the FullStory Services. FullStory collects information on a User under the direction of its Customer, and has no direct relationship with the User whose information it processes. It is important to understand that when a User visits other websites that use the FullStory Services, the FullStory Customer’s privacy policy applies to that information collected instead of this Privacy Policy.
FullStory Services use first-party cookies and local storage to maintain a coherent scope for a user session across multiple pages on a single website.
FullStory Services do not and will not ever attempt to identify the same person across disparate, unrelated domains. FullStory takes pains in its engineering choices to differentiate itself from ad-tracking software. It is a violation of our Acceptable Use Policy for our customers to attempt to build multi-site user profiles for the intent of selling or exchanging lists of users or demographic information.
General Information on our use of Personal Information
We will never sell your data to third parties or otherwise share it with non-agent third parties. If this practice should change in the future we will update this policy to identify those parties and illustrate how individuals can exercise their right to opt out of such usage. However, in the course of business, we may hire third party individuals and organizations to help us make the FullStory Services better. These third parties include our web host provider, SaaS providers such as email hosting services, payment processors, or outside contractors we hire to perform marketing, maintenance, or assist us in securing our website. We may also hire third parties to operate, maintain, repair, or otherwise improve or preserve our website or its underlying files or systems.
FullStory may disclose Personal Information only to those of its employees and third-party organizations that (1) need to know such information in order to process it on FullStory’s behalf or to provide services as described above, and (2) have agreed not to disclose it to any other parties without FullStory’s consent. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using the Site and/or the Service, you consent to the transfer of information to such individuals and organizations in order to accomplish these purposes.
If you are a registered user of the Service and have supplied your email address, FullStory may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with FullStory and our products. FullStory will only send you marketing communications, including via email, in compliance with applicable laws and in accordance with your preferences, that we believe may be of interest to you. FullStory takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction of Personal Information. To the extent we send you this type of email in compliance with applicable laws and in accordance with your preferences, you can opt-out at any time by either following the opt-out instructions in the email or just replying to tell us you don’t want to receive any additional emails.
In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the transferred business assets. If we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, User and Visitor information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Site of any change in ownership or uses of your Personal Information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your Personal Information.
Opting out of FullStory Services
If you wish to prevent all websites using the FullStory Services to be able to record activity, you can opt-out of the FullStory Services. Opting out will create a cookie that tells FullStory to turn off recording on any site which uses the FullStory Services. The presence of this cookie is required to continue opting out. That means if you clear your browser cookies, you will have to opt-out again. Unfortunately, this is the most permanent and least intrusive solution FullStory can offer because of how browser technology works. You may wish to employ a third party browser extension to block scripts like FullStory instead of using our Opt Out cookie, but know that using any third party extension may pose additional risk.
One More thing about FullStory Services
If you are considering opting-out, it's probably a good time to make sure you really understand that the purpose of the FullStory Services is to help well-intentioned companies make their website better for you. It is emphatically not one of those we-track-you-around-the-web kind of deals. We think that's creepy, too.
Most people who make websites are just like you: nice people who want to do a good job and make something awesome. And you wouldn't believe how much time and energy product teams spend trying to make their websites great for you. Without the FullStory Services, though, they simply do not have enough information to understand when they get it wrong. If they can see how you actually experience their website, like an ongoing usability study, they'll actually know what to improve! They don't need to record anything sensitive in order to do that, and we have a strict Acceptable Use Policy where you can see for yourself the high standards we expect of FullStory customers with respect to your privacy.
Blocking Cookies on the FullStory Services
If you choose, you can set your browser to reject cookies or you can manually delete individual cookies or all of the cookies on your computer by following your browser’s help file directions. Note that turning off cookies may also disable functions of many websites you visit. If your browser is set to reject cookies or you manually delete cookies, FullStory will not be able to coalesce your anonymous user identity automatically into sessions across pages on the same website.
Release of Your Information for Legal Purposes
We may access or release Personal Information about you when required to do so in order to comply with any applicable, laws, regulations, subpoenas, or enforceable governmental or public authority requests, including, to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. We may also access or release Personal Information when we have a good faith belief that such access or release is reasonably necessary to (i) enforce applicable terms of service, including investigation of potential violations, (ii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues, (iii) respond to user support requests, or (iv) protect our rights, property or safety, our users and the public. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection, spam/malware prevention, and security forensics.

We attempt to notify Users about legal demands for their personal data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency.

We may disclose your Personal Information in the event of a business transfer.

Privacy Rights Specific to California Residents
Under the California Consumer Privacy Act, California residents have specific rights regarding their personal information. This section describes Californians’ rights and explains how California residents can exercise those rights.
Below we further outline specific rights which California residents may have under the California Consumer Privacy Act.

The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.
Right to Data Portability. You have the right to a “portable” copy of your Personal Information that you have submitted to us.

Where this is the case, we will inform you of specific details in response to your request. We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service providers to:
