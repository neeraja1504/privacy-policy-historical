Funny Car Games
Website Visitors
Like most website operators, Funny Car Games collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Funny Car Games’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Funny Car Games’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Funny Car Games may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
Funny Car Games also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Funny Car Games does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to Funny Car Games's websites choose to interact with Funny Car Games in ways that require Funny Car Games to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Funny Car Games gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a forum at funnycargames.com to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Funny Car Games are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Funny Car Games collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Funny Car Games. Funny Car Games does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities. Funny Car Games does not keep a copy of any credit card information once a transaction is complete.

If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Funny Car Games takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
