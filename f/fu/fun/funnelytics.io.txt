We value your privacy and are committed to protecting the personal information of our users. We have adopted this Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) to be clear about the data we collect, why we collect it, whom we share it with, how you can access it, and correct it when necessary.
We have always safeguarded your Personal Information and recognize our duty to handle your data in a responsible manner. We do not and will not sell your data to third parties.
This Policy applies to the use of the https://funnelytics.io website, which includes the Funnelytics web application (the “Service”). Please read it carefully in order to understand when you may provide Personal information to us and how Funnelytics uses the Personal Information provided. By using our Service, you agree to the use of your personal information as described in this Policy. The terms “we”, “us” or “Funnelytics” are each intended as a reference to Funnelytics inc.
To make this Policy as clear as possible, we have determined the occasions when a customer would potentially share Personal Information with Funnelytics. The Policy is therefore divided as follows:
