Through some social networking sites’ privacy settings, you can control what data you share. For more information about how social networking sites handle your personal information, please refer to their privacy policies and terms of use.
We, our service providers, advertisers, advertising networks and platforms, agencies, and partners may collect various types of non-personally identifiable information when you visit the Funny Life Sites. The information may be collected via cookies, log files, and web beacons (aka “clear GIFs”).
Cookies are text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters that are placed in your computer’s browser. Cookies do not contain personally identifiable information. However, once you choose to furnish a Site with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Funny Life Sites may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.
Log files automatically record certain information that your web browser sends whenever you visit any website (“Server Logs”). These Server Logs may include your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, browser language, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time of your visit, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
Web beacons are small pieces of code placed on a web page to monitor the behavior of and collect data about the visitors viewing a web page. For example, web beacons may be used to count the users who visit a web page or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a visitor viewing that page.
How We Use the Information
We will not use your personally identifiable information to send marketing messages to you without your consent or as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may, however, use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as such as to notify you when you have won one of our contests or when we make changes to our terms of service, to fulfill a request by you for an online newsletter, or to contact you about your account with us). We may use web beacons in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened.
The information we collect in connection with our online forums and communities is used to provide an interactive experience.

You can choose not to provide us with any or all of the information we specify or request, but then you may not be able to register with us or to take advantage of some or all of our features.
The Funny Life Sites include and run social media features, buttons and widgets. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.

Analytics and Third Party Advertising
We may use the services of reputable third parties to provide us with data collection, reporting, ad response measurement, and Site analytics, and to also assist us with delivery of relevant marketing messages and advertisements. These third parties may view, edit, or set their own cookies. The use of such technologies by these third parties is subject to their own privacy policies and is not covered by this privacy notice.
Advertising enables us to provide you with the content for which we are known. Our goal is to deliver advertising that is relevant to you. As part of this process we, our third party service providers, advertisers, advertising networks and platforms, agencies, or our partners may collect information about your online activities across the Funny Life Sites and other sites, and supplement such information with information from third parties, in an effort to make inferences about your interests and deliver to you advertisements targeted to those interests.
We may use reputable third-party audience data such as age, gender and interests to better understanding the behavior of our visitors and work with companies that collect information about your online activities to provide advertising targeted to suit your interests and preferences. For example, you may see certain ads on the Funny Life Sites or other reputable third party websites to target our ads based on information we or they have collected, including information that was collected through automated means (such as cookies and web beacons). These companies also use automated technologies to collect information when you click on our ads, which helps track and manage the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.
We offer you choices with regard to these interest-based ads. To learn more about interest-based ads and the choices available to you, please visit our AdChoices page.
At this time, the Funny Life Sites do not recognize automated browser signals regarding tracking mechanisms, which may include “do not track” instructions. However, you can change your privacy preferences regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies through your browser. Please consult the “Help” section of your browser for more information.
Our Commitment to Security
We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, to maintain data security, and to use correctly the information we collect online. However, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this privacy notice.
Our Commitment To Childrens’ Privacy
