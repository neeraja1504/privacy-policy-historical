Cookies and Web Beacons
We use third party advertisements on funwithmama.com to support our site. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed.

Fun With Mama accepts sponsorships, paid advertisements and other forms of compensation.
Sponsored posts:  A sponsored post is a blog post written in exchange of compensation for writing about a product. However, all opinions and thoughts are true and honest. This compensation may influence the content of posts but never my honest opinion. I will only recommend products that I have tried, tested and used myself (unless otherwise noted). These posts will be clearly noted.
The views and opinions expressed on this blog are purely mine and my children’s experiences. Any product claim, statistic, quote or other representation about a product or service should be verified with the manufacturer, provider or party in question.
What this all means is that I will only recommend products that I believe are wonderful and I will give you my fair evaluation.
Amazon Affiliates:  We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. This program provides blogs like myself with compensation for advertising for Amazon.com and for linking to Amazon.com products when appropriate in a post. Having an Amazon.com link in a post does not influence my feelings on that product and all opinions stated remain my own.  Amazon, as a third party, also uses cookies to track their advertising on my site and their links. You are welcome to read more about the Amazon Affiliates program in their Operating Agreement.
Parental supervision: Please note that parental (or teacher) supervision is required for ALL activities posted on Fun With Mama.
This disclosure policy is subject to change without notice. If you have any questions please e-mail me at nadia at funwithmama.com
