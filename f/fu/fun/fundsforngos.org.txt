Non-Personal Information We Collect by Automated Means And How We Use It: We collect certain information by automated means when you visit the Website.  In addition, we also use Google Analytics and StateCounter.com – both  third-party tracking services – to collect such information.  The information collected may include usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of users to the Website, pages visited and similar data. If gathered, this this data is used in the aggregate, and not in a manner that is intended to identify you personally. This type of aggregate information may be shared with third parties at any time.  In addition to the third-party tracking services mentioned above, we also collect this information through various other means, including “cookies,” “web beacons” and IP addresses, as further explained below.
Cookies – A cookie is a piece of information that a web server may place on your computer when you visit a website. Cookies are commonly used by websites to improve the user experience.  Many cookies last only through a single website session, or visit. Others may have an expiration date, or may remain on your computer until you delete them. FundsforNGOs uses “session cookies” in order to enhance the user experience and for other website related purposes.  These session cookies are not linked to personally identifiable information.  We may also use cookies for other purposes, including to maintain continuity during a user session, to gather data about the usage of our website for research and other purposes, or to store a user name or related login credentials so that you do not have to provide this information every time you return to our Website. Most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new cookie, and how to disable existing cookies. Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to take full advantage of all the features on our Website. Our cookies do not gather personally identifiable information. In some cases, FundsforNGOs may also use another company to operate web servers for our Website.  FundsforNGOs uses the cookie information gathered by these companies in the same manner as stated in this Privacy Policy.
Web Beacons – Certain pages on the Website contain “web beacons” (also know as Internet tags, pixel tags and clear GIFs). These web beacons allow third parties to obtain information such as the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the beacon appears, the time the page containing the beacon was viewed, the type of browser used to view the page, and the information in cookies set by the third party. Web beacons also may be used to track whether you have opened an HTML email. When the email is opened, a part of the code that makes up the HTML page calls a web server to load the web beacon that then generates a record showing that the email has been viewed. Web beacons may also recognize when the email was opened, how many times it was forwarded and which URLs (links within the email) were clicked.
IP Addresses – When you visit and interact with the Website, FundsforNGOs and third parties with whom we have contracted to provide services for us may collect Internet Protocol addresses (each an “IP Address”), as well as browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and page navigation. An IP Address is a unique identifier number that certain electronic devices use to identify and to communicate with each other on the Internet; your Internet Service Provider automatically assigns an IP Address to the computer that you are using.  We gather this information to track website visitor movement in the aggregate, and to gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. Our goal in gathering this information is to learn how our customers and the public are using our service. We may use this information to enhance our Website or for other lawful purposes.
