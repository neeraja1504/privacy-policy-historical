We do not currently require you to provide Personal Information in order to have access to general information available on the Site. But, we do receive and/or collect Personal Information from you in the following ways:
4.1. Account. In order to participate in the Service, you are required to create an account ("Account"). We may offer different options to create an Account, including:
(a) Online Registration Form : You may choose to complete and submit an online registration form. You will be asked to provide us with a business email address and a password that you will use for your Account.
(b) Third Party Accounts : You may choose to create (or supplement) an Account by clicking on a 'connect' or 'sign on' button that we may display on the Site for a designated account that you have with a third party website or service (each a "Third Party Account"), such as Intuit's QuickBooks, FreshBooks, Xero, or another third party e-invoicing or accounting software product that is designated on our Site. Doing so will enable you to link your Fundbox Service Account and your Third Party Account. If you choose this option, then we will obtain certain information, including Personal Information, from your Third Party Account. The information that we obtain from your Third Party Account is information that you have chosen to make available to us as part of your use of your Third Party Account, and is typically identified in the privacy policy of your Third Party Account provider. You acknowledge and agree to review and be bound by the terms of use and privacy policy of the provider of your Third Party Account. Please note that in order to use this option, you will need to have, and may need to be signed-in to, an existing Third Party Account.
Regardless of which method you choose to register your Account, we may send an email to your nominated email address, or to the email address that you have designated in your Third Party Account, to instruct you how to confirm your registration.
