Privacy Policy - Fun Punching
Privacy Policy:
Fun Punching (" Fun Punching ") operates FunPunching.com and may operate other websites. It is FunPunching's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.
Website Visitors
Like most website operators, Fun Punching collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. FunPunching's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how FunPunching's visitors use its website. From time to time, Fun Punching may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
Fun Punching also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on FunPunching.com blogs/sites. Fun Punching only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog/site where the comment was left.
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to FunPunching's websites choose to interact with Fun Punching in ways that require Fun Punching to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Fun Punching gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up at FunPunching.com to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Fun Punching are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Fun Punching collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Fun Punching. Fun Punching does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
Aggregated Statistics
Fun Punching may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. Fun Punching may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Fun Punching does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
Fun Punching discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on FunPunching's behalf or to provide services available at FunPunching's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using FunPunching's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Fun Punching will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Fun Punching discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Fun Punching believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Fun Punching, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Fun Punching website and have supplied your email address, Fun Punching may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Fun Punching and our products. If you send us a request (for example via email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Fun Punching takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
