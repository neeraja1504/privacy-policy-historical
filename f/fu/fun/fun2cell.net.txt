Some jurisdictions do not allow us to send text message advertisements without your express consent, so the foregoing may not apply to you.
If you would like to opt-out of our sharing your personal information with those third party marketers and business partners for marketing purposes, indicate that we may not do so at the point where you give us such personal information. If you change your mind later, you can send an e-mail to the address as stated to you on the Sites and/or through our Services.
