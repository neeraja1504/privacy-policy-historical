GDPR & Your DataFunky Junk Interiors
.
Hey, hi!
So, there are a bunch of new data privacy rules that have come into play if you are a visitor that requires GDPR compliance as of May 25, 2018.
If you are in the USA or Canada, this doesn’t apply to you. Sorry for all the extra hoopla.
However, my message below is indeed applicable to anyone…
Any info you leave on this site is only used to perform the tasks you request it to. I protect your info under password protection, and keep ONLY what is absolutely required to perform the tasks you wish to perform, so your reader experience is a good one.
And you only get what you ask for. So for instance, if you want to sign up for an emailed blog post update because you just want the emailed blog post update, that’s what you’ll get. Everything involved is spelled out before you click SUBMIT so you can make an informed choice.
Thank-you for your visits, email subscriptions (and optional un-subscriptions too), comments, linkups to weekend DIY parties, and for trusting this site to respect and take good care of your info.
If that’s all you need, we’re good. Really, nothing has changed over here other than a whole bunch more words added so you’re more aware how what is being used how. Email me at donna@funkyjunkinteriors.net if you require help.
So let’s go have some DIY fun!
For those that wish to hear all the more legal nitty gritty details, it’s all below…
