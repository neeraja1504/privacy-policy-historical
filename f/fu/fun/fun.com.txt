How We Use Website Analytics Data
We have implemented Google Analytics, Google Display Advertising, and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting on our website to help us understand how visitors use our services. These tools use cookies to gather standard Internet log information and user behavior information in an anonymous form. The information created by the cookie about your use of the website is transmitted to Google and is then used to evaluate visitors' use of the website and to compile aggregate statistical reports on website activity for our site specifically. We have followed Google's best practice for IP Anonymization to ensure that no personally-identifiable information will be sent to Google Analytics. See here for more detail.
We will never (nor will we allow any third-party to) use the statistical analytics tool to track or to collect any Personal Information of visitors to our website. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google, nor will Google link, or seek to link, an IP address with the identity of a computer user. We will not associate any data gathered from this site with any Personal Information from any source, unless you explicitly submit that information via a fill-in form on our website.
If you would like to opt out of being tracked using Google Analytics on any website, then simply head over to Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on and install the add-on in your browsers.
How We Use Cookies, Tracking Data, and Advertising
We use cookies to keep track of user shopping carts, to remember our user's preferences (e.g. language and country preference), and for security/login authentication. These cookies are required in order for our website to function correctly and for you to place an order.
The third-party analytics platforms that we use on our website may set cookies on your computer. We utilize these technologies to analyze shopping and buying trends, to track users' interactions with the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole in order to provide an optimized shopping experience and relevant product recommendations. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis. These cookies are optional; our website will function and you can place an order, though the content you see on the website may not be as relevant.
Our third-party advertising partners may use technologies such as cookies or beacons to gather information about your activities on our website. This information is used when you leave our website and visit a site that uses the same advertising partner. That website will then display product advertising to you based upon your browsing activities and interests while you were on our website. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking here. Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads. You will continue to receive generic ads.
The Social Media features and widgets on our website are hosted by a third-party and may use cookies or beacons. These third-party cookies are set by the individual Social Media service and are used to provide the functionality of the feature as well as collect any additional tracking data. Please note that we do not send your personal information to these Social Media widgets, but they still have access to your web browsing information such as browser, operating system, and IP address. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.
Your browser may give you the ability to control the cookies that are set on your computer.

Our website includes links to other websites whose privacy practices may differ from those of the websites owned by Fun.com, Inc. If you submit personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy policy. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any website you visit.
Additional Disclosure
We may also disclose your personal information
as required by law such as to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process, or respond to a government request,
when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or in the case of possible criminal acts or security threats,
if Fun.com, Inc. is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information,

Security
We take security seriously, and the security of your personal data is important to us. When we collect personal information directly from you, we follow industry-standard practices to protect the data, both during transmission and once we receive it – including full-site SSL. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our website, you can contact us.
We provide two means for you to make a purchase on our site. You can either use our order form or a third-party payment option (PayPal; Amazon Pay; Sezzle). If you use our shopping cart, the transmission of sensitive information (such as credit card information) collected on our order form is encrypted using secure socket layer technology (SSL). If you choose to use a third-party payment option to pay for your order, its privacy policy and security practices will apply to your information. We encourage you to read that privacy policy before providing your information.
In the event of a data breach, we have a protocol in place for handling the breach and notifying customers and the supervisory authority. We do not store any credit card information when your card is authorized during checkout, so there isn't a chance of your card information being stolen in a data breach after your order is placed.
Data Retention
We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services, please contact us. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements.
We also collect and maintain aggregated, anonymized information which we may retain indefinitely to protect the safety and security of our website, improve our services, or comply with legal obligations.

Children’s Online Privacy
Our website is not marketed to, nor do we knowingly collect or store personal information from anyone under the age of 13. If we learn that we have collected or received personal information from a child under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under the age of 13, please contact us immediately.
European Union Residents
At Fun.com, Inc. we take your privacy seriously and have taken steps to comply with the requirements defined in the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that goes into effect on May 25th, 2018. Many of the requirements are outlined in different areas of this Privacy Policy, but this section highlights items that are unique or specific to our European audience.
Lawful Basis
Data protection law in Europe requires a lawful basis for collecting and retaining personal information from citizens or residents of the European Economic Area. Our lawful bases include:
Contract: in order to fulfil the contract we have with you to provide the product/service that you requested, we need to use your personal data to charge your payment and to ship goods to you.
Legal obligation: we may need your data to comply with customs requests or to maintain tax audit records.
Legitimate interests: we have a good and fair reason to use your data in ways that are reasonably expected as part of running our business and that do not materially impact your rights, freedom, or interests. For example, we use identity, device, and location information to prevent fraud and to keep our services secure. And we analyze how users interact with our website so that we can better understand which features and design elements are working well and which are not working.
Your Choices: Data Access, Correction, Deletion, and Portability
We provide you with reasonable access to the personal data that you may have provided through your use of our services. If you wish to access, modify, delete, or obtain a copy of your information, you may do so at any time by logging in to the My Account section of our website to make changes, or by clicking on the Manage Preferences link in any email we've sent you to modify your preferences. Alternatively, you may contact us via email or live chat, or by phone or mail using the options listed in the Contact Information section of this privacy policy, and we will be happy to help you.
Please note that while any changes you make will be reflected in the active user database instantly, we may retail some information for backups, archiving, prevention of fraud and abuse, analytics, satisfaction of legal obligations, for audit and compliance records, or where we otherwise reasonably believe that we have a legitimate reason to do so.
Your Rights: Restricting Processing and Objection
At any time prior to us shipping out your order, you may withdraw your consent to process your data by contacting us and we will cancel your order. Once an order has shipped we are unable to cancel the processing of your data, but you have the same right to access, correct, delete, or obtain a copy of your data at any time using our self-service tools or by contacting us. Additionally, you have the ability to opt-out from all performance, social media, and advertising cookies on our website by using the Cookie Settings link on the bottom of all pages of our website.
At any time, you may object to the processing of your personal data, on legitimate grounds, except if otherwise permitted by applicable law. In most cases you are able to control these settings through our self-service tools, but as always you may contact us via email or live chat, or by phone or mail using the options listed in the Contact Information section of this privacy policy, and we will be happy to help you.
