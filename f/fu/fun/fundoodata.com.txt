Your Information:
Subscribers and Visitors
In order to process your request, we need to know contact information such as your full name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, job and job title, and method of payment. All of this information is not shared with third parties, except for: 1) special promotions of FundooData's or its partners you have requested to be shown; 2) where a third party performs services on behalf of FundooData's and has agreed to keep such information confidential; 3) the aggregate use of the information of multiple FundooData's subscribers and visitors where individual personal information is not disclosed; and 4) advertising promotions. FundooData's shares Web site usage information about subscribers and visitors with a third-party advertising company for the purpose of targeting advertising campaigns and upgrading visitor information used in reporting statistics. For this purpose, some of the pages you visit on our Web site use pixel tags (also called clear gifs). FundooData's also uses your information to market its services and to gain feedback on potential new services.
Newsletters
As a subscriber or visitor to a FundooData's site, you may voluntarily sign up for one of our free newsletters. When you sign up for one of the newsletters, we ask for contact information, such as your name and e-mail address, and job and job title information, which are used to help us understand our audience. This information is for FundooData's use only and is not disclosed to any other party except in aggregate form. Additionally, if you decide that you do not wish to receive a newsletter or update any longer, you may cancel it.
Surveys
Surveys are another method by which we gather information about our FundooData's Online visitors. From time to time, we request subscribers' or newsletter subscribers' input in order to evaluate potential features and services. The decision to answer a survey is completely yours. We use information gathered from surveys to improve our service.
How Do We Protect Subscriber Information Once We Have It?
