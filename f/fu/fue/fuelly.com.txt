IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO SUCH TERMS, EXIT THIS PAGE AND DO NOT ACCESS OR USE THE FUELLY SERVICE.
We are committed to respect and protect the privacy of the personal information we obtain from you through the Fuelly Service and we have created this Privacy Policy to inform you about how we collect, use and share your personal information, and about our privacy practices in general.
We are always ready to address your questions and concerns regarding this policy and our privacy practices. If you would like to contact customer service, please contact us via www.fuelly.com.
We continually strive to find new ways to enhance your experience with the Fuelly Service and we may modify this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our privacy practices. You are encouraged to review this Privacy Policy periodically and to check the “Last Updated” date at the top of the Privacy Policy for the most recent version.

Terms of Service. Use of the Fuelly Service is subject to the terms of our Terms of Service found at www.fuelly.com/privacy, which is hereby incorporated and made part of this Privacy Policy. By using the Fuelly Service, you agree to be bound by our Terms of Service.
Types and Uses of Collected Information. Fuelly collects two types of information about you:
Personally Identifiable Information. Personally Identifiable Information is information that identifies a specific person. When you engage in certain activities via the Fuelly Service, including but not limited to creating an account, sending feedback, or otherwise participating in the Fuelly Service (collectively, “Identification Activities”), we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself. If you elect to engage in an Identification Activity, however, we may ask you to provide us with certain personal information about yourself, such as your name, address (including zip code), email address and/or telephone number. When you enroll in the Fuelly Service, we may also ask you to provide us with additional information, such as credit card information. Depending on the Identification Activity, some of the information we ask you to provide may be identified as mandatory and some identified as voluntary. If you do not provide mandatory information for a particular Identification Activity, you will not be permitted to engage in that Identification Activity with the Fuelly Service. Depending on the Identification Activity, Fuelly may not re-ask you for Personally Identifiable Information if such are already stored with us.
When you use the Fuelly Service, we may use GPS technology (or other similar geolocation technology) to determine your current location in order to display a location map with relevant content or otherwise provide for the transmission of data, including such data for any required or optional features of the Fuelly Service. If you do not want us to use your location for the purposes set forth above, you should turn off the location services for the Fuelly Service located in your account settings or in your mobile phone settings and/or within the Fuelly Service, provided that this may make certain or all features of the Fuelly Service inoperable.
We may use Personally Identifiable Information to provide products and/or services to you, administer sweepstakes and contests, enhance the operation of the Fuelly Service, improve our marketing and promotional efforts, analyze use of the Fuelly Service, improve the Fuelly Service, and tailor your experience with third parties as provided below in this Privacy Policy. We may also use Personally Identifiable Information to troubleshoot, resolve disputes, accomplish administrative tasks, contact you, enforce our agreements with you, including our Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities.
2. **Non-Personally Identifiable Information.** Non-Personally Identifiable Information is information that does not identify a specific person. This type of information may include things like the Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”) of the website you visited before coming to the Fuelly Service or otherwise participating in the Fuelly Service, the URL of the website you visit after leaving the Fuelly Service, the type of browser you are using, your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, mobile carrier information, mobile device information, or general and/or aggregated location data that does constitute Personally Identifiable Information. We, and/or our authorized Third Party Service Providers, may automatically collect this information when you visit or use the Fuelly Service through the use of electronic tools like Cookies and Web beacons or Pixel tags, as described below in this Privacy Policy. Most of the other information we collect for mobile, such as your mobile device identification and mobile device type, the request type, your mobile carrier, your mobile carrier user identification, and the content of your request, does not by itself identify you to Fuelly, though it may be unique or consist of or contain information that you consider personal.
We use Non-Personally Identifiable Information to troubleshoot, administer the Fuelly Service, analyze trends, gather demographic information, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities. We may also share this information with our authorized Third Party Service Providers to measure the overall effectiveness of our products and services.
Release of Personally Identifiable Information. We will not sell or share your Personally Identifiable Information with other parties except as provided below:
Authorized Third Party Service Providers. Fuelly may provide products and services through third parties. These “Third Party Service Providers” perform functions on our or your behalf. You or We may share your Personally Identifiable Information with such Third Party Service Providers to fulfill orders, move data in or out of the Fuelly Service, analyze data, operate the Fuelly Service, troubleshoot and provide customer service. We may also provide personal information to individuals and companies with whom we have business relationships and may share your information with Third Party Service Providers to accomplish our administrative tasks. However, the use of your Personally Identifiable Information by such parties is governed by the privacy policies of such parties and is not subject to our control.
Remarketing. Remarketing is a way for us to connect with people, based upon your past interactions with the Fuelly Service. Third-party marketing vendors may be hired by Fuelly to perform remarketing services. As a result, third-party vendors, including Google, may show Fuelly ads on sites on the Internet. Third-party vendors may use cookies to serve ads based on a user’s prior visits to the Fuelly Service. Users may opt out of Google’s use of cookies by visiting the Google advertising opt-out page at http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html.
Acquisition. As with any other company, we could merge with, or be acquired by another company. If this occurs, the successor company would acquire the information we maintain, including Personally Identifiable Information. However, Personally Identifiable Information would remain subject to this Privacy Policy.
As required by law. We reserve the right to disclose your Personally Identifiable Information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on us, enforce or apply this Privacy Policy, Terms of Service or other agreements or protect the rights, property or safety of the Fuelly Service, users of the Fuelly Service or others.
Release of Non-Personally Identifiable Information. We may disclose or share Non-Personally Identifiable Information with Third Party Service Providers and the general public. For example, we may share aggregated demographic information (which does not include any Personally Identifiable Information) or use Third Party Service Providers to track and analyze Non-Personally Identifiable usage and volume statistical information from our users to administer the Fuelly Service. We may also publish this aggregated information for promotional purposes. Such data is collected on our behalf, and is owned and used by us.
We may use Third Party Service Providers to serve ads when you participate in the Fuelly Service. These companies may use Non-Personally Identifiable Information about your visits and use of the Fuelly Service, and visits to other websites or locations in order to provide, through the use of network tags, advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you.
Updating Information. If you are enrolled in the Fuelly Service, you may change any of your Personally Identifiable Information by logging into your account and accessing the www.fuelly.com/driver/[your username]. We encourage you to promptly update your Personally Identifiable Information if it changes, as out-of-date Personally Identifiable Information may negatively affect the quality of your Fuelly Service experience.
Choices on Collection/Use of Information. You can always choose not to provide certain information, although a certain level of information is required to engage and participate in the Fuelly Service. You cannot opt-out of Administrative Emails. “Administrative Emails” relate to your activity on the Fuelly Service, and include but are not limited to emails regarding your account, requests or inquiries, and purchases of products and services. If you do not want to receive promotional emails from us, you may elect to opt-out of receiving promotional emails at any time after registering by e-mailing us at support@fuelly.com or by hitting the “unsubscribe” button at the bottom of any of our e-mails.
Security of Information. You can access your Personally Identifiable Information via the Fuelly Service with your password and username. This password is encrypted. We advise against sharing your password with anyone. If you access your account via a third-party site or service, you may have additional or different sign-in protections via that third-party site or service. You need to prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password and/or other sign-in mechanism appropriately and limiting access to your computer, browser, or mobile device by signing off after you have finished accessing your account. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time. In the event that we believe that the security of your information may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development. In addition, your Personally Identifiable Information resides on a secure server that only selected personnel and contractors have access to. We may encrypt certain sensitive information using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to ensure that your Personally Identifiable Information is safe as it is transmitted to us. However, no data transmission can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we employ commercially reasonable security measures to protect data and seek to partner with companies that do the same, we cannot guarantee the security of any information transmitted to or from or via the Fuelly Service, and we are not responsible for the actions of any third parties that may receive any such information.
