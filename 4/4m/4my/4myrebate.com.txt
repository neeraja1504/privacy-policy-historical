Sharing of Information with third-parties:
Merchandizing Partners:
Rebate Center works with Merchandizing Partners to offer consumers rebate choices such as selected merchandise or services instead of the customary cash rebate. For those customers who elect to redeem their rebate by selecting the merchandise or services offered by our Merchandizing Partners, we provide the Merchandizing Partners with the customer's information necessary for them to fulfill the customer's selection. Such information will include the name, address, phone, and email address of the customer. Use of customers' information by Merchandizing Partners is governed by the privacy policy of the company offering the particular merchandize or product.
Independent Contractors:
We may employ other companies or individuals to provide certain services to us such as analyzing customer lists and data, providing marketing assistance, or consulting services. These third parties will have access to the information needed to perform their functions but cannot use that information for any other purpose. Any 3rd parties who use our data will be fully bound by this privacy policy. In no event will the data being used by any unrelated third party include your email address.
Aggregate information:
From time to time we may provide aggregate customer information (e.g.: rebate dollar value, category of product from rebate, job function, industry) by Rebate Center during the processing of rebates. The recipients of this aggregate information may be 3rd parties, vendors and affiliated business partners. This information does not allow 3rd parties, vendors and affiliated business partners to identify you individually in any way.
Third Party Transaction-Level Data:
If you visit our site from a third-party site the third-party site may be able to access select information from your individual transaction information. In order to track and credit your transaction the third-party site may give you a unique code, cookie or graphic which will uniquely identify you. This will only happen if you link directly from a third party site to our Web site. Any transactions made at our Web site while such a code is active will be reported back to the third party site. We will only report non-personal information to these sites such as the date of the transaction, the product(s) purchased and the amount spent. We will not report any information to these third party sites that will allow them to personally identify you and will never share your email address with any 3rd party. The presence of a 3rd party navigation bar atop our site is an indication that the third party site may be able to see your activity on our site.
Link to Third Party Site:
Our Web site contains certain links to third party sites, such as our vendors. Rebate Center is not responsible or liable for the privacy practices or content found on these sites. We suggest that you check the Privacy Notice of each site you visit.
Law Enforcement and Protection of Users:
We will release personally identifiable information to third-parties and organizations when we believe it is appropriate for us to do so to comply with the law. We will also do so to cooperate with law enforcement investigations, comply with court orders or subpoenas, protect the legal rights of us and our Users, or when we believe it is needed for fraud protection and/ or credit risk reduction.
Business Transfer:
In the unlikely event that Rebate Center is sold, has its assets acquired or transferred, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, or merges or becomes affiliated with any other division, individual or entity, any customer information owned or under the control of Rebate Center may be one of the transferred assets.
