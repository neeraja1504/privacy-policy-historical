How womenshealth.gov uses third-party websites and applications
Third-Party Websites and Applications (TPWA) are web-based technologies that are not exclusively operated or controlled by The Office on Women's Health (OWH), such as non-.gov hosted applications and those embedded on an OWH Web page that could cause personally identifiable information (PII) to become available or accessible to OWH, regardless of whether OWH solicits or collects it.
As part of the Open Government Directive, OWH uses a variety of new technologies and social media options to communicate and interact with citizens. These sites and applications include popular social networking and media sites, open source software communities and more. The following list includes the websites and applications we use and their purposes. For any sites or applications that collect PII, this list also includes details on information collected and how OWH protects your private information.
Third-party websites and applications
AddThis – The Office on Women's Health (OWH) uses the AddThis service to allow visitors to bookmark and share website content on a variety of social media sites. Visitors who use the AddThis service to share content do not need to register or provide any personal information. The AddThis service providers collect non-personal data, including the aggregate and summary statistics on browsers and usage patterns. AddThis also uses non-personal data to manage the service efficiently and diagnose server problems. Although AddThis offers some analytics and usage data to OWH, these reports do not include any personally identifiable information. The reports are password protected and only available to members of OWH and other designated staff requiring this information to perform their duties. View the AddThis privacy policy.
Google URL Shortener – The Office on Women's Health (OWH) uses Google URL Shortener to shorten long URLs for use in email and text messages, Twitter feeds, and on Facebook pages. Google URL Shortener collects and provides data on how often email and text message recipients and Facebook and Twitter-users click on the shortened URLs distributed by OWH staff. Google URL Shortener analytics show how many people clicked on the URLs posted by girlshealth.gov compared to the total number of clicks on the shortened URLs. Google URL Shortener analytics do not provide any personally identifiable information about the visitors who opened the shortened links. View the Google privacy policy.
Facebook – The Office on Women's Health (OWH) has three Facebook pages: Office on Women's Health, Girlshealth.gov, and Best Bones Forever!. OWH staff post news and other items of interest to citizens on the Facebook pages. If you have a Facebook account or "like" the OWH Facebook pages, you can post comments or click on the "like" option for individual entries. If you comment or click on the "like" button, personally identifying information will be visible to womenshealth.gov staff and other Facebook site visitors. The amount of visible personal information will depend on your own Facebook privacy settings. You can completely avoid displaying any personally identifiable information by not creating an account, not posting comments, and not clicking on the "like" options in Facebook. OWH staff does not collect, use, or disclose any information about visitors who comment or "like" the womenshealth.gov Facebook pages. Facebook collects and reports on non-personally identifiable information about activities on Facebook pages. This information is password protected and only available to members of OWH and other designated staff who require this information to perform their duties. View the Facebook privacy policy.
Twitter – The Office on Women's Health (OWH) has four Twitter accounts: @womenshealth, @girlshealth, @bestbones4ever, and @SaludDLaMujer. OWH uses Twitter to send short messages (up to 140 characters) or "Tweets" to share information about OWH with visitors and respond to comments and inquiries sent via Twitter to OWH. While visitors may read the OWH Twitter feeds without subscribing to them, visitors who want to subscribe to (or follow) OWH Twitter feeds must create a Twitter account. To create an account, you must provide some personal information, such as name, user name, password, and email address. Visitors have the option to provide additional personal information including a short biography, location, or a picture. Most information you provide for a Twitter account is available to the public, but you can modify how much of your information is visible by changing your privacy settings at the Twitter.com website. OWH staff members monitor the number of subscribers and respond to comments and queries via Twitter, but the staff never takes possession of the personal information belonging to Twitter followers. OWH does not collect, maintain, disclose, or share any information about people who follow OWH on Twitter. View the Twitter privacy policy.
YouTube – OWH embeds videos from YouTube on Web pages. You do not need to register with either YouTube or Google (YouTube owner) to watch embedded videos. When visitors watch videos, YouTube may record non-personally identifiable information about its site usage, such as channels used, videos watched, and data transfer details to improve its services. If you log on to the YouTube site before watching a video, YouTube may associate information about your site use with your YouTube account. If you log on to YouTube and comment on an embedded video, any personal information you included when registering for your account will be visible to visitors who click on the comment. If you do not log in before watching an embedded video, your site use will not be associated with you or a YouTube account. View the YouTube privacy policy.
