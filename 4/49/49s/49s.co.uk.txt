7. SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
Information security is important to us and we understand the techniques required to secure this information. Security measures are in place to protect Your information from access by unauthorised persons and to prevent unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction and damage.
Personal Information received directly from You will be stored in a password-protected database located within our secure network behind active state of the art firewall software.
We also employ appropriate organisation measures to prevent unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction and damage to Your Personal Information, including agent/employee training and up to date security policies.
The sending of information via the internet cannot be completely secure at all times. Although we will make every reasonable effort to protect Your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information disclosed online. In opening an account with us, You accept the potential security risks of internet use and will not hold us responsible for any breach of security unless it has been proved that we have been negligent or at fault. For Your own privacy protection we encourage You not to include sensitive information, for example credit/debit card numbers, in any e-mails sent to us.
While we have implemented appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the safety of Your Personal Information, due to the continually evolving state of technology and business, coupled with its complexity, we are not able to guarantee error-free performance in relation to the privacy of Your Personal Information.
Any Personal Information provided by You by way of a written form in relation to account opening is Your responsibility. Where written Personal Information is provided to us as part of an account opening process, You must ensure that You obtain the original form following the electronic input of Your Personal Information.
Protection of any information or images provided to a third-party online site that links to or from the Service, cannot be guaranteed. This includes (without limitation) information collected by any third-party managing our affiliate program or any other program, as these third-party online sites are owned and operated independently of us.
Information gathered by these third parties will fall under their privacy policy rather than ours. If You have any queries regarding a third-party's privacy policy, You should obtain this information directly from them.
We are not responsible or liable for:
the actions or policies of these third parties; or
any third-party links or the content or privacy practices of these online sites.
8. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS
Personal Information collected in accordance with this Privacy Policy may be stored and processed in any country in which we, our affiliates, suppliers, partners, subcontractors and other selected third parties have facilities. All our servers are located in the EU and we will not transfer Your Personal Information to a country not authorised by the European Commission as having equivalent protections unless You have consented to such transfer or where You are resident in such country and/or it is necessary to do so to perform any contract with you.
