Privacy Policy
By entering this website, you consent to the use of your personal information as set forth below. You can read our
Privacy Policy below to see what information we collect and our security assurance.
This Privacy Policy covers the treatment of personally identifiable information that is collected by 4Life Research, and
each of 4Life’s subsidiary companies, when you are on a 4Life website.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that 4Life does not own or control or to people that
4Life does not employ or manage.
4Life uses information for five general purposes: to customize the advertising and content you see, to fulfill your
requests for certain products, to contact you about specials and new products, to maintain and manage the distributor
genealogy, and to allow other distributors to manage their businesses.
Information Sharing. 4Life uses the information we collect solely for our business purposes. We do not sell or
share personal information to third parties other than those third parties who provide services vital to our business
(see Third-Party Providers, below) and to other distributors (see Other Distributors, below). However, we may also
provide aggregate information and statistics about our customers, sales and related site information to our third-party
providers, but this information and statistics will include no personally identifiable information. Please note that we
may release information in good faith as is reasonably necessary to comply with the law or protect our rights.
Cookies and Sessions. Cookies are essential “invisible” data files that act as an electronic messenger between your
computer or device and our website. Internet browsers have a notification option to let you know when an “invisible”
cookie is being sent to you. Through your browser options you can choose not to accept the cookie. However, in not
accepting the cookie, you may not be able to experience all functions of 4life.com.
Sessions are encrypted and enable us to temporarily save personal information about you on our server. The most
basic session information includes data about what is in your shopping basket. Each time you login, a new session
is created pulling your information from 4Life’s database. This saves you time, as you will not have to re-input your
Personal Information each time you visit or shop with us. 4Life uses sessions, rather than cookies, as an enhanced
security measure.
We may use your IP address to identify and verify secure logins, help diagnose problems with our servers, and to
administer our websites. Your IP address also may be used to gather broad demographic information and to recognize
customer traffic patterns and site usage. This information aids us in merchandising and in developing the design and
layout of the site.

third-party providers include merchant processing, delivery service providers and our software providers.
Other Distributors. As a network marketing company, 4Life provides certain information to distributors regarding
the other distributors and customers in a distributor’s line of sponsorship. If you enroll as a distributor with 4Life,
your name, rank, email address, address, telephone number and Life Points purchased will be provided to other
distributors in your upline and/or downline. No other personally identifiable information will be shared with other
distributors.
Security. Whether you place an order or create a profile, we use industry-standard secure server software (SSL) that

protected against unauthorized access. Credit card numbers are encrypted in accordance with PCI compliance.
No data transmission over the Internet will be 100% secure. While we take steps to protect your personal information,
we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. Upon
receiving your transmission, we make all reasonable efforts to ensure its security on our systems. However, you are
