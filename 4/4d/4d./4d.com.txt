4. Personal data collected automatically
When browsing 4D sites, your computer will interact with a server which provides all requested resources. It does so by automatically saving each operation to a specific file where your computer is identified by its IP address.
Your browser automatically sends us some standard data.
In addition to your IP address, it sends the type of browser you use, its features, your operating system, identification of third party sites (Facebook, Twitter, etc.) from which you are possibly connected as well as dates and times of access to the site.
This automatic collection allows us to monitor the general activity of the site, identify possible errors, and ensure that the site has the appropriate material resources.
This data, and in particular your IP address, does not allow us to identify you by name, except by requesting it from your service provider. This is only possible in the context of a legal proceeding.
We automatically collect information during each visit you make to our sites (pages, links, documents consulted, number of bytes transferred, etc.).
This information helps facilitate the consultation of our sites by not requiring you to provide the same information for each new visit or by personalizing content according to the preferences or interests that you may have set.
For this reason, our sites issue cookies.
We may use cookies to record your user ID (digital identity) to facilitate your search for information and your connection to our sites, as well as to keep other information of interest for the functioning of your session.
Some of these cookies, especially those relating to your visit, are automatically deleted at the end of your session.
They are kept within the time frames set by the CNIL for soliciting customers and prospects.
Finally, other cookies are used in an aggregated way and are therefore anonymous. These allow us to improve navigation ergonomics and to identify the interests of internet users as a whole.
You are free to accept or refuse these cookies. You only need to modify your browser settings to refuse cookies or to be notified if a cookie is stored on your computer.
You can also delete cookies stored on your computer to permanently delete the information they contain.
5.    Cookie management

You can always choose to disable these cookies. You can accept or reject them on a case-by-case basis or refuse them once and for all.

Depending on the type of cookies you want to disable, you can express your choice:

5.2 Via your browser settings
Most browsers accept cookies by default. However, you may decide to block these cookies or ask your browser to do it for you.
You can accept or refuse cookies on a case-by-case basis or refuse them systematically.
