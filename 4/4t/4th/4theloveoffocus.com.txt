Privacy Policy:
Magdalena Renata (" Magdalena ") operates 4theloveoffocus.com and may operate other websites. It is Retana policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.
Website Visitors
Like most website operators, Magdalena collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Retana purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Retana visitors use its website. From time to time, Magdalena may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
Magdalena also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on 4theloveoffocus.com blogs/sites. Magdalena only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog/site where the comment was left.
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to Retana websites choose to interact with Magdalena in ways that require Magdalena to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Magdalena gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up at 4theloveoffocus.com to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Magdalena are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Magdalena collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Magdalena. Magdalena does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Retana websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.
