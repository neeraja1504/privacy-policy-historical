407 ETR's Privacy Policy | 407 ETR
Last Updated: December 18, 2018
Your privacy is paramount
Protecting your privacy is a top priority for us, so we've written this Privacy Policy to let you know about your rights and our obligations when it comes to the collection, use, disclosure and retention of your Personal Information. For your convenience, this Policy is made available and updated online at www.407etr.com and, at your request, can also be printed and provided to you. We may update this Policy at any time and, if we do, we'll notify you in writing and/or note this on our website.
Who are we exactly?
407 ETR operates and manages Highway 407 ETR, and we also provide tolling and back office services for the Province of Ontario's Highway 407 and Highway 412, (altogether, the "Toll Highways"). This means that two privacy laws can apply when we collect, use or disclose your Personal Information: Canada's Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) for Highway 407 ETR, and Ontario's Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA) for the Province of Ontario's Highway 407 and Highway 412.

What's Personal Information?
Personal Information is any information about an identifiable individual where the information, alone or with other information that's reasonably available, can be used to identify that person. Certain information is exempted, however, like somebody's business contact information that's used to communicate about his or her employment, business or profession.
Types of Personal Information we collect
We collect the Personal Information listed below mainly to bill customers, and also to fulfill the other purposes described in, "How we use your Personal Information".

The Mobile App is further described in, “407 ETR’s Mobile App”, below***
To protect your privacy, we automatically blur camera images of the front windshield portion of your vehicle. In limited situations, the blurring of images may be imperfect, or temporarily suspended so we can test, maintain and improve our tolling technology. Any Personal Information collected as a result will be promptly destroyed after we fulfill such purposes.
** Nonvehicle geolocation data may be collected by the Mobile App strictly for the purposes of testing and calibration, and to trouble-shoot tools used to monitor vehicle driving patterns.

Note that you may choose to limit the Personal Information disclosed to us by opening an "Anonymous Account" for travel on the Toll Highways.
We also collect Personal Information from third parties for the purposes described in, "How we use your personal information", below. For example, we may collect Personal Information from the Ontario Ministry of Transportation (MTO), other toll road operators, motor transport administrators, credit reporting agencies and collection agencies in order to collect and enforce amounts owing.

Responding to a subpoena, warrant, court order, or the request of a government institution with lawful authority for the purpose of enforcing or investigating a violation of law
Complying with, or supporting compliance with, relevant laws and regulations
Limits to our collection, use, disclosure and retention
We'll only collect, use and disclose the Personal Information we need to achieve the identified purposes. For example, only Personal Information required to achieve a particular purpose will be disclosed to those who are responsible for helping us achieve that purpose, and these recipients must have already agreed to treat your Personal Information confidentially and securely, in accordance with our privacy laws. Rest assured, we'll never disclose your Personal Information to other parties for other purposes, unless required by law, nor will we trade or sell your Personal Information. We'll also keep your Personal Information only as long as it's needed to achieve the identified purpose or as required by law. After that, we'll delete it and require anyone else with your Personal Information to delete it too.
How we get your consent
Subject to applicable laws like the Highway 407 Act and Highway 407 East Act , we won't collect, use or disclose your Personal Information without your consent. In such cases, we'll clearly explain to you the reasons why we need your Personal Information so that you can make an informed decision, whether to consent or not. Based on our explanation, you should be able to understand the nature, purpose and consequences of the collection, use or disclosure of your Personal Information. If not, please let us know so we can clarify or elaborate.
Your consent can be express (written, verbal and/or electronic) or implied (through your action or inaction). When necessary, we'll ask for your express or "opt-in" consent with respect to more sensitive Personal Information and/or where a new purpose is identified, such as for purposes of the Mobile App described in part 10 of, “How we use your Personal Information”, above.
In other cases, we'll rely on implied or "opt-out" consent, such as by your travel of the Toll Highways or your use of our online services, in order to collect, use and disclose Personal Information to help achieve the purposes described in parts 5 through 9 of, "How we use your Personal Information".
In limited circumstances, the law allows us to forgo obtaining consent, such as when the use or disclosure of Personal Information is for the purposes described in parts 1 through 4 or 11 of, "How we use your Personal Information".
Withdrawing your consent
Where consent was required to use your Personal Information, you may withdraw it at any time by informing us through email, phone, mail, or in person. In the case of the Mobile App, you may withdraw your consent to our collection of Personal Information by deleting the Mobile App. If you would like to request that Personal Information already collected by the Mobile App not be used or that such information be deleted, please contact us with your request and we'll delete or render unidentifiable your Personal Information. Withdrawing your consent may limit the services we can provide to you. Further, if you have a balance owing or continue to travel on the Toll Highways we will still need to retain and use your Personal Information to continue providing services to you.
Protecting your Personal Information
We protect your Personal Information in a number of ways:
Physically - Drawers, cabinets and offices are locked when not in use
Technologically - Passwords, encryption and other technological safeguards are used to prevent unauthorized access
Organizationally - Security clearance and verification procedures are followed so that those employees who need access to your Personal Information to do their job have access. All employees undergo regular data security training
Contractually - Vendors that need access your Personal Information must agree to comply with the principles in this Policy, our privacy laws, and appropriate data security requirements so that, wherever your Personal Information is, there will be a comparable level of protection
In most cases, your Personal Information is used, disclosed and retained in Ontario, Canada. In some situations, however, we may disclose your Personal Information outside of Ontario or Canada in order to achieve the identified purposes, such as for collecting tolls or to comply with a legal request. Since outside jurisdictions may have different privacy standards, we try to limit such disclosure. Where disclosure is required, we ensure there is a comparable level of protection over your Personal Information.
Accessing your Personal Information
You have the right to know about the specific Personal Information we have about you. So, at your written request (with satisfactory identification), we'll be glad to provide you access to your Personal Information. There may be a small processing fee for this and we'll let you know ahead of time if there is. There may be times when we, unfortunately, cannot give you access to the Personal Information you're asking for, such as if giving you access would reveal another person's Personal Information, or if access would be harmful in a legal, security or commercial sense. We'll definitely write and let you know if this is the case and the reason(s) why we had to refuse your request. If you disagree with us, you can challenge our decision by responding back to us.
Updating your Personal Information
While we try to make sure that your Personal Information is up-to-date, you would know best if it were. From time to time, please review the Personal Information we have about you and, if a change or correction is needed, let us know right away! We'll make the needed updates to keep things running smoothly. You can review your Personal Information by looking at the correspondence we send to you, like your invoice, or simply request access to your Personal Information, as we've described above.
Note that while the law requires you to notify the MTO of a change in address within six days of moving, we're not provided these updates from the MTO. So, please let us know directly if you've moved.
We're accountable to you
We're accountable to you for your Personal Information, and that means we're responsible for the actions of anybody we've disclosed Personal Information to, including our employees, contractors and other third party representatives. As mentioned above, these parties are not provided your Personal Information unless it's necessary to achieve the identified purposes, and then only after they agree to follow the principles in this Policy, our privacy laws, and appropriate data security requirements.
407 ETR’s Mobile App
Your use of the Mobile App is subject to its terms of use (the “Terms of Use”), located at www.407etr.com. The types of location data and Personal Information we can collect depends on the privacy settings you choose on your mobile device. You may adjust your privacy and location settings in the Mobile App at any time to control which types of Personal Information we may collect about you and how your information is used. You can always change your location settings to control the information we may collect about your location and travel while you are not using the Mobile App. Certain app-related benefits may become unavailable or not function as expected if you choose to disable or limit location services.
Logins made easier
We may provide you with the option to sign-on to our services (e.g., through the Mobile App) using existing information from social networking services such as Facebook, Twitter or Google. By choosing this single sign-on option, you agree that we may use certain Personal Information to simplify the login process for you and avoid the need to create a new account with us.
Aggregated Data
We may collect aggregated data using 407 ETR technology or from third parties. Aggregated data refers to data from multiple sources that can show us group-based trends. This data does not identify you or anyone else but, for example, relates to the driving patterns of hundreds or thousands of commuters who use Highway 407 ETR. These patterns may be attributed to individual customers, allowing us to better manage traffic, respond to customer needs or preferences, and promote our services.
