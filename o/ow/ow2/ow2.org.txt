OW2 - Privacy_Policy - OW2 Privacy Policy
At OW2 we take your right to privacy seriously. We have updated our privacy policy and drafted this new privacy notice to provide you with all information, as required by law, in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible way, in clear and plain language. This privacy policy describes the information we collect from you and how it may be stored and processed. It must be clear and easy for you to exercise the rights you are granted under data protection legislation, and for you to choose how you want to hear from us. Please let us know if anything is missing or unclear on this page.
The OW2 privacy policy was updated in view of the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which came into force on the 25th of May 2018. GDPR is the short name for REGULATION (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 27 April 2016. The regulation concerns the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data. The text of the regulation is broadly publicised and can be found in extenso on the European Commission website here.
OW2's compliance with GDPR is a relatively light constraint.
We keep a simplified registry of our processing resources, as per Recital 13 which states that " To take account of the specific situation of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, this Regulation includes a derogation for organisations with fewer than 250 employees with regard to record-keeping. ".
We do not need to designate a Data Processing Officer as per Article 37: OW2 is not a " public authority or body ", we host no processing that " require regular and systematic monitoring of data subjects ", nor do we process " special categories of data pursuant to Article  9 and personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences referred to in Article 10.".
We must reconfirm our newsletter mailing list; as per Recital 32 " Consent should be given by a clear affirmative act establishing a freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her, such as by a written statement, including by electronic means, or an oral statement. ".
This notice is to comply with Article 13 of the GDPR regulation. It requests that we, " at the time when personal data are obtained, provide the data subject with the following further information necessary to ensure fair and transparent processing:  "
