• Proof of your identity and bank account information,
• Details of services or products you enquire about or get from us, as well as information necessary to respond to
your query or provide you with services or products, including your transactions.
If you choose to pay someone else, for example, add a payment recipient on our website, we will ask you for your recipient’s name, email address, bank account information and physical address. This is necessary for us to make a payment to them and you confirm that you know they agree or that you are otherwise allowed to give us this information.
We get this information from :
• You, for example, when you complete application forms, the way you use our products or services including information from your digital devices (such as checks of the IP address your device connectsfrom) and your dealings with us, including telephone conversations and social media, and
• Third parties, such as people appointed to act on your behalf or credit reference agencies, who may check information against other databases to which they have access. Find out more information on the use of your personal data by the credit reference agencies.
We will make reasonable efforts to tell you if we have collected personal information about you from someone else.
How we use your p ersonal information
We use your personal information:
• To provide our products and services to you,
• For security purposes and to verify your identity,
• For administration, planning and account management,
• To monitor, develop and improve our services and for training and quality purposes, for example, we may record calls,
• To prevent and detect fraud, money laundering and other crime and to comply with the law. This may include checking your location when you use a mobile device to help prevent fraud,

It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our service providers and including in countries such as Australia, United States, Canada and Hong Kong. Such staff are likely to be involved in, among other things, processing your transaction or payment details and providing support services. By giving your personal information, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing.
Where we share information with an organisation outside the EEA, we will take all reasonable steps to ensure that they apply equivalent levels of protection as we are required to provide. If this is not possible, for example, we are required by law to disclose your information, we will make sure that sharing the information is lawful.
If we wish to provide your personal information to anyone else, we will identify them and obtain your consent before doing so, unless the provision of that information to that third party is permitted by law.
