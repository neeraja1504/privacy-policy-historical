Contact information such as your name, phone and fax numbers, address and email address; and

Demographic information such as your job title, job description and company name and company type.
If you submit content to Shutterstock for licensing, you may be asked to provide the following information:
Contact information such as your name, phone and fax numbers, address and email address; and
Shutterstock will verify this information by asking you to either: a) upload a scan of a government issued ID (which will be stored on our servers); or b) provide a credit card number. Your credit card number will be used solely for the purpose of verifying your name and address. The credit card number will not be stored.
Payment and contributor information including, but not limited to, payout method, payout email, desired display name, skill level, content focus, etc.
