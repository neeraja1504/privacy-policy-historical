**Frequently Asked Questions
**
Q. | Can you tell me the location of the trails you have been to in the trail reports?
A. | All of the locations in the trail reports are privately owned locations that we as a group had permission in some fashion to be on.   Most of the trail runs were organized through an off-road club or other 4x4 organization which was posted, if available, in the report itself.  With the exception of Paragon Adventure Park, locations can not be disclosed due to the fact that they are private property.  Clubs who have organized events and make scheduled  trail runs are linked within the trail report.  Your best way to find out how you can find trails in your area is to join a local club and go on scheduled, organized events. ** Check out our US Clubs section for a club near you.  If you are aware of trails in your area but need further details on those trails, your best bet is to study topography maps or satellite imagery.  For more info on these type of maps, see this link: Click Here.
Q. | I have a site or I have a business that I would like Offroaders to link to.   Can you post my link?
A. | You can send the link. If you are trading links (reciprocating a link) we will return the link to your site.
