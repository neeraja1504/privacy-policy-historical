Terms of Service
By agreeing to our policies you agree to NOT share out private training material with anyone for any reason outside the private student Facebook group. Kevin David has poured his heart and soul into this training and sharing it, or intending to distribute it without our direct and express consent is prohibited.
We at THATLifestyleNinja LLC want you to be satisfied with your purchase of the Shopify Ninja Masterclass and/or any of our products.
If you have any questions or problems, please let us know by contacting our talented support team directly at support@officialkevindavid.com.
In the event that you decide your purchase was not the right decision, contact our support team and show us you actually did the work and attempted to free yourself financially and create a new career with Shopify. We will review your viewership percentage of course material and attempt to help correct the issue. If we cannot help solve the issue, and you have viewed less than 40% of course content we’ll issue you a prompt FULL refund.
To be eligible for a refund, you must submit your request on or before 11:59pm Eastern Standard Time on the 14th day following your purchase. After you submit your materials, all refunds are discretionary and based on viewership of course material and involvement in student group discussions, Q&A sessions and general commitment to the course material as decided solely by Support team and Kevin David.
No refunds will be provided more than 14 days following the date of purchase or if viewership exceeds the 40% threshold noted in our policies (viewership is calculated by total watch time of videos in the main 8 modules). If you opted for a payment plan and you view more than 40% of course content OR do not request a refund by the end of the 14th day, you are required to complete the remaining payments of your payment plan. All payments must be made on a timely basis.
