Who We Are
OfficeVP, LLC. has developed and licenses a system software product called OfficeF5 which allows Independent Marketing Agents to promote a legal and ethical network marketing opportunity and/or Client program and/or opportunities or programs and/or products of their choice. The OfficeF5 is designed to be used exclusively to promote the products and Services offered by the system. However, due to the fact that each OfficeF5 account is controlled by an independent representative, we cannot guarantee how the system and privacy information will be managed by these representatives.

Individuals that subscribe to the OfficeF5 do so in one of two forms: prospects (sometimes referred to as Pre-Enrollees), and Members. Individual subscriptions to the OfficeF5 are referred to as a "Member" in the OfficeF5.
To cater to both you (the Customer) and our Members, we may be required to collect, use, and share certain information. The type of information we collect, together with a description of how we use and/or share it, is described below.
