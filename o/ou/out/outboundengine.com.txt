6. Third-Party Tracking and Online Advertising
We may share, or we may permit third-party online advertising networks, social media companies and other third-party services, to collect information about your use of our Sites and Services over time so that they may play or display ads that may be relevant to your interests on our Sites as well as on other websites or apps, or on other devices you may use. Typically, though not always, the information we share is provided through cookies or similar tracking technologies, which recognize the device you are using and collect information, including hashed data, click stream information, browser type, time and date you visited the site, and other information. This information is used to display targeted ads on or through our Sites or on other websites, apps or services.  We or the online advertising networks use this information to make the advertisements you see online more relevant to your interests. We may also display targeted advertising to you through social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and others. These companies have interest-based advertising programs that allow us to direct advertisements to users who have shown interest in our Service or our Customers’ services while those users are on the social media platform, or to groups of other users who share similar traits, such as likely commercial interests and demographics. These advertisements are governed by the privacy policies of those social media companies that provide them.
As noted above, depending on your browser or mobile device, you may be able to manage cookies and other tracking technologies through the settings on your browser or mobile device.  You may also be able to limit interest-based advertising through the settings on your mobile device by selecting “limit ad tracking” (iOS) or “opt-out of interest based ads” (Android).  To learn more about interest-based advertising and how you may be able to opt-out of some of this advertising, you may wish to visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s online resources, at http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices, and/or the DAA’s resources at www.aboutads.info/choices, and you may also adjust your ad preferences through your Facebook settings.  You may also be able to opt-out of some – but not all – interest-based ads served by mobile ad networks by visiting http://youradchoices.com/appchoices and downloading the mobile AppChoices app.
Google Analytics and Advertising. We may also utilize certain forms of display advertising and other advanced features through Google Analytics, such as Remarketing with Google Analytics, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. These features enable us to use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick advertising cookie) or other third-party cookies together to inform, optimize, and display ads based on your past visits to the Sites. You may control your advertising preferences or opt-out of certain Google advertising products by visiting the Google Ads Preferences Manager, currently available at https://google.com/ads/preferences, or by visiting NAI’s online resources at http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices.

We may retain information we collect until we no longer need the information to fulfill our legitimate business purposes, or for a period of time specifically required or allowed by applicable laws, rules or regulations. We may, though we have no obligation to, retain Customer Data beyond the term of the Customer agreement unless we receive a deletion request from a Customer.
If you no longer want us to maintain or use your information, you can send an e-mail to support@outboundengine.com.  Please note that even after we delete your personal data, we may retain some information as necessary to fulfill our legitimate business interests, such as fraud detection and prevention, and to comply with our legal obligations.
