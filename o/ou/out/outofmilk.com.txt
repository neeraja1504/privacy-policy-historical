as service provider in the sense of the German Telemedia Act (TMG) and data controller in terms of the Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (Data Protection Regulation, “GDPR”). The term "OOM" in this document means www.outofmilk.com and the various apps OOM, each including all available services, contents and functionalities. Specific parts of OOM are hereinafter referred to as "online services".
Our services are intended for adult consumers and not for children. We do not knowingly collect personal data of users that are children in accordance with the national legislation.
Collection and processing of personal data
In general, you can use online services for which no payment or registration is required, without providing personal information. In certain cases, we process the below listed personal data. This is done in principle only to the extent necessary to provide a functioning website or app and our content and services. In addition, we process personal data related to the use of OOM if you provide it voluntarily, e.g. as part of a registration, a request to us, a job application or in the completion of a subscription, or because a different legal basis exists (see paragraph 4). If you do not want your data processed as described, you can not use our services or do not take full advantage of.
Categories of data processed
Once you use OOM, our system automatically collects information from the computer system of the calling computer. The following data are collected among others:
user's browser type, language and version
user's operating system
the IP address of the user’s device
date and time (time zone)
access status / http status code
websites from which the system of the user on our website reaches
websites and events that are requested by the user's system via our website (e.g. certain offers, supermarkets, regions)
search requests by the user and search results
location region of the user (to the extend enabled by user)
login of the user (if used)
volume data transmitted
web analytics data and pseudonymous user profiles (IDs)
errors, technical malfunctions
Furthermore, we process the following personal data in case of a contractual relationship between you and us or you have the data transmitted to us otherwise e. g. login, newsletter or contact form.
We store the data in our log files. If an error occurs at an interface query, we also log the ID (pseudonymous identification), the IP address and the relevant HTTP request and, if used, the email of requesting user to enable subsequent error analysis and correction.
Legal reasons and purpose of processing
We process your data solely on the basis of one or more of the possible legal basis.
According to GDPR personal data may be processed in particular because of a contract or the implementation of pre-contractual measures, if there is an agreement, due to a legitimate interest or a law, and to protect the vital or public interests.
Users can register at OOM using login services as mentioned below. The collection and processing of this data is for the fulfillment of the usage agreement between us and the user, art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR.
Your e-mail address collected during registration or during the performance of the contract is used also to generally notify you by e-mail about own similar goods or services, as well as existing subscriptions or OOM. The processing of the e-mail address in this case is based on our legitimate interest in the application of our goods and services (art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR).
We also use your e-mail address to send you our newsletter if you have given us your prior express consent to receive a newsletter or advertising. In this case, we use your email address to send you the newsletter as desired (art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR). You can withdraw your consent to the use of your e-mail address for such purposes at any time in writing or in text form at the above contact details with effect for the future.
On the internet, each device needs to transfer data with a unique address, called an IP address. The at least temporary storage of the IP address is technically required to enable delivery of the site to the computer of the user. Our server store your IP address for up to 8 weeks for our own security and billing purposes before pseudonymization by servers. Because the repeated automated reading of Web sites (so-called. Scraping) is complicated by acquiring the IP address. Moreover, we collect (without passing on to our advertisers) if users repeatedly click certain advertisements.
Purpose of our services is to show users regionally relevant information. This so-called geo-localization, that is the assignment of a visit of a website to the place of such visit, is provided on the basis of the anonymous IP address and within the geographical level of regions. Moreover, the user can give the consent for detecting the actual location of the device and withdraw such consent by means of the device.
Data processing operations that are not covered by one or more of the aforementioned legal bass, are carried out when it is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the us or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child (art. 6 lit. f GDPR). A legitimate interest is deemed to exist if the data subject is a client of OOM (usage agreement). If processing of personal data is based on this, our legitimate interest is in particular the implementation of our business towards the welfare of all our employees and our shareholders.
Our legitimate interest to be able to offer tailor-made products, to inform you of our products, innovations and quality characteristics, and constantly improve our services and products, thereby also increase our revenue, is the legal basis for processing data for the purposes of big data, direct marketing (own Advertising and advertising of third parties), usage-based online advertising, web analytics and advertising scoring (merging of different selection criteria for the appropriate advertising). By (also not technically necessary) cookies, we learn how the website is used and how we can improve our services constantly. We recognize that advertising prompted to visit our website (so-called. Conversion tracking). We can identify in relation to the data of the advertising campaigns, how successful the individual advertising measures are. By doing so, we are pursuing the interest to show you ads that are of interest to you, to make our website more interesting and easier for you and to achieve a fair calculation of advertising costs. For advertising and analysis services in detail see below.
Another legitimate interest is the functionality of the business processes, due to which data are processed for internal management purposes (e.g. accounting).
The processing of personal data within our company group is necessary and appropriate according to art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR (see FIG. recital 49).
You have the right to object to processing of personal data based on a legitimate interest at any time (see below).
In the event that the data are processed for another purpose as specified in the data collection purposes, we will conduct a compatibility check pursuant to art. 6 para. 4 GDPR. Further processing is then only casually when the original purpose of the new purpose is compatible or allowed due to a separate legal basis. Recognized compatible purposes include among others the establishment, exercise or defense of civil claims unless there is an overriding interest of the person concerned. In this case, we will inform you of the change in purpose. Is the new purpose incompatible with the specified collection for the purpose, a new survey is due to a new legal basis. Again, we will inform you of the change in purpose.
Place of processing
We do not transfer your personal data to countries outside the European Economic Area except in cases where it is permitted by the GDPR. Whether third parties with whom you have your own contractual relationship (such as with Facebook, if you have a Facebook account) transfer data to countries outside the European Economic Area, is neither under our control nor in our knowledge.
We process data in states outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). In order to ensure the protection of your personal information in the context of data transfers, we agree in contractual relationships with the recipients in third countries to standard contractual clauses of the European Commission in accordance with art. 46 para. 2 lit. c GDPR. The European Commission has made by order of 12. July 2016 the decision that under the provisions of the EU-US Privacy Shields an adequate level of protection exists (adequacy decision, art. 45 GDPR). More information - including the certification of service providers used by us - get you under https://www.privacyshield.gov.
Transfer of your data to third parties
We transmit your personal information to third parties only if (i) the transfer is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations to you, (ii) we are entitled by law to, (iii) or you have given us your consent.
We process personal data within our corporate group, including by OOM International GmbH, Berlin, Germany.
In certain cases, we also use external service providers who are engaged by us, as data processors. Such service providers are contractually obliged by us to the strict specifications of GDPR as data processors and may not use your data for any other purpose.
The transfer of data to processors are made on the basis of art. 28 para. 1 GDPR, or based on our legitimate interests using specialized processors and technical advantages, art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.
To the extent we are required by law or it is permitted by data protection laws, we will transmit personal data to authorities, such as the police or public prosecutor (art. 6 para. 1 lit. c GDPR). Sharing this data is based on our legitimate interest in combating abuse, the prosecution of criminal offenses and the assurance, assertion and enforcement of claims provided that your rights and interests in the protection of your personal data are not predominate, art. 6 para. 1 lit f GDPR.

It consists of a string by which websites and servers can be assigned to specific internet browser, in which the cookie is saved. This enables the visited websites and servers to distinguish the individual browser of the person affected from other internet browsers containing other cookies. A specific internet browser can be recognized through the unique cookie ID and identified.
We use two types of cookies. On the one hand technical necessary cookies, without there use the functionality of our site would be restricted, and optional cookies to make our website more user-friendly. By analyzing cookies we learn how the site is used and can improve our services constantly. For more information on the individual analysis services see below.
Advertisements are usually provided by third party. This may and to the extent permitted by your device settings use information about your visits so that ads can appear on products and services that you may be interested. Specific contact information such as your name, address, or phone number won’t be transferred unless stated otherwise in this privacy policy.
You can always prevent the use of cookies by us by the settings of the internet browser used and thus contradict permanently the use of cookies.

If you access our website from multiple devices and browsers, you must therefore contradict separately and again on each of these devices and in any browser data collection.
When using apps a comparable function is implemented instead of the cookie.
You cannot identify a person by cookies. The use of cookies is justified on the basis of our legitimate interest in a customized design and statistical analysis of OOM (art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR).

We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google. Google Analytics also uses cookies, which enable the analysis of the user's navigation through and use of the website. The data generated by the cookie about your use of this website (including your IP address) is generally transferred and stored on a Google server in the USA. OOM has activated IP anonymisation on the websites via the supplemental code “ga('set', 'anonymizeIp', true)” so that Google will truncate your IP address (known as IP masking) within Member States of the European Union or other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. In exceptional cases only, the full IP address will first be transferred to a Google server in the USA and then truncated there. Google will use this information on behalf of OOM for the purpose of analysing your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for OOM and providing other services relating to website and Internet use. Google may also transfer this data to third parties where required to do so by law or insofar as third parties have been commissioned by Google to process this data. Any information that Google receives within the scope of Internet-based advertising and from third party providers (e.g. demographic characteristics, gender and interests) could also be included in the cookie information. Google offers a Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on, which prevents data from being collected by Google Analytics and processed by Google. This add-on can be downloaded and installed here: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en.
OOM own analysis technology
OOM stores pseudonymous data for user profiles and uses this to recognize users with comparable services from OOM. This is based on cookies.
You may object from the analysis technology by opt-out link below. In this case for each visit a new cookie is placed thus no tracking possible anymore.
