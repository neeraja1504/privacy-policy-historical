Some widgets may utilize an optional import contacts feature to help you invite your contacts to download our widget.
This web site may include Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features may be transmitted to the Social Media Company and are governed by that company's privacy policy and terms of use.
We use various web site analytics tools and technologies regarding activities on our website that require storage of web session data.
