Shopify
A. The Outdoor Voices store is hosted on Shopify Inc. They provide us with the
online e-commerce platform that allows us to sell our products and services to
you. Your data is stored through Shopify’s data storage, databases and the general
Shopify application. They store your data on a secure server behind a firewall.
B. Payment
If you choose a direct payment gateway to complete your purchase, then
Shopify stores your credit card data. It is encrypted through the Payment Card
Industry Data Security Standard (pci-dss). Your purchase transaction data is
stored only as long as is necessary to complete your transaction. After that is
complete, your transaction information is deleted. All payment gateways adhere
to the standards set by pci-dss as managed by the pci Security Standards Coun-
cil, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, Mastercard, and American Express.
pci-dss requirements help ensure the secure handling of information by Outdoor
Voices and its service providers. For more insight, you may also read Shopify’s
proprietary Terms of Service or Privacy Policy, available via shopify.com.
Section No. 5 →
Third-Party Services
A. In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and dis-
close your information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the ser-
vices they provide to us. However, certain third-party providers have their own
privacy policies regarding the information we are required to provide to them for
your purchase-related transactions. For these providers, we recommend that you
read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in which your infor-
mation will be handled. Note that certain providers may be located in a different
jurisdiction than either you or OV. So if you elect to proceed with a transaction
that involves the services of a third-party service provider, then your informa-
tion may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service
provider or its facilities are located. As an example, if you are located in Canada
and your transaction is processed by a payment gateway located in the US, then
your personal information used in completing that transaction may be subject
to disclosure under US legislation, including the Patriot Act. Once you leave our
store’s website or are redirected to a third-party website or application, you are
p. 2 of 4 no longer governed by this Privacy Policy or our website’s Terms of Service.

Section No. 6 →
Security
A. To protect your personal information, we take reasonable precautions and
follow best practices to make sure it is not inappropriately lost, misused, ac-
cessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed. If you provide us with your credit card
information, that information is encrypted using secure socket layer technology
(ssl) and stored with an aes-256 encryption. Although no method of transmis-
sion over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, we follow all pci-dss
requirements and implement additional generally-accepted industry standards.
