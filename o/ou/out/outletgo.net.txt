Cookies
Like most websites, OutletGo.net uses cookies to store your profile. A cookie is a small text file placed on the user's hard drive containing information about the User and cannot be executed as code or deliver viruses. Logging in our web site using cookies is in no way linked to any personal private data. Once the member closes the browser, the cookie simply terminates. Cookies make the interaction between users and web sites faster and easier. Without cookies, it would be very difficult for a website to allow a visitor to fill up a shopping cart or to remember the user's preferences or registration details for a future visit.
Security Measures
No data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be perfectly secured.
While, our company takes all reasonable precautions to safeguard the privacy of your data, security risks cannot be completely eliminated and we therefore cannot guaranty total security.

We do not control or guarantee the correctness, timeliness, completeness, or relevance of any information or privacy policies posted on these linked websites.
