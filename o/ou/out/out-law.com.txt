Privacy Policy
Last updated: May 2018
Introduction
We are an international law firm that is committed to safeguarding the privacy and security of the personal information provided to us.
This policy sets out how we collect your personal information, what we do with it, how we keep it secure and explains your rights in relation to any personal information we hold about you.
More information can be provided upon request. Please contact us by sending an email to PrivacyTeam@pinsentmasons.com.
This is our global privacy policy. You can find a list of our offices and the jurisdictions in which we operate as well as country specific information here.
Who we are
Pinsent Masons provides legal services globally via a number of entities. Most of the firm's main IT systems are located in the UK and controlled by Pinsent Masons LLP. We are a data controller of the personal information we process and are therefore responsible for ensuring our systems, processes, suppliers, employees and partners comply with data protection laws in relation to the information we handle.
Depending on the location where legal or other services are provided, another entity in the Pinsent Masons group may be the data controller in relation to your personal information. For country specific information please click here.
When we say 'we' or 'us' in this policy, we're generally referring to Pinsent Masons LLP, its subsidiaries and any affiliates which it or its partners operate as separate businesses, such as Out-Law, Vario, MPillay and other Pinsent Masons affiliates worldwide. Reference to ‘Pinsent Masons’ is to Pinsent Masons LLP and/ or one or more of those subsidiaries or affiliates as the context requires.
Our privacy team oversees our compliance with data protection laws and this policy and provides guidance and advice to the firm, our employees and partners as required.
In addition, our Compliance Officer for Legal Practice (COLP) oversees compliance with our professional responsibilities and the reporting of any failures to comply with legislative requirements, including data protection.
Why do we process your personal information?
We process your personal information where:
it is necessary for the performance of a contract with you (eg. to provide legal services to you);
you have provided us with your consent to use your personal information (eg. in the course of subscribing to our newsletter or creating an online account via our website);
we are required or authorised by law to do so; or
it is necessary to pursue our legitimate interests in a way which is reasonably expected as part of running our business, which is not detrimental to you and would have minimal impact on your privacy.
Examples of where our use of personal information is necessary to pursue our legitimate interests include:
monitoring and recording information relating to your browsing behaviour on our website to make personalised content available to you;
monitoring and recording information relating to web based services including how and when the system is accessed and how data is uploaded for the purposes of analysing the performance of and improving the quality of the products and services we provide to you;
processing information relating to our client contacts to send them information about our products and services. This helps to facilitate our business development activities including building relationships with current and prospective clients; and
using our CRM system to analyse how our contacts interact with the firm which helps to inform our business development activities and determine how we grow our business.

Transfer of data between jurisdictions
As an international law firm, personal information may be transferred between our various offices worldwide (as listed on www.pinsentmasons.com) due to, for example, our shared IT systems and/or cross border working.

For example, an IT supplier may see your personal information when providing software support or a company which we use for a marketing campaign may process contacts' personal information for us.
When contracting with suppliers and/or transferring personal information to a different jurisdiction, the firm takes appropriate steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and the means of transfer provide adequate safeguards in accordance with applicable law.
