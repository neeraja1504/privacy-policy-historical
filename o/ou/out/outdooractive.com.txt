In the event that you are a 'Pro' customer, your bank details will also be collected.
(d) In addition to the data listed above, cookies are also saved when using our website. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your hard drive and assigned to your chosen browser through which certain information flows to the location that sets the cookie (in this case us). Cookies cannot run programs or transmit viruses to your computer. They serve to make the internet more user-friendly and effective.
(aa)The mobile app uses the following types of cookies, the scope and functionality of which are explained below:
–Transient cookies (refer to bb)
–Persistent cookies (refer to cc).
(bb)Transient cookies are automatically deleted once you close the app, including session cookies in particular. They store a so-called session ID, which assigns various requests to your mobile app. This allows your mobile device be recognized when you use it next time. Session cookies are deleted once you log out or close the app.
(cc)Persistent Cookies are automatically deleted after a specified period, which differs depending on the cookie itself. You can configure the settings of your device's operating system and the app to suit your preferences and, for example, decline to accept third party or all cookies. We would like to make you aware that doing this may make you unable to use all of the features of the app.
(e) For advertising purposes we use a so-called 'Advertising Identifier' (IDFA). This is a unique but non-personalized and non-permanent identification number for a particular device provided by iOS. The data collected through the IDFA will not be linked to any other device-related information. The IDFA is used by us to provide you with personalized advertising and to evaluate your use. If you enable 'no ad tracking' in the iOS setting under 'Privacy'-'Advertising', we are only able to take the following actions: Measure your interaction with banners by counting the number of times a banner is displayed without being clicked on ('frequency capping') and evaluate the click- through rate, unique user detection, unique user detection, security measures, fraud prevention and troubleshooting. You can delete the IDFA ('reset Advertising ID') at any time in the device settings, creating then a new IDFA that is not merged with the previously collected data. We would like to make you aware that restricting the use of the IDFA may make you unable to use all of the features of the app.
(f) Collection of your location data
(aa)Our products include so-called Location Based Services, with which we offer specific services that are tailored to your location. You are only able to use these functions after agreeing via a pop-up that we can anonymously collect both your data using GPS and your IP address for the purposes of providing a service. You can permit or disable this function within the settings of the app or your operating system at any point by calling up the settings in (...)
Your location will be regularly relayed to us following your confirmation, at which point we will only use your last recorded location and delete previous notifications relating to your location. When the location survey is active, your smartphone indicates that the data is being processed via a compass icon in the upper bar.
(bb)For the purposes of advertising, market research and demand-oriented design of the offer, we create user profiles using pseudonyms. These data are not combined with other personal data. You can object to this by clicking on the corresponding button in the app settings. You are also welcome to contact info@outdooractive.com or the address given in the imprint.
(g) When you start using our mobile app, we will request your permission via a pop-up to use your address book, calendar, photos and reminders.

We would like to make you aware that doing this may make you unable to use all of the features of the app. You can grant or refuse permission subsequently in the app's settings.
(bb)If you permit us access to this data, the mobile app will only access and transfer it to our server for purely functional purposes. Your data will be handled confidentially and deleted if either you remove permission for it to be used or if it is no longer required to render services and/or there is no legal need for it to be stored (legal basis is art. 6 para. 1 P. 1 lit. f DS-GVO)
