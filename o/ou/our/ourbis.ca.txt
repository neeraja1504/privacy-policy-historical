Information collected
Ourbis collects only minimal personal information about its users. They consist in a location (through a postal code) and an email address. We also log searches performed on the site to improve our engine based on real-world usage.
Personal information handling
User locations and email addresses are never disclosed in any way, be it to other users or third-parties. Ourbis will use email addresses sparingly to notify users of site news, and users can opt-in to receive more targeted email about local businesses.
Passwords are stored with encryption and can not be recovered by anyone, site administrators included.
Information removal
When users delete their profile, Ourbis will keep previous contributions (descriptions, photos, reviews) as anonymous and clear personal information such as user name, location, email address and password.
