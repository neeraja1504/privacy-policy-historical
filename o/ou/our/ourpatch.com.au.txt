1.2.3 The aggregated statistical information collected from cookies technology may be shared with our partners to help them understand how the community uses the site.  Such information does not include your personal data.
1.3 email
If you send us an email message we will record your email address. We will only use your email address for the purpose for which it was provided (for example, responding to a query).

We may also use that information to send you information about our products,  services and promotions.

1.6.4 A client’s credit card details are not stored anywhere on the Internet and the only company who has access to this data is the merchant’s bank. The bank also sends confirmation information via the same encryption technology back to the client’s browser. These secure processes provide clients with peace of mind when purchasing online.
1.6.5 If your browser or firewall doesn’t support SSL, you will not be able to connect to the server, which means you won’t be able to mistakenly place an order through an unsecured connection.
