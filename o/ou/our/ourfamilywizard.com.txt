Cookies
We use cookies to distinguish you from other users. This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you use the Platforms and also allows us to improve them. For detailed information on the cookies we use and the purposes for which we use them see our Cookies Page.
Other companies may also set and access cookies on your computer, for example, advertisers on the Platforms or providers of external services such as webs traffic analysis services.  We have no control over these third parties and their use of cookies is subject to their own privacy and cookie policies, not this one.  They do not have access to the data collected through the cookies we set.
Your Ability to Edit Your Account Information and Preferences
The OurFamilyWizard website gives you the ability to edit your OurFamilyWizard website account information and preferences at any time, including whether you want OurFamilyWizard to contact you about special promotions and new products.
Location
OurFamilyWizard provides you with the ability to attach geographical identification tags (longitude/latitude) to entries.  This functionality is called geotagging.  Geotagging makes user content more organized and searchable.  Geotagged entries are created at the users discretion and geotags are ONLY generated when a user affirmatively adds them to an entry.  If you do not want to use our geotagging features, you may simply opt not to use them or turn off the location services located in your browser preferences or in your device settings.
Security
Your OurFamilyWizard website Account Information is password protected for your privacy and security.
Because of the sensitivity of information stored on the OurFamilyWizard website, the OurFamilyWizard website uses not only industry standard SSL encryption to protect data transmissions, but also uses Transparent Data Encryption and Redaction to protect data during storage and access inside of our database.
Changes to this Privacy Policy
The OurFamilyWizard website may amend this policy from time to time. If we make any substantial changes in the way we use your personal information, we will notify you by posting a prominent announcement on our pages.
