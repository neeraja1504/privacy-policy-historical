As you browse the site, our Web servers collect information about your visit, not about you personally. Via Web server logs, we monitor statistics such as:
How many people visit our Web site.
Which pages people visit on our Web site.
From which domains our visitors come (e.g. "google.co.uk", "yahoo.com").
Which browsers people use to visit our Web site.
While we gather this information, none of it is associated with you as an individual. We use these statistics to improve our Web site, to monitor its performance, and to make it easier for you and other visitors to use.
We do occasionally use third parties to track and analyse the performance of our advertisements, as well as to provide advertisements that are tailored to your interests. As a result, you may see advertisements related to OpenCRM on other web sites.
These third parties collect this information using cookies to ensure these ads are accurately targeted.
If you would like to opt out of this tracking, you can do so by going to Google's Ads Settings and amending your preferences. Alternatively, you can also learn more about opting out of all third-party vendor tracking by going to the Network Advertising Initiative opt out page.
Within our Web site, you may be asked to give us personal or organisational information in order to receive information about a product or service. This information may range from your postcode to a specific phone number, email address, mailing address, organisation URL, product serial numbers and control codes, account number or credit card number.
Our Web site logs Host Names (or IP addresses when the Host Name is not available) for systems administration and security purposes. These logs are monitored and analysed to maintain systems and information security and allow us to constantly improve the value and the availability of the Web content.
We encourage all visitors to register on our Web site, though registration is only required to access premium content areas. The registration forms require users to give us accurate contact information (such as name and email address) and references that help us better serve you. Your name and email address may be used to send you information about our company, product updates, special offers and newsletters. To opt out of receiving communications, please contact us. We provide unsubscribe options on these emails.
Our order forms securely collect contact information and financial information (such as your billing information). Contact information on the order form is used for order fulfilment and may need to be shared with our Partners or Resellers if that is necessary to fulfil your order. The information that we require in our order form is only used to process your order quickly and accurately. Your contact information will only be used to send you the product that you purchase and your billing information will only be used to bill you for that product.
During the purchasing process, additional information may be added to your profile to make it easier for you to purchase products/services from us in the future. This may include order history and billing information. You may opt out of this feature at any time by changing your profile or cancelling an on-line account.
We do not store your credit card details within any OpenCRM or Software Add-ons system, however if you sign up to an OpenCRM subscription from this website (http://opencrm.co.uk) we use Stripe or PayPal as our payment gateway who also provide recurring subscription payment services and as part of their service they will hold details of the credit card that will be charged. This information is held securely and in accordance with their terms and conditions. Both organisations are fully PCI compliant.
