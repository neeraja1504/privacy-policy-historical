Privacy Policy
Welcome to Open Listings ("Open Listings, “OL”, " "we," "us" or "our"). Open Listings provides an easy way for you to follow updates to for sale properties listed on Multiple Listing Services and other available digital marketplaces.  Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share and protect information in relation to our Services as defined in Terms.  Your use of our Service is subject to this privacy policy, which is incorporated and made a part of our Terms always available at www.openlistings.com/legal/terms.
You understand by using our Services you acknowledge that we are providing a platform for you to post content, including photos, comments and other materials ("User Content"), to the Services and to share User Content publicly. This means that other Users may search for, see, use, or share any of your User Content that you make publicly available through the Services, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and our Terms at https://openlistings.com/legal/terms.
Because we’re always looking for new and innovative ways to provide you with new features and services, this Privacy Policy may change over time, but any future changes will not affect data that was collected under a previous version of the Privacy Policy. If any modifications substantially change your rights, we will send an email summarizing the changes to the address associated with your OL account and provide prominent notice here and on the homepage of our website.
And remember, we’re here to help. If something in this policy does not make sense or if you have any questions, please contact us at support@openlistings.com.
Our Privacy Policy applies to all visitors, authorized and registered users who access the Service ("Users") and applies to both personal and non-personal information as follows. We refer to Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”), when we specifically mean information that includes a personal identifier like your name, email or address, or information that could reasonably be linked back to you. When reference the term aggregated, or meta, or de-identified information, we mean information that does not identify or could not reasonably be linked back to you. We refer to both types of PII and non-PII data collectively as information below.
Here’s what we’ll cover:
1.  Information we collect.  We collect the following types of information.
1.1.  Information you provide us directly:
Your password and e-mail address when you register for an Open Listings account.
Profile information that you provide for your user profile (e.g., first and last name, picture). This information allows us to help you or others be "found" on Open Listings.
User Content (e.g., personal info, financial info, comments, and other materials) that you post to the Service. This includes messages and communications between users.
Communications between you and Open Listings. For example, we may send you Service-related emails (e.g., account verification, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). Note that you may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.
1.2.  Information provided by third-party organizations such as an MLS or Brokerage: Open Listings may obtain information (e.g. name, email address) about non-registered users from a third-party service or organization and invite them to register for a personal account. Invited users have the choice to not use or register for Open Listings and can unsubscribe from communications at any time.
1.3.  Inviting others to Open Listings: If you choose to invite someone to the Service, you may select a person directly from the contacts list on your device and send a text or email from your personal account. You understand and agree that you are responsible for any charges that apply to communications sent from your device, and because this invitation is coming directly from your personal account, Open Listings does not have access to or control this communication. Invited users have the choice to not use or register for Open Listings and can unsubscribe from communications at any time.
1.4. Analytics information: We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your device or our Service, including the web pages you visit, add-ons, and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this analytics information with analytics information from other Users so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify any particular individual User.
1.5.  Cookies and similar technologies: When you visit the Service, we may use cookies and similar technologies like pixels, web beacons, and local storage to collect information about how you use Open Listings and provide features to you. We may ask advertisers, third party vendors or other partners to serve ads or services to your devices, and in order to do so, such vendor may collect anonymous information about your visits to our website using a “cookie” or similar technologies placed by the third party or us. A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your browser or mobile device by websites, mobile apps, and advertisements that you access or use. This data is stored on your browser or mobile device and helps websites and mobile apps to remember things about you to improve your experience with the website. Third-party vendors may then pool the anonymous information that they collect from our website with other sources of information, which may include your name and mailing address, for purposes of determining whether you might be interested in receiving direct mail. To opt-out of receiving our direct mail, you may send us an email at support@openlistings.com or call us at (800) 501-2077.
1.6. Log file information: Your browser automatically reports Log file information each time you make a request to access (i.e., visit) a web page or app. It can also be provided when the content of the webpage or app is downloaded to your browser or device. When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information, including your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. We may also collect similar information from emails sent to our Users, which then help us, track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.
1.7. Device identifiers: When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Service, we may access, collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more "device identifiers." Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by Open Listings. A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how you browse and use the Service and may help others or us provide reports or personalized content and ads. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.
1.8.  Metadata: Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Content. For example, Metadata can describe how, when and by whom a piece of User Content was collected and how that content is formatted. Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content including a hashtag (e.g., to associate with a listing when you post a photo), comments or other data. This makes your User Content more searchable by others and more interactive.
1.9. Active Location Features. The OL Services includes features that require the collection of specific location data, including: GPS signals, device sensors, Wi-Fi access points, and cell tower IDs. We only collect this type of data when you activate a location feature, such as run mapping. We stop collecting this type of data when you deactivate the feature. We store this information in your OL account.  If you are using a partner or third party app or service, such as our mapping feature, we will send your location information to our mapping service provider so they can display your location on a map. They are contractually prevented from sharing or using this data for any other purpose.
2. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION:  In addition to some of the specific uses of information we describe in this Privacy Policy, we may use information that we receive to:
help you efficiently access your information after you sign in
remember information so you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Service;
help an Open Listings agent or the support team service you better
provide personalized content and information to you and others, which could include online ads or other forms of marketing
provide, improve, test, and monitor the effectiveness of our Service
