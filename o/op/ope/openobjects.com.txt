How long do we retain your personal information?
We may retain your personal data as long as you are registered to use the Site. You may close your account by either clicking on the opt-out link provided in one of our communications or email privacy@idoxgroup.com.
In some cases, there are legal requirements to keep personal data for a minimum period, for example if it must be retained by court or tribunal order or where Idox is under a contractual obligation to retain it. If there is no such legal requirement, Idox will only keep the personal data for so long as it is necessary for the purposes for which it was collected, or as expressly consented. If we no longer need your personal information, we will delete or de-identify it. Even if we delete your personal data, it may persist on backup or archival media for an additional period of time for legal, tax or regulatory reasons, or for legitimate and lawful business purposes.
We do not share or sell your personal information with any other organisation, and we won't pass on your details except when we need to do so in order to complete a transaction – e.g. when arranging for a courier company to deliver goods that you have ordered.
There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may disclose, transfer or share your personal data with certain third parties without further notice to you, which are as follow:
you have consented to the transfer/sharing of data;
the transferring/sharing of data is necessary for the performance of a contract;
the transferring/sharing of data is required under a legal obligation;
the transferring/sharing of data is necessary to protect your vital interests;
the transferring/sharing of data is necessary to carry out public functions (such as the administration of justice); or
the transferring/sharing of data is necessary to pursue the legitimate interests of the company or third parties (unless it could unjustifiably prejudice your interests).
Business transfers
As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganisation, dissolution or similar event, personal data may be part of the transferred assets. You acknowledge and agree that any successor to or acquirer of Idox Group (or its assets) will continue to have the right to use your personal data and other information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.
