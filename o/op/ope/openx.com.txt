Whenever you voluntarily post information to any public forum offered by OpenX, such information along with your user name can be accessed by other users of the forum, including members of the public if the forum is open to the public.

Interest-Based Advertising and Opting Out
OpenX adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) Self-Regulatory Principles in the US and to the European Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA) Principles in the European Union (“EU”) and the IAB Europe OBA Framework.
As discussed above, the Services use cookies, Web beacons, pixels, etags, and similar technologies to give Publishers the possibility to offer, and Demand Partners the ability to show, targeted ads on the device on which you are viewing this policy or a different device. These ads are more likely to be relevant to you because they are based on inferences drawn from location data, web viewing data collected across non-affiliated sites over time, and/or application use data collected across non-affiliated apps over time. This is called “interest-based advertising.” When we identify possible relationships among different browsers and devices, this is called “cross-device linking.” In addition, certain third parties may collect data on the OpenX website and combine this data with information collected from other websites over time for purposes that include interest-based advertising.
** Opting Out for Cookie-Based Services: If you would like to learn more about this type of advertising, or would prefer to opt out of website interest-based advertising enabled by the Services, European Economic Area (“EEA”) individuals may opt-out of this form of advertising by companies participating in the EDAA at www.youronlinechoices.com and all other users may visit www.aboutads.info/choices to opt out of this form of advertising by companies participating in the DAA self-regulatory program. Please note** that in order for your opt-out choice to be effective using this tool, you must ensure that your browser is set to accept third-party cookies such as the OpenX opt-out cookie. Some browsers block third-party cookies by default, and you may need to change your browser settings to accept third-party cookies before opting out.
** Opting Out for Certain Non-Cookie Services (in applicable countries):** To help identify your browser and/or possible relationships between different browsers and devices, OpenX or our partners may use the local storage or cache in your browser. Using the browser cache or local storage helps OpenX or our partners deliver interest-based advertising to a browser without the use of third-party cookies. To opt out of OpenX’s use of local storage or the browser cache to provide its services, please (1) use any tools provided by your browser to clear local storage and the browser cache, and (2) turn on any “Do Not Track” header setting offered by your browser. As long as the two steps are completed and maintained on a browser, OpenX will not use local storage or the cache on that browser to identify and sync browsers and devices. If you also want to opt out of OpenX’s use of third-party cookies for interest-based advertising enabled by OpenX’s Ad Exchange, please see instructions above.
** Opting Out for Mobile Application Data:** To opt out of OpenX’s collection, use, and transfer of data for interest-based advertising on mobile apps, you may download the DAA’s AppChoices application from the Android or iOS app store on your mobile device. Users outside the United States may not have access to this application; instead, you can use “Limit Ad Tracking” in your iOS settings or “Opt out of interest-based ads” in your Android settings to limit OpenX’s collection of data for interest-based advertising.
** Opting Out for Location Data:** You may opt out of our collection, use, and transfer of precise location data by using the location services controls in your mobile device’s settings.
** Opting Out for Television & Internet Connected Device Data**: Your Internet connected device (e.g. smart TV or a set up box) may give you the ability to opt out of the use of information for advertising purposes. To determine if your device has these options, please visit your device’s setting menus.
** Effect of Opting Out:** If you use a different device or browser, or erase cookies from your browser, you will need to renew your opt-out choice.
If you opt out of OpenX’s practices, you may continue to receive interest-based advertising through other companies. Publishers and Demand Partners that participate in the Ad Exchange may also use their own cookies and other ad service technologies to display and track their ads. We do not control and are not responsible for such Publishers’ and Demand Partners’ information practices or their use of cookies and other ad service technologies. To learn more about the practices of these companies, please read their privacy policies.
Even if you opt-out, OpenX may continue to collect data for other purposes and you still may receive advertising from the Ad Exchange when you visit websites of a Publisher who uses our Services – but such advertising will not be targeted to you.
Reviewing and Updating Information
OpenX takes reasonable steps to ensure that information is accurate, complete, current, and reliable for its intended use. For contact or billing information submitted through our website, you may review, correct, update, or change your information, request that we deactivate your account, or remove your information from our direct marketing efforts, at any time by e-mailing us at privacy@openx.com.

Your Rights Regarding Personal Information
California residents have certain rights with respect to the personal information collected by businesses.  If you are a California resident, you may exercise the following rights regarding your personal information, subject to certain exceptions and limitations:
The right to know the categories and specific pieces of personal information we collect, use, disclose, and sell about you, the categories of sources from which we collected your personal information, our purposes for collecting or selling your personal information, the categories of your personal information that we have either sold or disclosed for a business purpose, and the categories of third parties with which we have shared personal information.
The right to request that we delete the personal information we have collected from you or maintain about you.
The right to opt out of our sale(s) of your personal information.
To exercise any of the above rights, please click here and submit the verifying information.  Under the CCPA, you have a right not to receive discriminatory treatment when you exercise the above rights.
If you wish to opt out of the use of your personal information for interest-based advertising purposes, you may also do so by following the instructions under “Interest-Based Advertising and Opting Out” above. Note that because these opt outs are specific to the device or browser on which they are exercised, you will need to opt out on each browser and device.
** Verification Process and Required Information** : Because most of the information we store can only identify a particular browser or device, and cannot identify you individually, we may need to request additional information from you to verify your identity or understand the scope of your request. Such additional information may include your online identifier (i.e. cookie or mobile advertising ID) and some proof that the devices that have the cookie or mobile advertising ID you provide are yours, such as a screenshot of the applicable cookie or of a screen that displays the mobile advertising ID or other documentation that can verify you.
** Authorized Agent** : You may designate an authorized agent to make a CCPA request on your behalf by verifying your identity and providing written permission to your agent to make the request for you.
** Minors’ Right to Opt In :** We do not sell the personal information of consumers that we know to be under 16 years of age.
International Information Transfers
Please be aware that the information we collect, including contact and billing information, may be transferred to and maintained on servers or databases located outside your state, province, country, or other jurisdiction, where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your location. If you are located outside of the United States, please be advised that we process and store information in the United States and your consent to this Privacy Policy or use of OpenX Services represents your agreement to this processing.
** For EEA and Swiss Individuals.**
OpenX complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from EEA member countries and Switzerland, as that term is defined in the Privacy Shield Framework. OpenX has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability. If there is any conflict between the policies in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.

OpenX is accountable for information that it receives under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to a third party. OpenX transfers contact and billing information to third parties as described above in this Privacy Policy. Additionally, OpenX transfers other information which meets the definition of “personal data” in the Privacy Shield Framework to service providers and to OpenX’s customers such as Publishers and Demand Partners including for interest-based advertising as described above. In particular, OpenX is responsible under the Privacy Shield Principles if third-party controllers to whom it transfers information or third-party agents it engages to process this information on its behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles.
In cases of onward transfer to third parties of data of EEA or Swiss individuals received pursuant to the EU-US Privacy Shield or the Swiss-US Privacy Shield, respectively, OpenX is potentially responsible.
EEA and Swiss individuals have the right to access the personal information that OpenX maintains about you, as that term is defined in the Privacy Shield Framework, and you may be able to correct or amend that information if it is inaccurate or has been processed in violation of the Privacy Shield Principles, to the extent allowed by law.

Additional Information for EEA Individuals
For EEA individuals, the data controller in respect of your personal information is OpenX Ltd. Retention of personal information of EEA individuals will be handled in accordance with OpenX’s data retention policy.  As set out above, Publishers may use the Services to process data that they collect for their own purposes. In this respect we act as data processor for the Publisher, which may have its own Privacy Policy, which explains how it uses personal information.

**Legal Basis for Processing Personal Information of EEA Individuals  **
On certain occasions, OpenX relies on the consent of the individual to process personal information (for example, when the user inputs personal information into the OpenX website). On other occasions, OpenX may process personal information when OpenX needs to do this to fulfill a contract or where OpenX is required to do so by law.
OpenX may also process data when it is in OpenX’s or its customer’s legitimate interests to do this and when these interests are not overridden by the individual’s data protection rights (which may vary based on an individual’s jurisdiction). Those legitimate interests include improving OpenX’s Services.
