Privacy Policy - Cloudnine Weather
OUR PROMISE
Cloudnine Weather LLC ("Cloudnine Weather", "we", "our", or "us") respects your privacy and strives to earn and keep your trust.
This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect from all sources, including without limitation in connection with our websites, mobile sites, applications, widgets, and electronic newsletters or communications (collectively the "Services") that link to this Privacy Policy.
Questions regarding this policy and our practice should be directed to Cloudnine Weather, by email to hello@opensnow.com or hello@opensummit.com, or by postal mail to Cloudnine Weather, PO Box 1143, Boulder, CO 80306.
Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to our Terms of Use ("Terms"). It tells you what information we collect, how we protect it and what choices you have about how that information is used. Most information collected is to enable us to best meet the needs of our users, as sports participants, in a highly customized and responsive manner, however we may also use collected information for business reasons, such as analytics, evaluation of the Services, improvement of the Services, and other uses set forth herein.
Any capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meaning provided for such terms in the Terms.
Children's Privacy
Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, Cloudnine Weather does not knowingly collect or maintain personal information from persons under 13 years-of-age. If Cloudnine Weather learns that personal information of persons under 13-years-of-age has been collected on or through the Services, Cloudnine Weather will take the appropriate steps to delete this information. If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child under 13 who has become a registered user or subscriber of Cloudnine Weather or any of the Services or otherwise set up an Account, then please contact Cloudnine Weather at hello@opensnow.com or hello@opensummit.com to have that child's account terminated and personal information deleted.
Public Forum Discussions and Comments
Please note that any information that you reveal in a public forum (such as in the comments) will be seen by third parties not related to Cloudnine Weather and is therefore not subject to this privacy policy. All such information may be disclosed, used, or reproduced by Cloudnine Weather in accordance with our Terms.

California Residents -- Your California Privacy Rights
California's "Shine the Light" law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers asking about the business' practices related to disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. Alternately, businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose personal information of customers to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes if the customer has exercised an option to opt-out of such information-sharing. We have such a policy in place.
As discussed above in Your Privacy Choices, if you wish to opt-out of our sharing of your personal Information with third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes or to find out more about your opt-out rights, please contact Cloudnine Weather as described above.
