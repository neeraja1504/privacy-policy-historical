Part V. Online Data Collection Technologies
A cookie is a unique alphanumeric identifier that is used to identify unique visitors to a website, whether or not those visitors are repeat visitors, and the source of the visits. Cookies cannot be executed as code or used to deliver a virus. Cookies are used to help site administrators recognize visitors as unique visitors (just a number) when they return. For example, if there are 1,000 visits to a website on a certain day, the site operator can use cookies to discover how many of those visits were made via the same browser (same visitor) and to track whether a certain visitor has visited the site more than once, and the source for each visit.
A tracking pixel, also known as a web bug or web beacon, is a small graphic (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel) invisible to the eye, that is embedded in web content or email. When you view content that has an embedded web beacon, your web browser will request content from a web server, which in turn will set a cookie in your web browser containing a unique identifier. This unique identifier can be linked to log information that is used to track your movements on the operator’s website.
You may block cookies using the cookiebot feature available on our site. Your current cookie status and the link to change it appears in Section II above captioned “Third Parties Who Collect Data On Our Site.”
Part VI. Communications Policy

Part VIII. Security
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost or accessed in an unauthorized manner, including being altered or disclosed.
We have put in place procedures to handle security incidents, including a process for making notifications to you or a data breach as required by law.
We require our service providers to comply with appropriate security measures and to give us notice of security events as necessary for us to meet our security obligations to you.
Part IX. Data Retention
We will retain your personal data only for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purpose for which it was collected, and to comply with our legal obligations. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.
Please contact us at [email protected] if you would like more information about our data retention policies
Part X. Requests to amend or erase your personal data, or restrict our use of your personal data
Our policies for complying with your requests to amend, erase, restrict or take other action with respect to your personal data are stated below. We will comply with the applicable legal requirements for these types of requests. You should communicate your request to [email protected].
Request access  to your personal data. This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
Request correction  of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
Request erasure  of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law.
Object to processing  of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:
If you want us to establish the data's accuracy;
Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it;
Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims; or
You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
Request the transfer  of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
If your request under this section is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive, we may charge you a fee to comply, or we may refuse to comply with your request, to the extent permitted by applicable law. We may need to request additional information from you to confirm your identity and help us comply with your request. We will try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. If your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests, it may take us longer than a month. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated. There may be circumstances in which we believe our interest as the community manager requires us to retain your personal data despite your request, but we will disclose this to you at the time of the request. Those circumstances include the following:
* If you ask to have your individual member data removed, we may retain your name, email and OpenStack ID in a separate “deleted members” database. We will use this record only to track our compliance with your deletion request and to respond to any subsequent communications you may have with us;
* If you contribute code or documentation to the OpenStack Project we believe our legitimate interest as the manager of the OpenStack Project requires us to retain and publish your name in connection with that contribution indefinitely, even if you ask to you have your name removed.
Part XI. De-identified data
In some circumstances we may use or disclose de-identified data about our community members to third parties, including aggregate data, such as the size of our community, the demographic make-up of the community, the proportionate number of users vs. developers, and like information. Provided that we have de-identified this data in a way that it cannot be re-identified to any individual, we do not consider this type of information to be “personal data” subject to this policy.
Part XII. EU-US and Swiss Privacy Shield
The OpenStack Foundation participates in the EU-US and Swiss Privacy Shield frameworks regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. We have certified with the Department of Commerce that we adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles. To learn more about the Privacy Shield Principles, visit here. Our certification appears here.
In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, The OpenStack Foundation commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal information. EU individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield policy should first contact The OpenStack Foundation at [email protected] and give us the opportunity to resolve your complaint. We will respond to your complaint promptly.
The OpenStack Foundation has further committed to refer unresolved Privacy Shield complaints to Privacy Trust, an alternate dispute resolution provider located in the United States. If you do not receive timely acknowledgement of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit https://www.privacytrust.com/drs/openstack for more information or to raise a privacy shield complaint with PrivacyTrust. The services of Privacy Trust are provided at no cost to you.
In cases of onward transfer to third parties of data of EU individuals received pursuant to the EU-US Privacy Shield, OpenStack remains liable.
Finally, as a last resort and in limited situations, EU individuals may seek redress from the Privacy Shield Panel, a binding arbitration mechanism.
Please see the additional information provided by the U.S. Department of Commerce here on resolving complaints.
Part XIII. Changes to Policy
We may revise our Privacy Policy at any time by posting a revision on our website. However, the version of the Privacy Policy posted on our site at the time of the collection of your personal data will continue to apply to the personal data collected while that version was published.
