**Controlling Your Personal Information  **
Personal information is information that can identify a person, such as name, address, telephone number, and email address.
We strive for accurate, respectful and relevant communications with our constituents. We occasionally exchange mailing addresses with select non-profit groups. We will not sell, rent or share your email address or telephone number. If you would like to correct or update your personal information, modify your mailing preferences, or if you do not wish to participate in mailing address exchange activities, please call 1-888-OPSMILE (1-888-677-6453) or email drelations@operationsmile.org.
Unsubscribing from specific communications by writing, phoning or emailing us. Please also understand marketing campaigns are scheduled in advance so while we will remove you from the mailing list in a timely manner, you may still receive materials from campaigns which were in process prior to your request to be removed for up to 90 days.
We respect your time and attention by controlling the frequency of our emails. However, you may modify your email preferences at any time. Each email sent contains an easy, automated way for you to change your expressed interests, or to cease receiving email from us altogether. If you would like to modify your preferences, simply follow the instructions at the end of any email you receive from us, contact us directly or visit your online account page http://ww2.operationsmile.org/account/.
You have the right to request us to update your personal information in the event it is incorrect or out dated. You can do this by contacting drelations@operationsmile.org or calling 1-888-OPSMILE (1- 888-677-6453).
**Third Party Requests To Change Data  **
Except in exceptional circumstances (as outlined in this process) requests to change user information including changes to direct debits, standing orders or any other kind of donation, can only be authorized by the user. We can only take instructions from a third party with the express consent of the user or on evidence of the relevant power of attorney. This is to safeguard the interests of the user with whom we have a relationship.
A request by a third party to remove a user from our mailing list or change mailing preferences may be considered exceptionally if we are convinced the third party is acting in the best interests of the user. This may be a judgment based on the user’s history of giving, any unusual changes in the level of their giving or frequency of giving and any communication we have had with the user regarding their gifts or mailing preferences. Any direct communication from the user (verbal or written) which gives concern that the user may lack capacity to make a sound decision and/or judgment could be taken as support on this. In this context our telemarketing agencies who call on our behalf in fundraising campaigns record conversations with prospective users and where there is a concern relating to mental capacity these recordings could be used by Operation Smile for final decision making.
Is my Information Secure?
Keeping your personal information secure is a top priority for Operation Smile. Personal information is private and confidential; accordingly, the information provided is stored in a secure location, is accessible only by designated employees, trained in the proper handling of customer information, and is used only for the purpose for which the information is collected.
We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling donation receipts and sending postal mail and e-mail, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. Whenever Operation Smile should hire other organizations to provide support services, we will require them to conform to our privacy standards and allow us to audit them for compliance.
Credit Card Information Security
At Operation Smile, we sincerely care about the safety and security of your transaction. We use high grade encryption and the HTTPS security protocol to communicate with your browser software.

Social Media Policy
We encourage staff, volunteers and guests to share their medical mission experiences with friends, family and supporters to educate and raise awareness about our organization; please feel free to tag Operation Smile and Operation Smile Student Programs in your posts. We also request that you share stories with us at socialmedia@operationsmile.org. Please keep in mind that what you say online about your medical mission experience represents Operation Smile. Above all else, we ask that you respect the privacy and dignity of our patients. Your posts should not be discriminatory, offensive, hateful, defamatory or otherwise illegal. Your posts should be culturally sensitive.
*Our Policies  **
Any photo or video you produce will occur with little to no interruption of the medical program.
Do not use copyrighted music in any video or post you publish. Do not use content you create or edit to promote other organizations or companies.
Do not post information about unapproved Operation Smile projects or future projects in development.
Please refer to our style guide and talking points for more information on how we talk about Operation Smile at: http://brand.operationsmile.org
**Our Patients' Dignity  **
To uphold Operation Smile’s proprietary information and respect the privacy of our patients, please:
Obtain verbal consent prior to capturing images of patients, volunteers or Operation Smile staff, and be clear about the way that you will be using their image and information.
Do not publish patients’ personal information, including their last names.
Do not publish images of patients who look uncomfortable, frightened or in pain.
Do not publish images of patients who are having their blood drawn, being intubated or extubated, or who have blood around their stitching, face and or medical gown.
Do not post PIT photos. These are photos intended for medical records.
Do not post immediate post-operative photos of patients.
Be respectful of patients who are undergoing anesthesia or who are waking up from anesthesia.
Be respectful of patients who are partially clothed or unclothed.
Be mindful of the words used in your post. Do not refer to a patient as a “cleft patient.” Say instead, “a patient born with a cleft condition” or something similar. In posts, do not refer to their cleft condition as a “deformity”; while this may be a medical term, our patients have told us they do not appreciate this word being used casually.
Do not publish images of patients who have poor lip revision scars. Often, these patients did not receive surgical care from our medical teams, and without the proper context, this could be a poor reflection of our work.
Do not criticize the work of other surgical organizations.
**Your Safety  **
Do not post political views or discuss political issues within the host country.
Do not post your travel itinerary.
Do not post the personal opinions of other Operation Smile staff or volunteers.
Do not post inappropriate photos of yourself, team members or patients that may be perceived as unprofessional, culturally insensitive or offensive, or violating a patient's right to privacy.
Do check-in during emergency situations.
