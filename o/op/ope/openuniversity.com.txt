Use of cookies and your privacy
A cookie is a small data file. Cookies cannot read your hard disk or make any information collected by use of a cookie available to any third party. A cookie can only be read by the organisation that installs it.
This website stores cookies on your computer to track user traffic patterns. We do this in order to determine the usefulness of our website and to see how effective our navigational structure is. We do not release this information to third parties.
If you prefer not to receive cookies while browsing our website, you can set your browser to refuse all cookies that are stored on your computer.

Cookies we use for marketing purposes
We use advertising related cookies on our site.
DoubleClick uses cookie IDs to show adverts relevant to a visitors interests and browsing behaviour. They are also used to limit the number of times someone sees an advert, as well as helping to measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns. They remember that a browser visited a website and this information is shared with other organisations such as advertisers. Cookie IDs also allow DoubleClick to log conversions related to ad requests. DoubleClick cookies do not collect any personally identifiable information about the internet user. Sometimes the cookie contains an additional identifier that is similar in appearance to the cookie ID. This identifier is used to identify an ad campaign to which a user was exposed previously; but no personally identifiable information is stored by DoubleClick in the cookie.
If you would like to learn more about how advertisers use these types of cookies or to choose not to receive them, please visit the your online choices website.
