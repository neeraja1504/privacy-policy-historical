We may pass your information to our third party service providers, agents subcontractors and other associated organisations for the purposes of completing tasks and providing services to you on our behalf. However, when we use third party service providers, we disclose only the personal information that is necessary to deliver the service and we have a contract in place that requires them to keep your information secure and not to use it for their own direct marketing purposes.

We work closely with various third party service or product providers to bring you a range of quality and reliable products and services designed to meet the needs of the Embedded Systems designers and manufacturers. When you enquire about or purchase one or more of these products or services, the relevant third party product or service provider will use your details to provide you with information and carry out their obligations arising from any contracts you have entered into with them.

These third party product providers will share your information with us which we will use in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Business evolution
We may transfer your personal information to a third party as part of a sale of some or all of our business and assets to any third party or as part of any business restructuring or reorganisation, or if we’re under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation or to enforce or apply our terms of use or to protect the rights, property or safety of our supporters and customers.

How you can access and update your information
The accuracy of your information is important to us. You can access all information retained about you by editing your profile on the OpenSTM32.org website.
Should you want to delete this information, just delete your account on OpenSTM32.org and this will automatically delete all personal information we retain about you. Note however that posts you have done on the OpenSTM32 forums will still be available and labeled by the pseudo (login name) you have used when creating your account, so you should not use a sensible information for this.
Security precautions in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of your information
When you give us personal information, we take steps to ensure that it’s treated securely. However we do not retain sensitive information so all information is currently saved and displayed in clear form, at the exception of your password for which we only store a secure hash allowing to verify your password but not to retrieve it.
Non-sensitive details (your email address etc.) are transmitted normally over the Internet, and this can never be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your information, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. Where we have given (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our websites, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone.

We may analyse your personal information to create a profile of your interests and preferences so that we can contact you with information relevant to you. We may make use of additional information about you when it is available from external sources to help us do this effectively.
We may also use your personal information to detect and reduce the risk of abuse of our web site facilities (spamming the forums for example). In case we detect such abuse we reserve the right to immediately close your account; However in this case we may retain some personal information (like your email or IP address) to help us prevent further such attempts of abusing uour website facilities.
