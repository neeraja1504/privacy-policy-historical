We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you place an order or enter, submit, or access your personal information.
We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our payment gateway providers’ database, only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, who are required to keep the information confidential.
Unfortunately, no transmission of data over the Internet, and no system for storage of physical data, is guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be possible for hackers or other third parties not under the control of Opening Ceremony to intercept or access private communications unlawfully. While we strive to protect your personal information, Opening Ceremony cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit or otherwise provide to us. Any transmission or other provision of information is done at your own risk.
Do we use cookies, web beacons or other tracking technologies?
Yes. Our Website may use cookies (which are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer/hard drive through your web browser that enables the site’s or service provider’s system to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information), web beacons (which are used to transmit information back to a web server), or other tracking technologies, to improve and personalize the Website, as permitted under applicable law. For example, use of cookies helps us remember your password, and process requests you make through the Website.
We may also work with third parties (such as Google Analytics) that use cookies, web beacons or other tracking technology to collect information about your visits to the Website and/or other websites, and to serve advertisements to you based on that information. In particular, we may use third party cookies for the purpose of retargeting advertisements, meaning that after you visit our Website, you may receive future advertisements based on your activity on our Website. The majority of web browsers accept cookies, but the “help” menu on your browser should give you options for preventing, accepting, or receiving notice of cookies should you wish to do so.

Do we disclose your personal identifiable information to outside parties?
We may share your personally identifiable information with trusted third parties who assist us in operating the Website, providing the Services, conducting our business, or servicing you, or to our affiliates or agents, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. Examples include fulfilling requests for Services, delivering packages, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. We also may share your personally identifiable information with affiliated businesses that we do not control but with which we engage in joint and co-branded offerings, and entities with which Opening Ceremony may merge or which may acquire all or substantially all of Opening Ceremony’s assets, as customer information likely will be one of the transferred assets.
