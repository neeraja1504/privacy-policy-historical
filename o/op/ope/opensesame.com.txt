Cookies.  OpenSesame may use “cookies” to recognize and count new visitors and to acquire Aggregate Information that lets OpenSesame analyze traffic patterns and tune the performance and functionality of the Site.  A cookie is a file that is placed on your hard drive when you visit a web site.  It contains specific information that allows the Site to “recognize” your computer the next time you visit.  The most important use for cookies is to eliminate the need for you to re-enter your information every time you visit the Site.  Most browsers accept cookies by default, but you can turn off cookies using your browser settings.  To learn how, see: for Microsoft Internet Explorer users, www.microsoft.com/info/cookies.htm; for Firefox users, http://mozilla.gunnars.net/firefox_help_firefox_cookie_tutorial.html.  If you turn off cookies, certain Site features may no longer work or may work differently.  Please note that when you accept a cookie from the Site, OpenSesame does not gain access to your hard drive or personal information other than the information you have provided to us.  OpenSesame does not provide cookie information to any third party.

Business Transition.  In the event OpenSesame goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company or a sale of a portion of OpenSesame’s assets, our customers’ Personal Information may be part of the assets transferred.  Disclosure of users’ Personal Information in such a situation, or in contemplation of such a situation, shall be deemed consistent with this Policy.  However, such a transfer may result in a change in this Policy, and you are advised and strongly encouraged to review this Policy frequently.
