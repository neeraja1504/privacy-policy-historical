Additionally, if you are located in the EEA, we are generally processing your information in order to fulfill contracts we might have with you, such as an order through the Services for a merchant restaurant, or otherwise to pursue our legitimate business interests listed above, unless we are required by law to obtain your consent for a particular processing operation.

When we process personal information to pursue these legitimate interests, we do so where we believe the nature of the processing, the information being processed, and the technical and organizational measures employed to protect that information can help mitigate the risks to the data subject.
