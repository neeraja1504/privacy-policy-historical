Use of Kinesis Software by Licensees-Protection of Data by Kinesis
Kinesis Survey Technologies, LLC licenses software to businesses that conduct market research on consumers and business decision makers. The Kinesis software provides the researcher with tools to program and deploy online and mobile surveys and provides the tools necessary to build, maintain, and reward panels of individual participants.
The companies that license the Kinesis software can program and deploy online and mobile surveys and manage online panels. They invite individuals to give their opinions on a wide variety of research subjects. The invitees may come from an established research panel, a customer list, a purchased email list, banner ads, or other recruiting methods. Personal data such as name, email and physical address, age, gender, profession, income, and other demographic data are often collected in order to support research conclusions about certain subsets of survey respondents and to be able to fulfill rewards for participation that are often a part of the research process.
The Kinesis software is most often hosted in the US at a secure data center in Austin, TX. Kinesis Survey Technologies LLC has arranged for this hosting as part of the service customers receive when licensing Kinesis software. Therefore, EU citizens that participate in research panels and surveys prepared and managed by companies that license Kinesis software may have personal data stored on servers located in the US at the Austin, TX data center.
When licensees deploy surveys and panels we will not access or allow unauthorized access to licensee created data or provide it to any third parties unless specifically requested by the licensee or required to by law.
Kinesis Survey Technologies LLC utilizes a PCI level 1 compliant with SAS70 type 2 certification data center and extensive hardware and managerial procedures to protect from unauthorized access, copying, manipulation, or forwarding of data stored on our servers. We require our licensees to comply with CAN-SPAM and other professional standards when using Kinesis services and software. Kinesis Survey Technologies LLC reserves the right to suspend access should it come to our attention that a licensee is violating US or other country privacy or other laws of which we are aware (such as EU safe harbor principals) in its use of Kinesis software. Kinesis Survey Technologies LLC cannot be held responsible should it not discover or become aware that its software use by a licensee may violate US or other country laws.
