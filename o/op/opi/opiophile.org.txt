opiophile.org privacy notice
[ BACK ]
opiophile.org is a strong supporter of individual privacy and we will do everything we can to safeguard information about our visitors, contributors, and members.  ** opiophile.org** does not, and will not in the future, sell, rent, loan, trade, or lease any personal information collected at our site, including membership forms or email lists.
Visitors
As with almost all websites, temporary logs are kept which identify some information about our visitors, including the IP addresses of machines being used to access the site. Our web logs are not available to the public. These logs allow website administrators to see how many people visit the site, how many pages have been accessed, which pages are accessed most frequently, and what links are leading people to the site.
Standard logs (including ours) also track which pages are visited by each IP address. This information is important for us to have because it allows us to catch denial of service attacks (for example, individual IPs accessing hundreds of pages per day). This is obviously an area which concerns people and we take great care to make sure this information can not be used to compromise the privacy and security of our visitors.
You may also notice that only the title of each thread, and not the thread itself, is made public to those who are unregistered.  This is to give certain search engines the ability to categorize us in their listings, without compromising the privacy of our users.  Only upon full registration, acceptance of user agreement, and verification of email address may a person view a thread (both thread and thread title) or the list of members and member details.
Members / Contributors
Information collected about members (such as name, email address, physical address, and/or credit card information) will never be shared with anyone. We do not share mailing lists with any other organizations. Additionally, there are a number of ways to make   contributions.
Removal of Identifying Information
If you have previously submitted information to  ** opiophile.org** and would like to have your name or contact information removed from the submission, please let us know via our  contact form and we will address the situation ASAP.
