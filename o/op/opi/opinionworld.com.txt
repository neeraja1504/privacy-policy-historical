Last Updated : February 29th, 2016
Survey Sampling International, LLC and its parent, subsidiary and affiliated companies (collectively “ SSI ”) provide sampling solutions and technology for survey research, providing clients with access to consumer and business-to-business respondents via internet, telephone (both fixed/landline and wireless/mobile), postal and multi-mode methodologies. SSI serves a vast array of for-profit and not-for profit businesses, universities and governmental agencies and departments. This Privacy Policy sets forth the collection, use and disclosure of personal data or personally identifiable information (“ PII ”) and other information by SSI in connection with SSI’s Services (as defined herein). SSI’s Services provide you with the opportunity to join a panel, participate in surveys administered by SSI or by third parties (whether as a panel member or a non-panel member), use the websites associated with the panels, and receive and redeem rewards and incentives, including, without limitation, sweepstakes entries, offered in connection with panel membership and/or the completion of surveys (collectively “ Services ”). Surveys administered by third parties and the data collected in connection therewith are not subject to this Privacy Policy. Registration with, use of, and access to SSI’s Services is subject to SSI’s Terms and Conditions.  Your use of SSI’s Services is completely voluntary and therefore SSI’s processing of your PII in connection with the Services and this Privacy Policy is with your consent. SSI strives to conform its privacy practices to applicable laws, codes, and regulations, and the codes of standards of applicable market and opinion survey research associations, including, without limitation, CASRO and ESOMAR. For clarification, except for panels that have a separate privacy policy, this Privacy Policy applies to all of SSI’s survey research panels. In most cases SSI is not the sponsor of the survey and the survey instrument, and the survey results or survey data, are and will be owned by the sponsor of the survey.  All references in this Privacy Policy to “SSI” include SSI and its parent, subsidiary and affiliated companies. All references to “us” or “we” refer to SSI.
All PII is stored on servers located in the United States, where SSI’s servers are located. If you reside outside of the United States, your personal information will be transferred and exported to the United States and by agreeing to this Privacy Policy, you consent to SSI transferring and exporting your information, including, without limitation personal data and sensitive personal data, to the United States. SSI complies with the United States (“ US ”) - European Union (“ EU ”) and US – Switzerland Safe Harbor Frameworks as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data from EU member countries and Switzerland. SSI has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view SSI’s certification page, please visit http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/.
For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, the term “PII” shall include, without limitation, your name, address(es), telephone number(s) (including home, cell, and/or business telephone numbers), email address(es), date of birth, the unique identification number we assign to you (individually a “ UID ” and collectively “ UIDs ”)”), reward, loyalty, or incentive account numbers and Sensitive Data (as defined herein).
What information is collected by SSI, how is PII collected, and how is it used?
1. Information You Submit

Sensitive Data is used to target survey opportunities to you. By way of clarification, by voluntarily disclosing Sensitive Data to SSI you expressly consent to the transfer and exporting of Sensitive Data by SSI to the United States for storage and processing.
SSI collects PII and demographic information from non-panel members prior to and during participation in a survey.
You may submit, upload or transmit content or material, including, without limitation, photos, videos and/or any other similar or related content or material (“ User Content ”). If you submit User Content in connection with SSI’s Services (e.g., in connection with a client survey), the User Content may become publicly available and may be shared with third parties including, without limitation, SSI’s clients, clients of SSI’s clients and third party service providers. User Content should only include audio, video, images, or the likeness of the individual submitting the User Content and should not contain copyrighted or trademarked content or material of any third party. User Content should not include audio, video, images, or the likeness of anyone other than the user and should not contain any PII of or about anyone other than the user. If you would like information about the identity of the sponsor of a survey in which you submit photos or videos, please contact SSI as set forth in this Privacy Policy. In order to identify the specific survey, you will need to provide SSI with your email address and information on the specific survey (e.g., survey number, survey topic or subject matter, date you completed the survey, etc.).

Re-Targeting
SSI may from time-to-time engage a third party or third parties to either display advertising on an SSI website(s) or to manage SSI’s advertising on other websites (for example on social media sites). SSI’s third party partner(s) may use technologies such as cookies or identifying data elements to gather information about your activities on SSI’s website(s) and/or on other websites in order to: (i) provide you with advertising about SSI and its services and/or (ii) assist SSI in developing marketing and advertising campaigns designed to target individuals who have a social and demographic profile similar to your social and demographic profile. If SSI is conducting a re-targeting program and you wish to not participate in this re-targeting program, please opt-out via the applicable cookie opt-out process set forth in this Privacy Policy or in SSI’s separate cookie notice, or by unsubscribing within the advertisement itself. Please note that opting-out as described in this Privacy Policy does not opt you out of being served advertisements and you will continue to receive generic advertisements.
SSI’s Online Ad Effectiveness Program.
In connection with SSI’s online ad effectiveness program, you can participate in surveys regarding specific ads and promotions that SSI is testing for its clients. To facilitate the completion of these surveys, SSI’s clients may write, set, or read cookies, locally shared/stored objects, flash cookies and/or any other related technology (each a “ Third Party Technology ” and collectively the “ Third Party Technologies ”). The Third Party Technologies may be written, set or read in various locations, including, without limitation, SSI’s servers or systems. If you participate, your UID will be stored in or associated with the Third Party Technology to allow you to be re-contacted about the online ad or promotion and SSI’s client will use the Third Party Technology to determine whether you have seen, clicked on, or otherwise interacted with the online ad or promotion. If you have interacted with the online ad or promotion, SSI’s client will send your UID and the specific survey to SSI and SSI will provide you with the opportunity to complete the survey. Additionally, if you participate, SSI may share your UID and data previously collected by SSI, including, without limitation, age, gender, income, number of people in your household, education/education level, and employment status, (“ Audience Measurement Data ”), to third parties, including, without limitation, SSI’s subcontractors, partners, and/or clients for the purpose of audience measurement reporting on the advertisements, campaigns, and websites that you visit, view, and/or click on. The Audience Measurement Data will be used to assist in the creation, development, and implementation of websites, online advertisements, and other Internet and digital media features, functionality, and campaigns. Audience Measurement Data may be shared in a single summary form (i.e. individual respondent level) or aggregate summary form (i.e. group of respondents). In connection with SSI’s online ad effectiveness program, cookies and/or other similar technology, and device identifiers (e.g., IDFAs, AAIDs, etc.) may be used for the purpose of targeting advertisements to individuals.
**If you live outside of the EU and you have not previously agreed to participate in the Online Ad Effectiveness Program, as of the Effective Date of this Privacy Policy, you hereby consent to participate.  **
