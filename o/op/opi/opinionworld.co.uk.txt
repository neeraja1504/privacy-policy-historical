SSI serves a vast array of for-profit and not-for profit businesses, universities and governmental agencies and departments. This Privacy Policy sets forth the collection, use and disclosure of personal data or personally identifiable information ("PII") and other information by SSI in connection with SSI's Services (as defined herein).

Registration with, use of, and access to SSI's Services is subject to SSI's Terms and Conditions. Your use of SSI's Services is completely voluntary and therefore SSI's processing of your PII in connection with the Services and this Privacy Policy is with your consent. SSI strives to ensure that its privacy practices conform to applicable laws, codes and regulations, and the codes of standards of applicable market and opinion survey research associations, including, without limitation, CASRO and ESOMAR.

If SSI became aware that it had inadvertently collected PII from anyone under such age thresholds, SSI would promptly delete such PII. For example, in the United States, SSI's Services are not designed or intended for use by any individual under the age of thirteen (13) and SSI does not knowingly collect PII from anyone under the age of thirteen (13).
