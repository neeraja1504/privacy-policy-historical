Under the General Regulation (EU) 2016/679, of 27 April 2016, on Data Protection ( GDPR ), the following rights are recognised in relation to the processing of your personal data:
Right of access. You have the right to confirm that your personal data is being processed and, if the case, to get a copy of such data and complete information about the processing.
