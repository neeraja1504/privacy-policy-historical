Privacy Policy | Opower
Opower has beenacquired by Oracle and will soon transition to the Oracle Privacy Policy. Click here to view the Oracle Privacy Policy.  Please note that the provisions of Opower’s Privacy Policy below will remain active until the policy transition is complete.
OPOWER, Inc. (“ Opower ,” “ we ,” “ us ,” or “ our ”) has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our commitment to you, our user (“ You ” or “ Your ”), regarding Your privacy with respect to information that You submit to Opower by or through the Site or Services (defined below).
Scope of this Privacy Statement We partner with utility companies and their designees (each, a “ Utility ”) to promote energy efficiency to the Utility’s customers. You may be a Utility customer, an employee of a Utility using the Site or Services in your capacity as an employee or a visitor to the site who is neither a customer nor employee of a Utility (in each case, individually, a “ User ,” and collectively, as “ Users ”).
This Privacy Statement applies to opower.com (“ opower.com ”), including all portions of opower.com where Utility customers can obtain services from Opower (the “ Site ”).  Because we gather information from Users of the Site and related services offered through the Site provided by Opower (the “ Services ”), we have established this Privacy Statement as a means to communicate our information gathering, use and dissemination practices.  In order to access and use the Site and/or Services, You must agree to our Terms of Use posted on the applicable Site.  Any capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Statement are defined in the Terms of Use.
In addition to the Services we provide directly to You, we may also serve as a service provider for certain Utilities via a number of different Web sites and/or subdomains, through which those Utilities provide certain online and offline services to their end users (“ Utility Services ”), and Opower assists them in such provision, including the collection, use and dissemination of data and information from those customers.  These companies have entered into separate written agreements with Opower governing those services provided by Opower. This Privacy Statement does not apply to those Utility Services.  In each case, it is the Utility providing the Utility Services, not Opower. In those cases, the Utility, not Opower, is responsible for the collection, use and dissemination of any data or personal information provided by, or obtained from, end users of these Utilities and Utility Services, and it is the Utility’s privacy policy, not this Privacy Statement, that will apply with respect to such data and information. As a result, this Privacy Statement does not apply to or restrict our use of information that we receive from your Utility or that we collect from any third party on behalf of Your Utility.
We consider the phrase “ Personal Information ” to mean any information or combination of information that is used or intended to be used to identify a discrete Individual, and any other non-public information that is associated with that information.  “ Anonymous Information ” means information that is not associated with or linked to Your Personal Information, and is not used or intended to be used to personally identify an individual.
BY USING OUR SITE OR SERVICES OR SUBMITTING PERSONAL INFORMATION THROUGH OUR SITE OR SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT AND YOU EXPRESSLY CONSENT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION ACCORDING TO THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT.   YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE PROCESSED BY US OR ON OUR BEHALF IN THE COUNTRY WHERE IT WAS COLLECTED AS WELL AS OTHER COUNTRIES (INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES) WHERE LAWS REGARDING PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE LESS STRINGENT THAN THE LAWS IN YOUR COUNTRY.
E.U. Safe Harbor and TRUSTe Certification
Opower complies with the U.S.-E.U. Safe Harbor Principles as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, transfer, and retention of personal data from the European Union.

As part of our participation in the EU Safe Harbor Framework, Opower has agreed to TRUSTe dispute resolution for disputes relating to our compliance with it.  If you have questions or complaints regarding our privacy policy or practices, please contact us at Opower, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 1515 North Courthouse Rd., Eighth Floor, Arlington, VA 22201 or privacy@opower.com.  If you are not satisfied with our response you can contact TRUSTe here.

Collected Information Should You choose to provide us with Personal Information, we will treat such information in accordance with this Privacy Statement. The Personal Information we gather from You helps us learn more about, and provide You with, access to the Site or Services. We collect Personal Information that You submit to us voluntarily in the course of correspondence, registration and as otherwise identified below. We primarily collect this information to provide Services to You, including Services we provide in conjunction with Your Utility.
To register for certain Services offered on our Site, You may be required to provide certain Personal Information, including Your name, Utility account number and e-mail address.

You are not required to provide this information, but we may not be able to provide certain Services without this information. We may associate this information with Your Personal Information, making it also Personal Information.  Additionally, when You send us a communication, or fill out a request form such as a survey, we will collect all information contained therein.  We do not request Users to submit social security numbers through the Site or Services, and You should not submit this information to us, to other Users or to any third party, through the Site or Services.

If You do this, you may submit information and your résumé directly to us through the Site, and You may also enable us to collect Personal Information about You from third party Web sites such as LinkedIn. When you use such Web sites or certain similar services to apply for a job, you will have the option to post information about your activities on this Web site to your profile page to share with others within your network.

An “ Internet protocol address ” or “ IP Address ” is a number that is automatically assigned to Your computer when You use the Internet.  In some cases Your IP Address stays the same from browser session to browser session; but if You use a consumer internet access provider, Your IP Address probably varies from session to session.  We, or our service providers, may track Your IP Address when You access the Site or Services.

We do not store any Personal Information in the Cookies. Browsers are usually set to accept Cookies. However, if You would prefer not to receive cookies, You may alter the configuration of Your browser to refuse Cookies.

These Co-Branded Sites provide services to You by us and Your Utility. Both this Privacy Statement and the Utility’s privacy policy govern information collected on Co-Branded Sites. Please be aware that when we collect information on the Co-Branded Sites, that information will be considered to be collected by both us and Your Utility. While this Privacy Statement governs our use and disclosure of that information, You should be aware that Your Utility may have different practices, and all such information may be used and disclosed by Your Utility in accordance with their own privacy policy.
