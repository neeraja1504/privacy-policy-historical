Privacy Policy | Op4G | Opinions 4 Good
Effective Date: 4/1/2015 | Home >> Terms of Use
This privacy policy applies to op4g.com owned and operated by Op4G. This privacy policy describes how Op4G collects and uses the personal information you provide on our web sites: op4g.com, opinions4good.com, and myop4g.com.  It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information.
Op4G has received TRUSTe’s Privacy Seal signifying that this privacy statement and our practices have been reviewed for compliance with the TRUSTe program, viewable on the validation page available by clicking the TRUSTe seal. The TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through the Web sites and subdomains at op4g.com and myop4g.com.
If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that Op4G have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact TRUSTe here.
Security is the key to our shared success. Each element of Op4G is designed to fiercely protect our Members’ privacy and information. We make no distinction between “personal” and “non-personal” information — we protect both equally. And we are 100% transparent with our Members about our policies, their data, and how to safely leave our programs.
Any information conveyed to our Clients is on an anonymous basis, unless specifically approved by a Member through a proactive, opt-in choice.

We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy.  We do not sell your personal information to third parties.
We may provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities such as sending you newsletters. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.
We may also disclose your personal information:
as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process
when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request,
if Op4G is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets,  you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information,
to any other third party with your prior consent to do so
Clients are not permitted to directly contact the Op4G membership without company approval. Members’ personal information will never be released to an outside source, except as outlined in our privacy policy or unless legally required as defined in the Op4G privacy policy.
Clients are only permitted to interact directly with the Op4G membership through approved and member consented activities. All other Member communications will be through Op4G.
How do Clients contact Members if follow up is required?
Op4G will oversee and approve all Member and Client communication from start to finish. If a Client requires Member-specific follow up, the member will be notified in the survey invitation if sharing any personal information will be required or optional for participation in the study.
Secure Databases
Op4G stores personal and survey data in two physically separate server environments. Our data architecture is designed to never allow any Client or third party access to individual member data, or to correlate any data that might identify a participant.
When you enter sensitive information (such as health information) on our forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
Member Usernames
Members are assigned a non-traceable unique Op4G username that allows only Op4G to certify the authenticity of information we send to our Clients. Our system is built to prevent the revealing of any individual identity.
User Access and Choice
If your personal information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, or amend it by making the change on your account information page or by emailing us at support@op4g.com.  We will respond to your request to access within 30 days.
One-Click Account Termination
Want to leave Op4G? A single step of clicking ‘Delete My Account’ on your Account Profile will remove all personal, demographic, and member information from our databases (except for information required by law).
We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services.  We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
Opt-In Control
Members have total control over what information they receive from Non-Profits. When offered an opportunity to participate in a specific survey opportunity, Members always opt-in and will never be forced to answer or reveal information. If you participate, we will request certain personal information from you. The requested information typically includes information (such as name, age, gender, preferences) and demographic information (such as zip code).
We use this information to __ provide insights into client funded studies associated with a variety of topics.
If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter(s), we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you.  Out of respect for your privacy, you may choose to stop receiving our newsletter or marketing emails by following the unsubscribe instructions included in these emails, accessing the email preferences in your account settings page or you can contact us at support@op4g.com.
