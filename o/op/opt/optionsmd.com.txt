Privacy Policy | Trading Concepts, Inc.
Your privacy is very important to us. We want to make your experience on the Internet as enjoyable and profitable as possible and want you to use the services and products we offer with complete confidence.
We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our commitment to privacy and security. This Privacy Policy describes how our company collects information from all the people who use our Internet services (the Services). Those who visit our site and may access some our Services without having accounts with us (Visitors) as well as those who purchase Products and pay a fee to subscribe to our Services (Members). It also sets out what we do with the information we collect and the choices Visitors and Members have concerning the collection and use of this information. We ask that you read this Privacy Policy carefully.
Personal Information Our Company
Collects And How It Is Used
Introduction Our company collects information in different ways from Visitors and Members who access the various parts of our Services on this or related web sites. We use this information mainly to provide a personalized experience as you use our Products and Services and generally do not share this information with third parties.
However, we may disclose personal information collected, if we have received your prior permission, or in very special circumstances as when we believe disclosure is required by law and in the special cases described below.
Upon Registration Members may be asked to provide certain personal information when they sign up for our free content and Products and Services including name, address, telephone number, billing information, (such as credit card number), and the type of personal computer being used to access the Services. Personal information collected from Members during the registration process is used to manage each Memberâ€™s account (such as for billing purposes.Â By providing your email address, you give and agree that you give explicit consent to receive commercial emails from Trading Concepts, whether sent directly from our own databases, a third-party sending an email on our behalf, or from any representative of our company. You may revoke this consent at any time by opting out of our communications. This information is not shared with third parties, except as specifically stated, as a way to facilitate an email send on our behalf, or in special circumstances.
However in instances where our company and a partner jointly promote our Services, we may provide the partner some personal information like the name, address and user name of the persons who subscribed who subscribed to the Services as a result of the joint promotion solely for the purpose of allowing us and the partner to asses the results of the promotion.
In this case, personal information may not be used by the partner for any other purpose. We may also generate general non-identifying profiles from personal information our Members provide during registration, (like total number, but not the names of Members). As explained below, we would use this information to sell advertisements which may appear in the Services.
With Partners Some Products and Services may be offered to Visitors and Members in conjunction with an affiliate, independent contract seller or non-affiliated partner. To provide Visitors and Members with some of these Products and Services, the partner may need to collect and maintain personal information. In such cases, you will be notified before any of your data is collected or transferred, giving you the choice of consent and allowing you to decide whether to use that particular feature or service.
Shopping If you order Products or Services from our company we will use the personal information you provide only to process the order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete the order.
Advertisements Our company may display online advertisements. In those cases we share general non-identifying profile information about our Visitors and Members collected during the registration process as well as through online surveys and promotions with these advertisers.
In some cases, we use this general non-identifying profile information to deliver specific advertisements and for joint ventures. As an example, an advertiser or joint venture company tells us the audience they want to reach and provides us an advertisement tailored to the audience. Based upon the general non-identifying profile information we have collected, we may then display or send the information to the intended people. Our company does not share personal information of Visitors and Members with these advertisers or joint venture partners.
Responses to Email Inquiries When Visitors or Members send email inquiries to our company, the return email address is used to answer the email inquiry we receive. Our company does not use the return email address we receive for any other purpose and does not share the return email address with anyone else.
Voluntary Customer Surveys We may periodically conduct both business and individual customer surveys. We encourage our customers to participate in these surveys because they provide us with important information which helps us to improve the types of products and services we offer and how we provide them to you for your benefit. Your personal information and responses will remain strictly confidential, even if the survey is conducted by a third party. Participation in customer surveys is voluntary.
We may take the information we receive from people responding to our surveys and combine it with the responses of other customers we have to prepare broader, general responses to the survey questions (such as age, gender, residence, hobbies, education, employment, industry and other demographic information). We then use this information to improve the quality of the Services and Products we provide to you and to develop new products and services. This general non-identifying profile information may be shared with third parties.
Special Cases It is our companyâ€™s policy not to use or share the personal information we collect about Visitors and Members in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you the prior opportunity to opt out and prohibit such unrelated disclosures.
However we may disclose information about Visitors or Members, or information concerning your use of the Services and Products or Websites accessible through the use of our Services or Products for any reason, if in our sole discretion we feel it is reasonable to do so (as permitted by law were applicable) such as to credit agencies, collection agencies, law enforcement, to protect the interests of our Company and Members, or as required by law.
