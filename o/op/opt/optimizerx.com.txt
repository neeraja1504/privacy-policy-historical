The following is the way we handle information learned about you from your visit to our Web site.
Collective Data
OPTIMIZERx deposits certain bits of information called cookies in a visitor’s computer. Cookies are sent back only to the Web site that deposited them when a visitor returns to that site. Cookies can tell us how and when pages in a Web site are visited and by how many people. This technology does not collect personal identifiable information; the information collected is in an aggregate, non identifiable form. With the information we can learn through this technology, we hope to improve our site.
Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
OPTIMIZERx collects personally identifiable information (PII), such as names, addresses, e-mail addresses, and the like, only when voluntarily provided by a Web site visitor and member.

If required, this information may be used to marketing partners whose offer(s) you have selected to receive in order for them to send you those offer(s) or information via electronic delivery, telemarketing and direct mail.

However, we cannot guarantee that communications between you and OPTIMIZERx will not be intercepted by others and that information stored on our servers will be free from unauthorized access. While we have taken reasonable precautions to protect this information, you should always use discretion in what information you send to us and not expect that such information will be absolutely free from intrusion.
