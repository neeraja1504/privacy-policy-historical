Use of Information
IDEXX uses your personal information solely:
to respond to your request for products, services, or information;
to fulfill our obligations to you under orders or contracts;
to arrange for and process payments owed by you in connection with orders or contracts;
or for internal purposes, including without limitation, marketing, promotions, customer support, Website administration, and feedback purposes.
If at any time you supply a mailing address, telephone or fax number, or email address to us, you may receive, if permitted under applicable law, periodic mailings, telephone calls, faxes, or emails, whichever the case may be, with information on new IDEXX products and services or upcoming events. We may also aggregate statistics that we gather about customers, sales, or Website traffic and provide this information to third parties on a non-personally identifiable (aggregated) basis.
Disclosure of Information
Information may be exchanged among IDEXX, its subsidiaries, and service providers as needed for business purposes, such as account administration, customer service, transaction processing, consumer reporting, processing and delivery of account statements, research and analysis, and delivery of products and services.
IDEXX will use contractual or other measures to require service providers to maintain a level of privacy protection comparable to our own practices.
IDEXX may also share information with joint marketing partners to present certain offers to you, but these parties will only be able to access and use your personal information for this limited purpose. In addition, if you opt for direct debit as a payment method, we will share certain personal information with your financial institution in order to arrange for payment. IDEXX does not sell email addresses, telephone or fax numbers, or other personally identifiable information to other companies. We may disclose information to fulfill certain legal and regulatory requirements if we believe that such disclosure is legally required or necessary to protect our legal rights or the rights of others, or to prevent harm, or in accordance with your instructions.
For government information requests, we comply with the laws applicable to us and other entities that process our data, and we provide details only as legally required. For content requests from law enforcement agencies outside the U.S., with the exception of emergency circumstances (defined in the Electronic Communications Privacy Act 1986, as amended), IDEXX will only provide content in response to a search warrant issued pursuant to the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty process or through other cooperative efforts with the United States Department of Justice.
Our policy is to notify people who use our Websites and services of requests for their information prior to our disclosure of it, unless we are prohibited by law from doing so or in exceptional circumstances such as emergencies. We will provide delayed notice upon expiration of a specific nondisclosure period in a court order and where we have a good faith belief that exceptional circumstances no longer exist and we are not otherwise prohibited by law from doing so. Law enforcement officials who believe that notification would jeopardize an investigation should obtain an appropriate court order or other appropriate process establishing that notice is prohibited. If our investigation into your data request indicates to us that there is an ongoing violation of our terms of use, we will take action to prevent further abuse, including actions that may notify the user that we are aware of their misconduct.
