Co-branded sites
We do not currently ‘Co-Brand’ although we do have several partnerships operating under the Options University brand including Options University Strategist (www.OptionsUniversityStrategist.com) and OU Forex Trader (www.OUForexTrader.com) that we sometimes send promotional material, but these emails come from Options University directly and no personal information is otherwise ‘shared’. You can opt-out of receiving any promotional emails sent by Options University by following the unsubscribe information included in each promotional email.
We also have a ‘Coaching’ program through a third party service, Beacon Learning Group (BLG), in which certain customer data is shared for contacting customers on our behalf, to sell personal coaching programs, but under a strict non-solicitation and non-disclosure agreement between both parties that prohibits BLG from selling, sharing, or otherwise using this personal information for anything besides Options University coaching services. BLG is a service provider for Options University and will not contact customers for their own marketing purposes.
Like most Web sites, OptionsUniversity.com also collects information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and hold information from your visit. Among other things, the cookie may store your user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information each time you visit, or may control the number of times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our site. For these purposes our cookies are tied to your personally identifiable information.
While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other third parties may use cookies or other technology such as Web beacons to attempt to identify some of your preferences or retrieve information about you. For example, some of our advertising is served by third parties and may include cookies and Web beacons that enable the advertiser to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before. We have no access or control of these types of third party tracking technologies.
Other features available on our site may offer services operated by third parties and may use cookies or other technology to gather information. OptionsUniversity.com does not control the use of this technology by third parties or the resulting information, and is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties. They may use technologies in our emails for tracking purposes.
As we adopt additional technology, we may also gather information through other means and we will disclose these new technologies as we adopt them as they relate to privacy and give you choice as to this new type of type of information collection IF it is a material change to our privacy policy. . In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with information, for example by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access certain portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name and password, and we may not be able to customize the site’s features according to your preferences.
