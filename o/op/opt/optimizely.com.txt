Additional Disclosures for EEA Data Subjects:
If you are an individual in the European Economic Area (EEA), we collect and process information about you only where we have legal bases for doing so under applicable EU laws.

We need it to provide or operate the Sites and Optimizely Services, including to provide customer support and process your orders, requests, questions and concerns;
It satisfies another legitimate interest that is not overridden by your data protection interests, including our interest in:
collecting product usage, analytics and performance data relating to our Sites and the Optimizely Services, in order to maintain, analyze, develop, update, and improve our products and services;
maintaining records of bugs, customer support requests and similar requests you file, and our response to these requests;
using information to personalize content and features on our Sites and the Optimizely Services;
detecting, investigating and preventing activities that may violate our policies or applicable laws (such as fraud detection and prevention);
maintaining corporate or business records consistent with our retention policies and applicable laws;

We are processing your information to protect our legal rights;
You give us consent to process your personal data;
We need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation, such as a lawful subpoena or law-enforcement request or to fulfill the lawful instructions of our customers (when they are acting as the controller); and/or

If an individual in the EEA has consented to our use of their personal information, and our processing is based on that consent, that individual has the right to withdraw their consent in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (“ GDPR ”), but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place. Where we are using your information because we or a third party (e.g. your employer) have a legitimate interest to do so, individuals in the EEA have the right to object to that use as specified in Article 21 of the GDPR, though, in some cases, this may mean no longer using the Sites or Optimizely Service. Optimizely further acknowledges that EEA data subjects have certain other rights under the GDPR, including the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority and to request from the controller access to, and rectification or erasure of, personal data, restriction of processing concerning the data subject, and data portability (in each case, as specified under the GDPR). Where Optimizely is acting as a controller, you can initiate a request by contacting us as specified in the “Contacting Us” section below.
