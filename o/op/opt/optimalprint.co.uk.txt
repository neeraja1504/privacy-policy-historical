We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many websites, we use cookies and we obtain certain types of information through traffic data when your Web browser accesses our Sites.

Security of Your Personal Information
We employ security safeguards to protect your Personal Information against loss or theft, as well as against unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification. You acknowledge and agree that We may, at our sole discretion, use a variety of commercially reasonable safeguards, security technologies and procedures to help protect your Personal Information against loss or theft, as well as against unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification. For example, we may store your Personal Information on computer systems with limited access, which may also be located in controlled facilities. You hereby acknowledge and agree that the nature of the safeguards will vary depending on the sensitivity of the information that has been collected, the amount, distribution, and format of the information, and the method of storage, and you hereby consent to the same. When we transmit highly confidential information over the Internet (such as a credit card number or password), we may also, or in the alternative, protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. There are always risks associated with providing Personal Information, whether in person, by phone, or via the Internet or other technologies, and you acknowledge that there are no safeguards, security technologies or procedures that are completely safe or fool-proof against hacking or tampering. Gelato Group has endeavoured to take commercially reasonable precautions to prevent and minimize such risks in respect of your Personal Information and in connection with your use of the Site, but offers no (and expressly disclaims any) guarantee, representation, warranty, or covenant of any kind with respect to the same.

Advertisers
From time to time, we may share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. We will make commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that this shared information does not contain any identifiable information and is therefore not Personal Information.
