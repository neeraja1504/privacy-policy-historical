Information You Give Us
We receive and store any information or content that you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as facilitating when you reorder print material, responding to your requests, providing our services (e.g., storage of picture, images and logos), and in other ways in communicating with you.
Automatic Information
We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Websites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses our Sites. Examples of the information we collect and analyze include the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet; computer and connection information such as browser type and version, operating system, and platform; the full Uniform Resource Locators (URL) click stream to, through, and from our Website, including date and time. We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.
Security of Your Personal Information
Optimalprint is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the personal information you provide on computer systems with limited access, which are located in controlled facilities. When we transmit highly confidential information (such as a credit card number or password) over the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
If a password is used to help protect your accounts and personal information, it is your responsibility to keep your password confidential. Do not share this information with anyone. If you are sharing a computer with anyone you should always choose to log out before leaving a site or service to protect access to your information from subsequent users.
While there are always risks associated with providing personal data, whether in person, by phone or via the internet or other technologies, and no system of technology is completely safe or "tamper"/"hacker" proof, Optimalprint has endeavoured to take reasonable precautions which are appropriate to the nature of the information to prevent and minimize such risks in connection with your use of this site.
Eligibility and Account Administration
Optimalprint's policy is to request that "Minors" (the age of Minors is determined by local law where you reside) do not make purchases or engage in other legal acts on the Site without the consent of a parent or legal guardian, unless permitted by applicable local law. You must be 18 years or older to create a user account on Optimalprint. By signing up for a user account you represent and warrant that you are 18 years or older and that you in addition have the right, authority and capacity to understand, agree and comply with these conditions and the Terms of Use.
When registering you must provide accurate, complete and true registration information. If you have been provided with a default password for registration we advise you to change it immediately for security purposes. Upon initial registration you will be asked to create a username and password, you will be responsible for keeping these confidential, and for all activities relating to your chosen username.
Image Gallery
Pictures, images or logos uploaded to your image gallery will be protected from any external access. To access them, you will need to enter your usename and password.
Personal Information Shared
We share information but only as described below. Otherwise we will not provide your personal information without your consent.
Business Transfer
As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or their assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, if Optimalprint or all or substantially all of its assets were ever to be acquired, customer information will, of course, be one of the transferred assets.
Advertisers
We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.
Agents
We engage other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include processing credit card payments, providing marketing assistance, providing customer services, sending postal mail and email to you, removing repetitive information from customer lists, and analyzing data. These persons have access to personal information needed to perform their functions. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information that you provide to Optimalprint for any secondary purposes.
Compliance
We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with law; enforce or apply our agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Optimalprint, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
