A cookie file can contain information, such as a user identification code, that the site uses to track the pages you have visited.

Browser Level Information
Optionetics web servers automatically collect information about a site user's IP address, browser type and referrer by reading this information from the user's browser (information provided by every user's browser). This information is collected in a database and used--in an aggregated, anonymous manner--in our internal analysis of traffic patterns within our websites. This information is automatically logged by most websites.
Use of Information
Our primary goal in collecting user information is to enhance your experience on our websites. We achieve this goal by, among other things, providing interactive communications such as our electronic newsletters to the e-mail address that you provide to us, and developing future editorial content based on your interests. To develop content targeted to your interests, we use aggregated user information to determine which areas of our websites users prefer based upon traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but instead how well each page or content area performs overall.
Optionetics websites are free and we derive revenues from advertising. In order to attract and retain advertisers we use the aggregated, anonymous information that we gather (as well as information from third-party market researchers) to describe our services to advertisers and partners and to assist our advertisers and sponsors to better understand our audience. This is essential to keeping our service free of charge to our users. We do not disclose personally identifying information about our users to these parties for these purposes.
Optionetics may also disclose information about our users when we believe, in good faith, that the disclosure is required by law.
When you are on an area of Optionetics websites and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information with Optionetics as well as its parent company, affiliates, business partners and vendors providing hosting and other services for Optionetics. You also give us permission to share your personal information with brokers and other companies that we think may be of interest to you. If you do not want your information to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of your information by not using that particular service. These parties, as well as advertisers who contract directly with a third-party service to serve their advertisements, may set their own cookies.
By accessing and using this website or signing up for any of our services you consent to our collecting, maintaining, using and disclosing personal information provided by you. You acknowledge that your personal information is shared with our subsidiaries, parent company, and affiliates as well as business partners and vendors providing hosting and other services for us. You give us permission to share your information with brokers and other companies that we think may be of interest to you. You also give permission for these brokers, other companies, our subsidiaries, parent, and affiliates to contact you in regard to their products and services unless you advise otherwise in writing.
In addition, any personally identifiable information provided by our users as part of an advertiser promotion online may be provided directly to advertisers.
Please be aware that Optionetics sponsors, advertisers or websites that have links on our site may collect personally identifiable information about you. The information practices of those parties and websites linked to Optionetics are not covered by this privacy statement. Optionetics users should also be aware that, when you voluntarily disclose personal information in chat areas or bulletin boards, that information may be collected by others and may result in unsolicited messages from others.
Kids under 13: Do not send any information about yourself to us--including information such as your name, address, or e-mail address. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the event that we learn we have collected any personal information from a child under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information from our database as quickly as possible.
