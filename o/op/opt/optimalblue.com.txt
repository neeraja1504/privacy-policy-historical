troubleshooting and issue resolution purposes. We may also use this data to

THIRD-PARTY USE OF COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES
Some content or applications, including advertisements, on the Websites are
served by third-parties, including advertisers, ad networks and servers, content

collect personally identifiable tracking information from consumers, these third
parties may use cookies (alone or in conjunction with web beacons or other
tracking technologies) to collect information about you when you use our
websites. The information they collect may be associated with your personal
information or they may collect information, including personal information,
about your online activities over time and across different websites and other
online services. They may use this information to provide you with interest-based
(behavioral) advertising or other targeted content.
We do not control these third parties’ tracking technologies or how they may be
used nor are we responsible for those third parties’ practices. If you have any
questions about an advertisement or other targeted content, you should
contact the responsible provider directly. We encourage you to visit the third

Technology Practices section.
EMAIL COMMUNICATION PRACTICES
Our Anti-Spam practices tolerate only permission-based email. You may choose
to opt-out or select your email preferences when you sign-up for our email lists.
You always have the opportunity to opt-out or change preferences by following

•   Email Message Formatting: We may use your email address or other
information we collect to contact you for administrative purposes such as
customer service or to send communications, including marketing or
promotional communications relating to our Services. When sending you
email we may use an image called a single-pixel GIF, that allows us to (i)
format messages that best align with your computer's capabilities, and (ii)
determine whether you have opened an HTML email. When you click on a
link within an email message, you will first pass through our server, and then
are redirected onto the Internet. We use this data on an aggregate level to
evaluate response rates to our email messages and to determine which
links are most useful to our client base. Generally, you have the ability to opt
out of receiving promotional communications as described below.
SECURITY PRACTICES
Optimal Blue has commercially reasonable industry standard physical,
administrative and technical measures in place to maintain the security,
confidentiality and integrity of the information gathered through the Websites,
and to help protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of such information.
For example, Optimal Blue generally uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) and uses
server authentication when you connect to the Optimal Blue Services. While we
take reasonable steps to protect information and data against security breaches
and unauthorized access, no data transmission over the Internet can be
guaranteed to be totally secure and therefore we cannot guarantee or warrant
the security of any information you send to us.
All data sent to Optimal Blue through its Websites is reasonably protected with
technology that enables encryption of your data using methods such as:
•   Secure Socket Layer (SSL): The Optimal Blue Web server supports the Secure
Socket Layer (SSL) transaction protocol. The purpose of this encryption
protocol is to keep confidential the information passed back and forth
between a Web server and its users.

•  128-Bit Domestic Grade Strong Encryption: Optimal Blue uses a minimum of
128-Bit Domestic Grade Strong Encryption and will increase this standard as
commercially available enhancements become widely supported on the
Internet.
