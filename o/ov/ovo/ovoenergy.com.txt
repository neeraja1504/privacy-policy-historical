Special categories of data (health and financial vulnerability data, if applicable, to include you on the Priority Services Register).
We also use aggregated data, in order to improve our operations and ensure we are providing you with the best service possible. All aggregated data is anonymised and doesn’t reveal your identity.
It’s really important that the personal data we hold about you is up to date so please let us know if your personal data changes at any time.
When will we collect it?
We (and our agents) collect certain personal information from and about you during your sign-up journey and when you get in contact with us or use our website or as part of providing our services to you.
We may also monitor and record any communications we have with you, including phone calls and emails, to make sure we are providing an excellent service to our customers.
4.2 Using your personal information
We’ll only use your personal information where we’re allowed to by law. Generally, this will be under one or more of the following circumstances:
to perform our contract we have or will have with you;
it’s necessary for us to run our business and give you the best possible service;
where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation; and/or
for marketing purposes where you have agreed to us using your personal data, see the “Marketing Information” section below for more information.
For more detail on how we use your personal information see the table at section 6 of this privacy policy.
Contacting you
We’ll contact you by the method we’ve agreed with you in our terms and conditions.
Marketing information
When you first provide your personal information to OVO, we’ll give you the chance to choose whether you’d be happy for the OVO group to contact you with marketing information. If you choose to be contacted, we may use your identity, contact, usage and profiled data to tell you about exciting new products and services from OVO and our related businesses in the wider OVO group (or they may contact you directly) including for up to 12 months after you've left OVO.
The OVO group includes OVO’s related companies such as VCharge UK Ltd, Corgi HomePlan Ltd, Corgi HomeHeat Ltd and other subsidiaries of OVO Group Limited from time to time.
If you decide you want to opt-out of receiving marketing communications after you have opted-in, or want to change how you receive them, you can always change your preferences in My OVO or My Boost or contact us at hello@ovoenergy.com or hello@boostpower.co.uk at any time. This won’t affect any marketing information we sent to you before you let us know.
We’ll occasionally remind you that you can update your preferences for receiving marketing information, or if you haven’t told us what your preferences are, we might get in touch to find out.
4.3 Disclosing your personal information
We may share your personal information with the following types of organisation to use personal information for the purposes set out in section 6 below, including:
service providers who provide engineering services, industry data collection and aggregation, call-centre, IT and system administration services;
marketing agencies to provide you with information about our products and services or other products and services which may be of interest to you (provided you’ve given your consent) and to help manage any reward or loyalty schemes;
price comparison sites which might take your details where you decide to request a quote or switch to us through that site; and
credit-reference and debt collection agencies.  For more information on how we conduct credit checks, please see section 9 of our Core Terms and Conditions here and our guide to credit checks here; and for more information about credit reference agencies and how they use personal information please see the Credit Reference Agency Information Notice here
professional advisers such as lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers who provide consultancy, banking, legal, insurance and accounting services;
regulators and other authorities based in the UK who we need to report to about what we’re doing with your personal data in certain circumstances  (including third parties instructed by those authorities to process personal data on their behalf).
Where third parties are processing data on our behalf, they won’t use your personal information for their own purposes and we only permit them to use it in accordance with our instructions and the law.
Disclosing information outside the EU
Sometimes the organisations listed above may be outside the European Economic Area (EEA), so we may pass your personal information to countries that do not have the same standards or protection for personal information as the UK. If we, our agents or our service providers do this, we’ll always make sure that these organisations adequately secure your personal information.
Switching
We may also ask your previous energy supplier for personal information about you that will allow us to take over your supply (for example, information about your meter readings, meter technical details etc.). Similarly, if you switch away from OVO, we may provide similar information to your new supplier so they can begin supplying your energy.
Priority Services Register or special needs
If we believe that you (or a member of your household) need extra care (for example, because of your age, health, disability or financial circumstances) and we have your explicit consent to do so, we may record and share this information with the following people to ensure your supply isn’t interrupted:
other energy suppliers if we believe you are considering changing supplier;
an outsourced service company that manages a wide range of energy industry data interactions on our behalf;
the electricity distributor; and
the relevant gas transporter, metering agents or network operator.
4.4Protecting your personal information
We follow strict security procedures to protect your personal information. This includes following certain guidelines (for example, checking your identity when you phone us).
We strongly recommend that you do not disclose any OVO login details to anyone. Please always remember to logout of your account when you have finished using any of OVO’s websites (such as My OVO and My Boost).
From time to time, our website may provide hypertext links to sites which are created by individuals and companies outside of OVO.  We do this if the site is relevant to the topic you’re reading about. Whilst we always try to check that the content of these sites is suitable, we cannot take any responsibility for the practices of the companies who publish the sites that we link to, or the accuracy or relevance of the content on them.
4.5 How long we'll use your personal information
We’ll only retain your personal information for as long as necessary for the reason we collected it, including for any legal requirements we have to comply with.
When deciding on how long to retain your personal information for, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and any applicable legal requirements.
Details of retention periods for different aspects of your personal information are available in our retention policy which you can request by contacting us.
In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal information (so that it can no longer be associated with you) and use this indefinitely, without further notice.
4.6 Your legal rights
You have various rights in relation to your personal information. These rights are as follows:
request access to your personal information - you can request a copy of the personal information we hold on you;
request correction of your personal information - if any personal information we hold on you is incorrect, you can request to have it corrected;

object to processing or restrict processing of your personal information - you may object to our processing of your personal data in certain circumstances;
request the transfer of your personal information - to provide you, or a third party you have chosen, with your personal information; and
withdraw consent where we’re relying on consent to process your personal information - if you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We'll advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.

You are able to exercise your rights free of charge, but if you make unfounded, repetitive or excessive requests, we may charge you to carry these out or refuse to act on such requests.
We’ll try to respond to all requests within one month. If your request is complex or if you make lots of requests, we may extend our time to respond – if this is the case, we’ll let you know.
5. OVO’s use of cookies
5.1What are cookies?
A cookie is a piece of information stored in a small file which is sent to and from web pages. They can be used to identify that you’ve visited websites before and some will be stored on your computer by your web browser.

OVO’s websites
We use short-term cookies to recognise your PC as you move around our site and to remember any information you have entered into search boxes for next time you visit us.
Measuring web traffic
We use programs such as Google Analytics and Mixpanel to help us find out:
how many people visit our websites;
which pages are most popular;
how long people spend in each area; and
what information they’re searching for.
These insights help us understand how to improve our websites.
Google Analytics uses cookies to collect non-personally identifiable information like:
browser types;
operating systems;
referring sites that sent you to us; and
the dates and times of a visit.
If you’d like to know more about Google Analytics, click here.
We also use third party analytics services like FullStory, which is similar to Google Analytics. Where Google Analytics identifies overall trends in people’s browsing habits, FullStory helps us to work out ‘why’ those trends exist and answer questions like “why is everybody suddenly visiting a certain page?”.
It allows us to:
see where people click on a webpage;
follow mouse patterns; and
track non-sensitive text that people might type into the site.
Advertising
We use tools such as ValueClick to place OVO ads on other websites you may visit. These tools may set cookies to track the performance of our advertising campaigns and allow us to tailor the advertising you might be interested in.
We also use products like Google Analytics Advertising, including remarketing with Google Analytics, Google Display Network Impression Reporting and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting features. These products help us understand what ads work best so we can more effectively promote our products and services to you.
We also use Google Adometry to track the way you interact with our ads before you come to our website. This lets us work out which ones are relevant to you and which ones aren’t.
We use Google Adwords Customer Match to help exclude our existing customers from seeing our ads, and to reach similar web users who could also be interested in joining OVO.
We use Experian to make the content and advertising shown on devices that you might use more relevant and useful. As part of this process Experian uses cookies and receives information about the kind of device you use as well as your IP address.
5.3 How can you manage cookies and where can you find further information?
