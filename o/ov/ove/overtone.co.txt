oVertone® Privacy Policy
Last updated July 16th 2019
oVertone Haircare, Inc. (“oVertone,” “we” or “us”) knows that you care about the information we collect from you and how that information is used and shared, and this Privacy Policy describes our practices. This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect when you interact with us online, via the oVertone website, www.overtone.co (our “Website”), email, chat, or other electronic messages, or otherwise interact with us as described below. It does not apply to information collected by any third party (including our affiliates and subsidiaries), including through any application or content (such as advertising) that may link to or be accessible from or on this Website. By interacting with us online, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, your choice is not to interact with us online. This policy may change from time to time (see What About Changes to this Privacy Policy). Your continued interaction with us online after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes, so please check the policy periodically for updates.
1) What Information About Customers Does oVertone Gather?
The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve your oVertone experience. Here are the types of information we gather.
Information You Give Us: We receive and store any information you enter on our Website or give us in any other way, which might include your name, email address, shipping address, billing address, phone number, product preferences, demographic information (e.g., gender, age range), and social media information (e.g., username, profile picture). In some cases, we may also collect information you provide about others, such as when you decide to purchase and ship products to someone. We will use such information to fulfill your requests and will not send marketing communications to your contacts unless they separately opt in to receive communications from us. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features.
Surveys & Contests: From time to time our Website requests information via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you may choose whether or not to participate and therefore disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (e.g., email address, shipping address) and demographic information (e.g., gender, age range).
Information We Collect Automatically: We automatically collect and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our Website, emails, or advertisements and other content served by or on behalf of oVertone on other websites. Like many websites, we and our service providers may use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to collect such information, which may include but is not limited to the type of browser/device/hardware you use, access times, pages viewed, your IP address, any referring links through which you access our Website, the contents of your Shopping Cart, and product purchase or return information. For more information about cookies and how to disable them, see How Are Cookies Used?
Information from Other Sources: We might receive information about you from other sources and add it to information we collect about you.
2) How Are Cookies Used?
Cookies are unique identifiers that we transfer to your device to enable our systems to recognize your device and to provide personalized advertisements on other websites and storage of items in your Shopping Cart between visits.
Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or disable cookies altogether through the browser’s Help feature. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the website of its manufacturer. For more information about disabling Flash cookies, see http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/security. Because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of our Website’s essential features, we recommend that you leave them turned on. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you may not be able to add items to your Shopping Cart, proceed to Checkout, or use any oVertone products and services that require you to sign in to your online account. For more information about cookies, see What About Social Media Platforms and Plugins?
3) How Does oVertone Respond to Do Not Track Signals?
Many web browsers support Do Not Track technology, which allows you to automatically transmit a Do Not Track signal or preference to websites you visit indicating that you do not wish to be tracked. We do not currently respond to Do Not Track browser settings or signals on our Website. For more information about “Do Not Track,” please visit https://www.allaboutdnt.com.
4) How Does oVertone Use the Information It Receives?
We may use information about you for various purposes, including, but not limited to, the following:

In any other way we may describe when you provide the information; and
For any other purpose with your consent.
We may also use your information to communicate with you about products, services, offers, promotions, rewards, and events that may be of interest to you. If you prefer to opt out of such communications, you can do so at any time by following the instructions provided in those communications or through the methods described under How Do I Contact oVertone?.
5) How Does oVertone Share the Information It Receives?
We share customer information as described below.
Aggregated or De-Identified Information: We may disclose aggregated information about our customers, and information that does not identify any individual, without restriction.
Affiliated Businesses: We may work closely with affiliates of oVertone that follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Policy.
Third-Party Service Providers: We also may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples might include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and email, administering sweepstakes, analyzing data, web hosting, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. We provide such third parties with access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but we do not authorize them to use it for other purposes.
Business Transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or otherwise transfer certain of our assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets, and you agree that your information may be transferred in these circumstances; however, information about you remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy (unless you consent otherwise).
Protection of oVertone and Others: We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, to enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements, to facilitate the financing, securitization, insuring, sale, assignment, bankruptcy, or disposal of all or part of our business or assets, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of oVertone, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Policy.
With Your Consent: We may also share information about you in other ways and for other purposes, with your consent.
6) How Secure Is Information About Me?
We use industry standard practices to protect your personal information, including use of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input on our Website.

It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your account and to your computer. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential.
