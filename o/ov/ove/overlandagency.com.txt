Overland Agency's Privacy Policy
Your privacy is very important to us. We do not sell or otherwise provide your personal information to third parties for any reason, except as required by law. Please read this privacy policy to learn more about the ways in which we use and protect your personal information.
In this Privacy Policy we provide detailed information on when and why we collect your personal information, how we use it, and how we keep it secure.
Collection and Use of Personal Information
In general, you can browse our website without giving us any personal information. We use web-tracking software to analyze traffic to this website in order to understand our customers and visitors needs and to continually improve our site for them. This web tracking software collects only anonymous, aggregate statistics.
However, certain activities on our site require you to provide personal information. For example you need to register to read whitepapers and sign up for events. As part of the registration process, we ask you to create an account by providing your name, title, phone number, e-mail address, and mailing address.
During the registration process, if you request to be contacted by Overland Agency when new resources are available, we will use the information to send you e-mail or mail when new whitepapers, articles, news or seminars are available. You can unsubscribe at any time.
During the registration process, if you selected to not be contacted or notified of new resources, or if you later unsubscribed we will respect your privacy.
Disclosure of Personal Information
We do not sell or otherwise provide your personal information to third parties for any reason, except as required by law.
Children and Privacy
Our website does not offer information intended to attract children. Overland Agency does not knowingly solicit personal information from children under the age of 13.
Security of Personal Information
When you submit any form on overlandagency.com, we use a secure server. The secure server software (SSL) helps protect your information as it travels over the Internet by encrypting that information before it is sent to us. We have also implemented industry-standard security mechanisms and procedures to protect data from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.

Our website contains links to information on other websites.
