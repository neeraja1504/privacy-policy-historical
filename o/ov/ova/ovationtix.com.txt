AUDIENCEVIEW AS DATA PROCESSOR
We collect and process personal information on behalf of our clients in the provision of our services. In these circumstances, AudienceView is acting as a data processor and our clients remain the data controller in respect of personal information they provide to us. To the extent that we are acting as data processor, we will process such personal information in accordance with our customer’s instructions and any agreement in place with our customers. AudienceView will only use such personal information for the purposes of providing the services for which our clients have engaged us.
Our clients are responsible for ensuring that the privacy of individuals whose personal information they are processing is respected, including communicating to these individuals in their own privacy policies with whom the individual’s personal information is being shared and by whom it is being processed.
As a data processor, AudienceView may share personal information where instructed by our clients (the data controller). With our client’s specific or general authorisation, we may also share personal information with third party service providers (sub-processors) who work for AudienceView and who are subject to security and confidentiality obligations.
Details of all sub-processors engaged by AudienceView from time to time can be viewed here: www.AudienceView.com/subprocessors
Moreover, AudienceView may provide personal information to comply with a subpoena, warrant or other court order, government institution requesting the information upon lawful authority, or as may be otherwise required by law.
Where AudienceView is acting as a data processor, we will refer any request from an individual for access to personal information which we hold about them to our clients. AudienceView will not respond directly to the request.
AudienceView will retain personal information which we process on behalf of our  clients for as long as needed to provide services to our customers and in accordance with any agreement in place with our  clients.
Personal information does not include information that is aggregated or anonymized in such a manner that it cannot be connected to any individual. We may anonymise and aggregate the personal information we process in such a way as to ensure that individuals cannot be identified from it. We may use this anonymised and aggregated information for our own purposes including for testing our systems, research, data analysis, developing new services and improving the Sites and our services. We may share this anonymized and aggregated information with third parties.

The European Commission has decided that Canada provides adequate levels of data protection.

entering into standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission, obliging recipients to protect your personal information;
under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework which enables U.S. business to self-certify as a means of complying with EU data protection laws (see below).
If you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal information out of the EEA, please contact us using the details set out above.
SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA
AudienceView uses appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect personal information both online and offline from unauthorized use, loss, alteration or destruction. We use industry standard physical and procedural security measures to protect information from the point of collection to the point of destruction. This includes but is not limited to: encryption, firewalls, access controls, policies and other procedures to protect information from unauthorized access.
Only authorized personnel and third party service providers are permitted access to personal information, and that access is limited by need. Where data processing is carried out on our behalf by a third party, we take steps to ensure that appropriate security measures are in place to prevent unauthorized disclosure of personal information.
Despite these precautions, however, AudienceView cannot guarantee the security of information transmitted over the Internet or that unauthorized persons will not obtain access to personal information. In the event of a data breach, AudienceView have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where required to do so by law.
