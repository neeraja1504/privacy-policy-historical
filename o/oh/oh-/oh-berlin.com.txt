We request personal information on our accommodation booking form, owner’ registration form, users’ sign-up form as well as during the process of a monthly rental (32 days to 11 month). A user must provide contact information (such as name, email address, passport number and address) and in some cases financial information (such as credit card number, expiry date, payroll o bank account) or personal information (copy of passport or work contract). This information is used for billing purposes and/or to fulfill the user’s requests. If we have problems processing a booking, we use the information to contact the user. Additionally, we use the information for the purposes of commercial communications related to the services provided by All-Paris-Apartments.com. Both users who book through All-Paris-Apartments.com’s website and users who register on the website give their express consent to receive such email communications.
When a client books accommodation through our website, we share personal information such as name, email address, passport number, age, gender and contact details with the owner of the apartment. We encourage you to contact the owner regarding the use of your personal information. The information we collect is used for booking purposes, to notify you of your reservation status and to ask for feedback about your stay and is not shared with any third party which is not directly involved in the booking process. All credit card processing is done by the company Adyen, specialist in online payments.
