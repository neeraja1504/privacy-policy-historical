**Sensitive or special categories of personal data  **
In the course of providing services to you, we may collect information that could reveal your racial or ethnic origin, physical or mental health, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership or alleged commission or conviction of criminal offences. Such information is considered “sensitive personal data” under UKDPA and other data protection laws and as a special category of personal data under GDPR. We only collect and process this information where you have given your explicit consent, it is necessary, or you have deliberately made it public.
For example, we may collect this information in the following circumstances:
For your safety, when you have a specific medical condition which might affect your ability to take a flight, or the accessibility of accommodation, or the availability or cost of travel insurance, you will need to inform us of that and –where required – provide us with medical evidence.
If you request special assistance to transit an airport, or on board an aircraft, this could reveal information about your health (for example if you ask for a wheelchair). If you inform us about specific dietary requirements you may have, this could potentially indicate that you have specific religious or philosophical beliefs. Also, when you provide us with your travel document details, your nationality may imply your racial or ethnic origin.
By providing any sensitive or special categories of personal data you are explicitly agreeing that we may collect and process it as necessary in order to provide the services you have requested or booked and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
If you do not consent to us processing any sensitive or special categories of personal data (and you will need to make this clear to us when asked for such data), this may mean we are unable to provide all or parts of the services you have booked or requested from us. Please be aware that in such circumstances you will not be entitled to cancel any booked service (although we may be obliged to cancel or refuse to provide any such service) or obtain a refund of any price you have paid.
How and why we use your personal data
We process and use your personal data for the following purposes, which provide the legal grounds under GDPR on the basis of which we may retain and process your personal data, namely: (a) the performance of our contract with you, whether you are a customer who has booked travel or other arrangements with us, or you have applied for a job or are already employed; or (b) we have a legal obligation to retain and process your personal data, for instance to comply with our statutory obligations to have our accounts audited and to retain certain records for a fixed period of time or to make returns to H M Revenus and Customs if you are an employee; (c) we have a legitimate interest in retaining and processing your personal data, that is we have a legitimate business or commercial interest in doing so.
To manage your travel bookings and provide our and others' services to you
When you are holidaying or flying with us or using accommodation booked from us, we use your information to perform our services in relation to your holiday, flight, or accommodation for example to issue your ATOL certificate and itinerary, check you in for your flight (if we do this online for you), ensure that a transfer or hire car is available to you on arrival at your destination and that you have access to the accommodation you have booked. We also use it to change your booking if you request such changes or they become necessary for other reasons.
To communicate with you and manage our relationship with you
Occasionally we may need to contact you by email and/or post for administrative or operational reasons, for example in order to send you confirmation of your bookings and your payments, to inform you about your travel itinerary, to notify you when online check in is available or to advise you of disruption and changes to your flight or other arrangements.
Please be aware that these communications are not made for marketing purposes and as such, you will continue to receive them even if you opt-out from receiving marketing communications.
We will also use your personal data if we contact you after you have sent us a request, filled in a web-form through our website or contacted us on social media.
Your opinion is very important to us, so we may send you an email to seek your feedback.
We will use the communications you exchange with us and the feedback you may provide in order to manage our relationship with you as our customer and to improve our services and experiences for customers generally.
To personalise and improve your customer experience
We may use your personal data in order to tailor our services to your needs and preferences and to provide you with a personalised customer experience. For example, if you inform us about your preferred departure airports we will be able to send you offers for flights and holidays relevant to your location and preference.
We may also collect information on how you use our website, which pages of our website you visit most, which flights you search for and what products you buy, in order to understand what you like. We may use this information to tailor the content and offers that you see on our website and, to send you relevant messages that we think you might like.
