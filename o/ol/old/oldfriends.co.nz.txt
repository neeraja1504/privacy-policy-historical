Nielsen//Online – New Zealand internet statistics
Old Friends, like most large New Zealand websites, uses the Nielsen//Online counting system to collect information such as the number of visitors per day or the number of pages requested per day. To do this, Old Friends has a small piece of code on each page which counts these statistics. This enables us to see where we are in the list of New Zealand websites.
For more information,  view the Nielsen//Online privacy policy.
