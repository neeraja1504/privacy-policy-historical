To support our global operations, we may store or process your Personal Data in any country where we or one of our affiliates maintains a physical presence or where we engage third-party service providers. This could result in a transfer of your Personal Data to a country outside of your country of residence, including the United States. The laws and privacy regulations of such countries may differ from the country of your residence and potentially may not be as protective. There may be circumstances in which the law enforcement agencies or government authorities in such other countries may be entitled to access your Personal Data. Any transfer of your Personal Data outside your country of residence will at all times comply with the standards set forth in this policy as well as the applicable data protection rules.
Security
We take reasonable technical, physical and administrative measures to safeguard your Personal Data against loss, misuse or unauthorized access. Unfortunately, the transmission of information over the Internet is never 100% secure and no data storage system can be guaranteed safe. Although we will do our best to protect your Personal Data, we cannot warrant the security of data transmitted to our Sites; any transmission is at your own risk. We encourage you to understand the integral role you play in keeping your own Personal Data secure and confidential. Please select passwords that are sufficiently complex and always keep our log-in details secure. If you suspect any unauthorized use or access to your account or information, please contact us immediately.
Notice to California Residents
Under California law, you have the right to request a list of third parties with whom we have shared certain categories of your Personal Data for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes. If you are a California resident and would like to request this information, please contact us at privacy@ofx.com.
Children
Our services are not intended for or directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any information from children. If we obtain actual knowledge that we have collected Personal Data from an individual under the age of 13, we will immediately delete it (unless we are legally obligated to retain such information). Please contact us if you believe that we inadvertently collected information from any individual under the age of 13.
