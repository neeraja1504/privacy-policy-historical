If by any chance we are unable to send your order due to stock shortages or other reasons, we may need to share your information (just the address and item ordered) to an overseas company. If the companies we sometimes use do not have the item in stock then we have to sell your address to someone that does. If we do this, the warranty will be with the 3rd party company. This is extremely rare, and usually only happened with wholesale orders .
