INFORMATION DO WE GATHER ABOUT YOU
The information Ozy gathers falls into two categories: 1) personal information, which includes personal information you supply when you subscribe, order, complete a survey, register for any Services, enter a contest, or provide your e-mail address and 2) non-personal information collected through technology, including tracking information collected when you utilize the Services.
Registration Information. Registration for Ozy Services may require that you supply certain personal information, including a unique e-mail address and demographic information (e.g., zip code, age, gender) to register.
Billing and Credit Card Information. To enable payment on the Ozy services, we may collect and store name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card information and other billing information. This information will only be shared with third parties who perform tasks required to complete the purchase transaction, such as fulfilling orders and processing credit card payments.
User Generated Content. We offer you opportunities to post content and engage in public activities through the Services. “Public activities” are any actions you take through the Services that are designed to be visible to other users, including comments, recommendations, ratings or any other items that you submit. Any information you disclose in your public activities, along with your screen name or ID, or any image or photo, becomes public and may be used by Ozy for online and offline promotional or commercial uses in any and all Media. If you choose to engage in public activities, you should be aware that any personal information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other Service users, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums, and Ozy has no responsibility to publish, take down, remove or edit any of your public activities or any of your submissions that are a result of your public activities.
When you share or recommend any Ozy Content to your Facebook profile or other social media profile, that action is governed by Facebook’s privacy policy or the privacy policy of the applicable social media platform.
If you have registered for an Ozy Account, we may track and aggregate your public activities on the Services. By choosing to participate in public activities, you are electing to share and display such public activities via the Services. Also, public activities may be included in RSS feeds, APIs, and made available to other websites via other formats. As a result, your public activities may appear on other websites, blogs, or feeds. Keep in mind that we are not responsible for any personal information you choose to make public via your public activities, and you agree that such sharing will be deemed to have been done by you, not Ozy.
Contests, Sweepstakes and Special Offers. Ozy may collect personal information from you in connection with optional sweepstakes, contests or special offers. If this information is also being collected by a third party other than Ozy, we may notify you at the same time. If you do not want any personal information shared, you may always decline to participate in the sweepstakes, contest or special offer.
Reader Surveys, Reader Panels and Market Research. Ozy may collect personal information from you in connection with voluntary surveys. Data may be collected through the Services, on the phone or through the mail. The information you provide in response to optional survey questions may be shared, but only in the aggregate, with advertisers and partners unless we notify you otherwise at the time of collection.
Special Events and Promotions. We often receive information regarding readers who may attend Ozy conferences, events and promotions from sign-in and registration lists. Unless we indicate otherwise at the time we collect the information, we may use such information in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
