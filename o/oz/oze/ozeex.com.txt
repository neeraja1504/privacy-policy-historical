Privacy  Policies
At RankRating.com we realize that privacy is important to all of our customers. We utilize your personal information only to provide you with up to date reviews. This statement outlines how we care for your privacy. Therefore we do not lend, sell or rent mailing lists of our customers, so you never have to worry that your name, address, phone number and credit card information would ever be used outside of our business.
RankRating.com uses Google AdSense and other third-party ad servers to serve and display advertisements on RankRating.com. These ad servers are not being provided any personally identifiable information by RankRating.com. They may use cookies, pixel trackers, content browsing, or other internet technology to improve the effectiveness and targeting of advertisements to you within RankRating.com and any other place where that third-party is serving advertisements. You may configure your web-browser to disable this. **
IP address**
We may use your Internet Protocol (IP) address to help diagnose problems with our server and track movement within our web site only to optimize your experience. We may also collect the referring URL, access times and browser type. We will not link this information to any personally identifiable information.
Cookies and Web beacons
We may use, and may allow third parties to use, cookies and Web beacons on the Site and Review Service to monitor the effectiveness of advertising or for other legitimate purposes. These companies may use information about your visits to the Site and Review Service (not including your name, address or other personal information) to provide advertisements on the Site and Review Service, other websites and other forms of media about goods and services that may be of interest to you.
Web beacons, also known as "Web bugs," are small, graphic images on Web pages or Web-based documents or in email messages that allow us or third parties to monitor who is visiting the Site or Review Service. Web beacons collect the IP address of the computer that the Web beacon is sent to, the URL of the page the Web beacon comes from and the time it was viewed. Web beacons may be linked to your personal information.
Security
RankRating.com has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. However, perfect security does not exist on the Internet. Also, in theory third parties can intercept Internet transmissions containing your personal data, and we don't control the privacy/security of transmissions to and from the site while in transit.
We also use third party advertisements on RankRating.com to support our site. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed.
Deleting cookies does not mean you are permanently opted out of any advertising program. Unless you have settings that disallow cookies, the next time you visit a site running the advertisements, a new cookie will be added
Notifications
If we change our privacy policy, we will post a notice on our site so our users are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by e-mail. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their previously submitted information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
