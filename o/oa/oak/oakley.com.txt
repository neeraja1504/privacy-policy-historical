GLOBAL PRIVACY POLICY
Oakley’s privacy and security measures are designed with the strictest security in mind, so any personal information that you provide to Oakley is used for the purpose of receiving Oakley communications and for personalizing and enhancing your web experience with Oakley. Oakley’s privacy policy is outlined below and tells you how we collect personal information, what information we collect, how we use it, to whom we will disclose it and how you can access, change and remove your information.
HOW WE COLLECT THE INFORMATION
There are many ways that Oakley obtains information from you: (1) via signup on any Oakley website(s); (2) from an online, email, retail, fax or telephone purchase; (3) from navigational information about where visitors go on our website; (4) when you enter an Oakley sweepstakes/giveaway; (5) anytime you submit a business reply, product, or warranty card; (6) when you sign up at an Oakley Store or Oakley Vault; (7) upon contacting customer service to request Oakley communications; and (8) upon signing up at an event.
THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT
When you register on-line to receive our product information, you will need to provide us with your name, address and e-mail address. When you make a purchase through Oakley’s website, you also will need to give us your telephone number and credit card number so we can process your payment and contact you in the event of any problems with delivery. When you order through Oakley’s website, we collect your name, billing address, shipping address, email address, phone number(s) and credit card number (with expiration date) or gift card number. If you contact our customer service department, you may need to provide us with additional information so that we can respond to your questions or concerns as completely and thoroughly as possible.
In order to provide users and subscribers with the most efficient and enhanced service and to better understand your preferences, we may request your gender, year of birth, sports of interest, shopping preference and product interest. Whether or not you provide this information is entirely up to you.
We also may collect additional non-personally identifiable information (for example, browser version, IP address) which will provide information regarding the general use of our website. The navigational information allows us to see which areas of our website are most visited and helps us improve the quality of your online experience by recognizing and delivering more of the most desired features and services.
HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION
All personal information that we obtain about you will be recorded, used and protected by us in accordance with current data protection legislation and this privacy policy. By providing us with your personal information, you consent to us processing this personal information in one or more of the ways described in this privacy policy.
We will primarily use your personal information to provide products and services to you, for example:
To administer a contest, promotion, survey or other site feature and to provide you with the relevant products or services (for instance to deliver a prize you may have won in a contest).
To send you information/materials via e-mail or mail about products, offers and news we think could interest you. This information may relate to products, offers and news of Oakley.
To analyze visits to the website and learn about the interests of our visitors in the aggregate, so we can improve our products and services and deliver the best user experience.
For customer service purposes, such as following up on customers who have not checked out their abandoned shopping carts or to see if there was a problem with their use of the site.
The information obtained from registration on-line is utilized to improve your web experience with Oakley by enabling you to obtain a faster checkout for purchases and/or opt-in to receive occasional e-mails, which provide you with the latest and greatest information regarding Oakley and its products.
The information obtained during an online purchase process is used only to complete the order online, to confirm the order and shipment of the order via email and customer service purposes. You may, upon placement of an order, opt to allow Oakley to save the information for a speedier checkout process the next time. Your payment information is then stored only for the purposes of faster checkout and is not used for any other purpose.
