OriginLab is committed to protecting your privacy. You can visit most pages on our site without giving us any information about yourself.

This privacy statement only applies to OriginLab.com; it does not apply to other online or offline OriginLab sites, products or services. Please read the complete OriginLab.com privacy statement.
Collection of personal information

Generally, this information is requested when you are downloading a demo of our products, signing up for an event or training, or when purchasing and/or registering OriginLab products. Personal information collected by OriginLab.com often is limited to e-mail address, language, country or location, but may include other information when needed to provide a service you requested.
For example: If you choose a service or transaction that requires payment, such as making a purchase in the Store area of the Web site, we will request personal information necessary for billing and/or shipping, such as: name, address, telephone number, and credit card number.
When you buy and install a new product, we may ask you to register your purchase electronically. We keep this registration information on file with any information you've already given us on previous visits to our Web site.
OriginLab also collects certain information about your computer hardware and software. This information may include: your IP address, browser type, operating system, domain name, access times and referring Web site addresses.

We will merge site-visitation data with anonymous demographic information for research purposes, and we may use this information in aggregate to provide more relevant content. In some limited-entry sections of OriginLab.com, with your approval, we will combine site-visitation data with your personal information in order to provide you with personalized content. If you decline permission, we will not provide you the personalized service and won't merge your personal information with site-visitation data.

We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.
