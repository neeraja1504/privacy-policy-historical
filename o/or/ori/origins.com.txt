California Do Not Track Notice __
Under California law, website and online service operators are required to disclose how they respond to web browser "“do not track”" signals or other similar mechanisms that provide consumers the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personal information about a consumer’s online activities over time and across third-party websites. We currently do not change our tracking practices in response to "“do-not-track”" signals or other similar mechanisms.
California law also requires website and online service operators to disclose whether third parties may collect personal information about their users’ online activities over time and across different sites when the users use the operator’s website or service. Third parties that have content or services on our site such as a social feature, analytics service, or an advertising network partner, may obtain information about your browsing or usage habits but this information does not include personal information.  These third parties do not change their tracking practices in response to "“do-not-track”" signals from your web browser and we do not obligate these parties to honor "“do-not-track”" signals.
