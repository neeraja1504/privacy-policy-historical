WordPress
From version 4.9.6 onward WordPress includes GDPR compliance tools. You can read about these here.
The site does not allow WordPress members, so there is no user information stored or tracked beyond that mentioned in the Cookie Policy.
WordPress writes to a comments cookie to simplify future comments by the user. This functionality is optional as of WordPress version 4.9.6.
WordPress normally tracks the IP address of comments. The IP addresses of existing comments have been removed and the "Remove IP" plugin has been installed and enabled to prevent future comments from recording the poster's IP address.
Contact Form
The contact form on this website doesn't store the messages that were sent. Any emails that are sent come directly to me, are read and deleted once they've been dealt with.
Website Comments
The comments on the main website a stored and displayed indefinitely. They act as a history of corrections suggested by readers. Comments can be left anonymously, so there is no need to leave personal information unless you want to. The IP address of the sender is not tracked or stored.
WordPress Comments
The main blog allows comments, which are locked after 30 days. Other WordPress sites served from this server do not allow comments. See the WordPress section for further clarification about WordPress security.
Server Logs
Web server access and error logs may contain information that can be used to identify a user. These are compressed once a week and logs older than 6 months removed.

Data Breach Procedures
