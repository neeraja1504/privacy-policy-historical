No matter which way you contact us you will be asked to provide contact information, a summary of the problem you are experiencing, and any other documentation, screenshots or information that would be helpful in resolving the issue.

INFORMATION WE COLLECT WHEN YOU USE THE SERVICES
Your use of the Services — We keep track of certain information about you when you visit and interact with any of our Services. We do this to provide a better service to you.

INFORMATION WE RECEIVE FROM OTHER USERS OR SERVICES
Other Ora users — Other users of our Services may provide information about you when they mention you in a project or invite you to join a project or organization. For example, if a user invites you to join a project he/she will provide us with your email so that we can send an automatic email invite. Users can also mention you in a project or task that you are a member of.
Services you or an administrator links — We receive information about you when you link a third-party service or integration to Ora. For example, if you link or signup with your Google/GitHub account we will use that to collect your name, email and profile picture. We receive different information from different integrations but the purpose remains the same, to provide you with a good service and enable features that boost your productivity. The information we receive when you link or integrate our Services with a third-party service depends on the settings, permissions and privacy policy controlled by that third-party service. You should always check the privacy settings and notices in these third-party services to understand what data may be disclosed to us or shared with our Services.
How do we use the information we collect

Based on your role in a project or organization we choose whether to delete this project or organization with your account. For your convenience, the project and organizations that will be deleted/not deleted are presented to you one step before you delete your account. For example, if you are the only admin the project will be deleted. If there are other admins the project will not be deleted. If you are the only member the project will deleted and so on...
