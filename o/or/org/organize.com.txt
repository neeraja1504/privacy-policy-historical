Privacy Policy Organize.com
As a part of the exceptional customer service Organize.com offers, we want to make certain you clearly understand how we use the information we may collect from you, in order to provide you with the best possible shopping experience.
At Organize.com we are committed to providing our customers with quality goods and services, value and most importantly respecting their privacy. The following privacy policy discloses how we collect, protect, use, and share information gathered from our visitors on our web page.
Acceptance of our Privacy Policy
Please read this privacy policy before using the site or submitting any personal information. By using the site, you are accepting the practices described in this privacy policy. These practices may be changed, but any changes will be posted before they go into effect. You are encouraged to review the privacy policy whenever you visit the site to make sure that you understand how any personal information you provide will be used. We hope that this disclosure will help increase your confidence in our site and enhance your experience on the Internet.
Our Security Statement
Organize.com takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our registration or order forms, that information is encrypted and is protected with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just "surfing." While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, all employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Our employees are regularly notified and reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, the servers on which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment. If you have questions about the security of our website, please send us an email.
Use of Your Information
Organize.com does not sell or rent personal information. However, we may share information with select partners to offer our customers opportunities to participate in a wider selection of products, offerings and services you may find useful. Please let us know if you prefer not to receive information from us or our partners by calling our Customer Service department at 1-800-600-9817 or notify us via email at customerservice@organize.com. Please note these requests may take up to 6-8 weeks to be effective.
Information From Third Parties
We may receive information about you from other sources; for example, we may obtain geographic or demographic information, or information regarding your possible interests, from third parties, or we may receive information from a marketing partner in connection with a co-branded web site or promotion. We may combine the information we receive from those other sources with information we collect through the Web Sites. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to any personal information received, unless otherwise specifically disclosed by us at the time you provide your personal information. We use a third-party service provider to send ads on our behalf across the Internet and sometimes on this site. They may collect anonymous information about your visits to our site and your interaction with our products. They may also use information about your visits to this and other Web sites to target advertisements for goods and services. No personally identifiable information is collected or used in this process.
Third Party Content + Links To Other Websites
Occasionally, we provide links that may be of interest to our customers. Organize.com is not responsible for other sites or their content. In the event you choose to explore these other sites and services, we suggest you review the individual Privacy Policies. When you are on our Web Sites you may be directed to other sites that are operated and controlled by third parties that are beyond our control. For example, if you "click" on a banner advertisement, the "click" may take you off the Web Sites onto a different web site. This includes links from advertisers, sponsors and partners that may use the Web Sites' logo as part of a co-branding agreement. These other web sites may send their own cookies to you, independently collect data or solicit personal information and may or may not have their own published privacy policies. If you visit a web site that is linked from our Web Sites, you should consult that web site's privacy policy before providing any personal information.
Organize.com uses one or more companies to place advertisements for our products and services and those of third-party sites. Cookies and other technologies such as Web beacons or tags are used to measure the effectiveness of our ads and to determine the display of content and advertising to you based on your interests both on our site, as well as on third-party sites where you may visit. To support this interest based advertising solution, we, and companies who we have contracted with, may use anonymous information about your visits to our and other Web sites. The information collected and used by this process is always anonymous, and does not enable any third-party to identify you individually.
Protecting Children's Privacy
At Organize.com, we take great care in protecting the safety and privacy of children. Our websites are for a general audience. Children under the age of 13 are not permitted to register with us. We also do not send email or other correspondence to anyone who tells us they are under the age of 13. We strongly urge parents to monitor their children’s online activity, to use parental control and supervise children’s access to the internet for their safety.
Privacy Policy Updates
In an effort to bring our customers new services, it is sometimes necessary to amend our Privacy Policy. If changes occur, we will post the new policy on our Website. Any changes in our new policy will be effective immediately and will replace any previous policy. The use of our website or any other services acknowledges your acceptance of the practices outlined in the revised Privacy Policy.

If you have questions or would like to help us improve our Privacy Policy, please contact us at 1-800-600-9817 or send us an email at customerservice@organize.com.
