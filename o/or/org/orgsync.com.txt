What Personal Information About Users Does OrgSync Gather?
The information we learn from users helps us personalize and continually improve your experience at OrgSync.com. Here are the types of information we gather.
Information You Give Us: We receive and store any information you enter on our website or give us in any other way. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of certain of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future visits for you, improving our services, and communicating with you.
Automatic Information: We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many websites, we use "session variables," and we obtain certain types of information when your web browser accesses OrgSync.com. Unlike "cookies," "session variables" reside on our server and not on your computer.
E-mail Communications: We store all e-mail correspondences between you and OrgSync.com in order to improve your future experiences.
Does OrgSync Share the Information It Receives?
Information about our users is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We share user information only as needed and only as described below.
Protection of OrgSync and Others: We release account and other personal information when we believe release is required to comply with the law or a court order; to enforce or apply our Master Subscription Agreement; or protect the rights, property, or safety of OrgSync, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
Agents: We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include sending postal mail and e-mail and processing credit card payments. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.
As part of our service: OrgSync is a form of social network. As such, the information you supply may be used to help connect you with other similar members. Additionally, administrators of any organization you join have the option of making several of the components of your OrgSync enabled organization publicly accessible. Please check with your organization's administrators before you register if you are concerned that your activities within the club may be made public.
Business Transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we might buy or sell business units. In such transactions, user information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy. Also, in the event that OrgSync, Inc., or substantially all of its assets are acquired, user information will be one of the transferred assets.
Facebook Connect: Orgsync does not send or share information with Facebook in any manner. Facebook is aware when someone logs in to OrgSync through Facebook Connect, but no user information is sent from OrgSync to Facebook.
How Secure Is Information About Me?
