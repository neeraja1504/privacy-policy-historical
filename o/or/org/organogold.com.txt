This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the terms of the OG website user agreement.

Like most e-commerce Websites, each time you visit the OG website, we automatically collect your IP address and the web page from which you came. We use your IP address only to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information about you in order to administer and optimize the OG website for you and to diagnose problems with the OG website.
Cookies
Like most websites, the OG website uses cookies to keep track of your purchases and other activities on the OG website and enhance your overall experience on the OG website. “Cookies” are small harmless files saved on your browser that assist us in saving your preferences. We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests, and to help you to save your password, to save other personal and financial information so you do not have to reenter it each time you visit the OG website. Cookies are also used to assist us in measuring our traffic flow, and to assess promotional effectiveness.

Third party advertisers on the Site may also place or read cookies on your browser. We are not responsible for cookies from any third party.
Collection of Information
You may browse the OG website without revealing any personal information about yourself; however, once you actually use any of the features available on the OG website, you will not be able to retain your anonymity. In order to fully meet your needs and to be able to provide you with an efficient and enjoyable experience, and to ensure we provide access to certain features that may be of interest to you, we may require limited personal information. This may include things such as your full name, postal address, phone number, email address, or demographic information (information that you submit, or that we collect, that is neither personal information nor financial information; this may include, but is not limited to, zip code, postal code, hometown, gender, username, age, birth date, purchase history information, browsing history information, searching history information, registration history information, and the content of communications between you and other users over the OG website). Demographic information is either “non-public information”, which consists of user history information and one-on-one communications between you and other users of the OG website, or “public information”, which consists of all other demographic information. We ask that you do not enter any other personal information or personal financial information into a publicly viewed area (for example, don’t use your address or password as your username, or include your name or address in written communications or item descriptions), as it will then become “public information.” You always have the option to not provide specific information by choosing not to use a particular service or feature.
When you specifically solicit or purchase a product or service from Organo Gold, we may request more personal or financial information. We use your personal financial information, including credit card information, to verify the accuracy of your name, address, and other information, as well as to bill you for your use of our products or services.
If you choose to post messages in our Forum, chat rooms, message areas (this may include, but is not limited to Twitter, Facebook and similar) or leave feedback for other users, we may also collect that information you provide. This information will be reviewed by us as necessary to provide customer support, diagnose technical problems, and/or to resolve disputes.
When necessary, a specific file may be retained for you regarding any direct correspondence to us, such as emails or letters, or if other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or postings on the Site.
Your buying, selling, and browsing habits on the OG website are automatically tracked for the purpose of our own research on our users’ demographics, interests, and behavior in order to better understand, protect and serve our online community. This may include the site that you just came from, the one that you will visit next, your computer browser information, and your IP address.
Information Others Collect From You
This Privacy Policy only applies to the use and disclosure of information that OG collects from you. On our website, we place links to other websites operated by other parties.

Consequently, the operators of these other websites may collect different kinds of information about you, and may use and disclose that information in different ways than we would if it were collected on the OG website. This concept also applies to your disclosure of information to any other parties. We encourage you to review their privacy policies and remind you that we will not be responsible for their actions.

Those third parties may use your personal information in accordance with their own privacy policies. You will need to contact those third parties to instruct them directly regarding your preferences for the use of your personal information by them. You should evaluate any third party’s privacy practices before using their services. Additionally, you agree that we may use and disclose all such information so submitted to such third parties in the same manner in which we are entitled to use and disclose any other information you submit to us.

These pages are known as “Co-Branded Pages” and these companies are known as “Co-Branded Companies.” If the page on which you submit information is a Co-Branded Page, or was accessed by clicking on a link on a Co-Branded Page, then we may share some of your e-mail information with the associated Co-Branded Company. Co-Branded Companies may use your personal information in accordance with their own privacy policies. You will need to contact Co-Branded Companies to instruct them directly regarding your preferences for the use of your personal information by them.

Those who contact you will need to be instructed directly by you regarding your preferences for the use of your personal information by them.
We cannot ensure that any of your and other personal information or private communications will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. We may be forced to disclose personal information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, transmissions or private communications may be unlawfully intercepted or accessed by third parties, or other users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect from the OG website.

Special Cases in which we share Personal and Financial Information
We may disclose personal information or financial information when we determine that such disclosure is necessary to comply with applicable law, to cooperate with law enforcement or to protect the interests or safety of OG, its distributors, or other visitors to the OG website.

OG will cooperate with law enforcement inquiries, as well as other third parties in the interest of enforcing laws, preventing criminal activity, protecting rights (including intellectual property rights), and protecting you and our OG community from harmful or criminal acts. Therefore, if we receive a verified request by government officials or other law enforcement agencies regarding an alleged illegal activity or investigation, you authorize us to disclose any of your personal information or history without a subpoena. In an effort to respect your privacy, however, we will not otherwise disclose your personal information to law enforcement or other government officials without a subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal procedure, unless we believe that such information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss, or to report suspected illegal activity. You also authorize us to disclose your personal and account information under confidentiality agreement, as we in our sole discretion believe necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringement, piracy, or other unlawful activity.
