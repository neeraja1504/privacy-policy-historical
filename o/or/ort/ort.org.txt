Your Privacy

1. Who are we?
In this policy references to World ORT, or to ‘ORT’ ‘we’ or ‘us’ are referring to World Ort and World ORT Trust. World Ort has a registered office in Geneva, Switzerland and administrative offices in London and New York. The World Ort Trust is a registered charity in England and Wales, (registered charity number 1042541).
2. What personal information we collect and how we use it
What we need
ORT is what’s known as the ‘controller’ of the personal information you provide to us. We will usually collect basic personal information about you like your name, postal address, telephone number, email address and your payment details if you are donating to us.
Sometimes we will collect other information about you such as your date of birth, gender and other details. We will be very clear with you that we wish to collect such information, our reason for collecting such information, and we would only do so with your consent.
Why we need it
We collect your personal information in connection with specific activities, such as campaign updates, newsletter requests, registration or event requests, donations, feedback, competition entries, information you provide in public forums on our sites and applications.
The information is either needed to fulfil your request or to enable us to provide you with a more personalised service. You don’t have to disclose any of this information to browse our site. However, if you choose to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with certain services.
Our marketing
Sometimes, with your consent, we will process your personal information to provide you with information about our work or our activities that you have requested or are expecting.
On other occasions, we may process personal information when we need to do this to fulfil a contract or where we are required to do this by law or other regulations.
ORT also processes your information when it is in our legitimate interests to do this and when these interests do not override your rights. Those legitimate interests include providing you with information on our services, campaigns, events, newsletter requests, feedback, competitions and other activities. Please see the section on ‘Legitimate Interest’ for more information.
How we obtain your details
We will also hold information about your details so that we can respect your preferences for being contacted by us.
We collect your personal information in a number of ways:
When you provide it to us directly.
When you provide permission to other organisations to share it with us (including Facebook or Twitter).
When we collect it as you use our websites or apps.
When you have given it to a third party and you have provided permission to pass your information on to us.
From publicly available sources (where possible) to keep your information up to date (e.g. the Post Office’s National Change of Address database).
We combine the information from these sources with the information you provide to us directly.
Children
If you are under 16 please ensure you obtain your parent/guardian’s consent before sending any personal information to any website or ORT.  We do have activities for those under 16 so we may ask your age. Before taking part please ensure you speak to your parent or guardian.
Please note that we will not knowingly market to or accept orders for goods or services from persons aged under 16 years.
As a parent or guardian, we encourage you to be aware of the activities in which your children are participating, both offline and online. If your children voluntarily disclose information, this may encourage unsolicited messages. We suggest that you discourage your child from providing any information without your consent.
Anything else?
Wherever possible we try to process the personal information we hold about you in the EEA, but as we are an international organisation that is not always possible. We may need to transfer your information outside the EEA in order to provide you with a service or information. Whenever we transfer information outside the EEA, we ensure that there are security protocols and relevant contract terms in place to protect and secure your personal information. This will be done in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation.
If you would like to change the way you hear from us or no longer wish to receive direct marketing communications from then use the contact form on our ‘Contact Us’ page.
3. Legitimate interests
We have a number of lawful reasons that mean we can use your personal information. One of these is something called ‘legitimate interests’. Broadly speaking Legitimate Interests means we can process your personal information if:
We have a genuine and legitimate reason.
and
We are not harming any of your rights and interests.
Please read the information we have provided in the ‘Legitimate Interest’ policy for more detailed information.
4. Sharing your information
We do not share your information with any other organisations or individuals unless we are when obliged to by law, for purposes of national security, taxation and criminal investigations and in the following instances:
If you have agreed that we may do so.
When we use other companies to provide services on our behalf, e.g. processing, mailing or delivering orders, answering your questions about services or programmes, sending mail and emails, customer analysis, assessment, when using auditors/advisors or processing credit/debit card payments.
To our affiliated charities (Regional fundraising charities such as ORT Uk).
If we merge with another organisation to form a new entity, information may be transferred to the new entity.
We may disclose aggregate statistics about our site visitors, supporters, customers and sales to describe our services and operations to prospective partners, advertisers and other reputable third parties and for other lawful purposes, but these statistics won’t include any personally identifying information.
If we run an event in partnership with other named organisations your details may need to be shared. We will be very clear what will happen to your personal information when you register.
And, we will never sell or rent your personal information to other organisations.
5. Retaining your information
We hold your information only as long as necessary for each reason that we use it. We have provided some examples of the time we will keep your information in this paragraph but you can contact us for more information.
If you decide not to support ORT any more or request that we have no further contact with you, we will keep some basic information in order to avoid sending you unwanted materials in the future and to ensure that we don’t accidentally duplicate information.
If you attend an event, make a donation or provide any financial support, we will keep the purchase information for a period of seven years for accounting purposes.
