Privacy Policy - Ordersatellitenow
General Policy:
Ordersatellitenow values the privacy of its customers. To respect the customers’ rights to privacy, ordersatellitenow allows every customer to opt out from receiving promotional calls and messages from the company or its partners. In case a customer does not opt out, ordersatellitenow can collect and use information about the customer for purposes like direct marketing and research.
This policy covers all the information collected by ordersatelliteow from the main or related websites. If you choose to opt out, you can be assured that your information will not be sold or released to a third party without your consent or a ruling by the court. Only ordersatellitenow can use the information, if necessary, for purposes mentioned above.
Security of Information:
Your consent will be taken when you log into the ordersatellitenow customer care services. You will be asked questions if you want news or alerts on your email by ordersatellitenow or its partners. Please note here that these options are pre-checked, so if you do not opt out, you get registered to receive email updates and alerts.
Access to Private Information:
If you choose to keep the pre-check on, you will receive email alerts and updates from ordersatellitenow and its partners. It could also be about upcoming events and opportunities. You can, of course, opt out of this by logging into the Customer Support Center again. Select ‘My Account’ and disable the box to opt out of email updates. You can notify ordersatellitenow in writing if you do not want your contact information to be divulged to other organizations.
Credit Card Policy:
We use encrypted, secure Web servers to protect your credit card transactions. No other party, without proper authorization, can read your credit card information or have any access to them. We are very careful about fraud prevention and our billing processes are very secure. No third party would be allowed to have access to this, if not directed by a court of law for criminal investigation.
