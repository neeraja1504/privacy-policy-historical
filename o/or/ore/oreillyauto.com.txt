What is collected
On some O'Reilly web pages, you can order products or services, make requests, and register to receive materials. The types of personal information collected at these pages are name, contact and billing information, transaction, and credit card information.

How is it used
O'Reilly uses your information to better understand your needs and provide you with better service. Specifically, we use your information to help you complete a transaction, to communicate back to you, to update you on service and benefits, and to personalize our web sites for you. Credit card numbers are used only for payment processing and are not retained for other purposes. Data collected online may also be combined with information you provide when you register your ownership of O'Reilly products.
Who we share it with
