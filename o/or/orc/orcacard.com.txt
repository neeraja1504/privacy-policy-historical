ORCA              Privacy Statement    Statement
Last revised July 9, 2018
Welcome to ORCA, which offers people the opportunity to use a single card to ride buses, trains, streetcars and
ferries throughout the Puget Sound region.
The ORCA Privacy Statement explains how information is collected and treated by the Agencies when an individual
chooses to participate in the ORCA Program. This includes summarizing the type of data residing on an ORCA Card,
as well as the type of data that is stored centrally. You’ll learn the differences between a card that has been registered
so the value can be replaced if lost, an unregistered card, and a card that has been distributed to an individual by
an employer or other institution.
ORCA Privacy at a Glance
Before getting into the full ORCA Privacy Statement that is below, this section provides brief answers to a few of the
most frequent questions about ORCA data. You should refer to the full statement below for more in-depth
information.
What information can my employer access regarding my use of an employer-provided ORCA Card?
If an ORCA Card is given to you by an employer or other institution, that "Business Account" entity retains ownership
of the card and can obtain access to data about transactions involving the card. Transaction data includes the date,
time of day, fare and bus route, ferry or train station where a card was used. The ORCA system collects this data
specific to the card serial number.
What electronic information can be "read" from an ORCA card?
An ORCA Card's microchip contains electronic information that does NOT include names but could include data in
such fields as the type of card, Business Account ID number (if issued to an employer or other institution), the
passenger type expiration date or date of birth (if present), fare products loaded onto the card including E-purse
value and passes, the history of the prior ten (10) trip transactions (time, date, route and fare when the card was
used) and the history of the prior five (5) revalue transactions (see Section 8.2). In order to keep the processing
time to several milliseconds when an ORCA Card is tapped, the information on the card is generally not encrypted.
However, date of birth or passenger type expiration date, if present, is encrypted.
The electronic information on the card can be read by ORCA reader devices. Anyone with physical possession of a
card, whether or not he or she is the rightful owner, can use the card until it is empty or blocked, as well as read
some of the electronic data at an ORCA service location. It is also possible that an ORCA Card's unencrypted data
could be electronically "read" by a non-ORCA device if the card uses the same frequency and were to come within
the range of the reader device. However, the unencrypted data which is not in plain text would require
interpretation.
1.0        Application of this Privacy Statement
1.1        ORCA stands for One Regional Card for All. The ORCA Program allows you to use a single fare card when
taking the public transportation services provided by the participating Agencies.
1.2        This Privacy Statement explains how information is collected and treated by the Agencies when an
individual participates in the ORCA Program. With the exceptions noted below, this Privacy Statement applies to the

ORCA Products, ORCA Websites and ORCA Customer Services.
1.3         ORCA Websites and any ORCA Customer Services that require Personal Identifying Information (PII) are
not intended for use by minors under age 13. We will not accept or request information from individuals we know
to be under age 13. A parent or guardian may provide information for a Cardholder under age 13.
1.4         This Privacy Statement does not apply to the following information, including PII you provide to a Retailer.

The Retailer, not the Agencies, is responsible for the collection, storage, transmittal, safekeeping and use of that
information.
1.5         This Privacy Statement does not apply to information, including PII you provide to your employer, school
or other Business Account to which the Agencies sell Business Cards and ORCA Products. If you provide PII to y our
employer, school or other Business Account in connection with obtaining a Business Card or ORCA Product, such PII
is not covered by this Statement. The Business Account, not the Agencies, is responsible for the collection, storage,
transmittal, safekeeping or use of that information.

Customer Services by mail, telephone, email or in-person, that contact may be logged and the information you
provide may be collected by the ORCA Program. The type of information required will vary with the services sought.
If you decline to submit information for some services, the Agencies may be unable to provide you those services.
You may still use cash to purchase ORCA cards or products as described in Section 3.3.
3.2       Your PII is collected in the ORCA Program when you:

b. Establish your eligibility for youth fare, the Regional Reduced Fare Permit for seniors and persons with
disabilities, King County Access paratransit program or King County and Kitsap County Low Income
fare programs.

providing the requested information, or with the use of that information, you may simply decline to receive that
level of service or participate in that particular program. For example, to avoid purchasing an ORCA Product by credit
card online, you may simply pay cash at an ORCA Customer Services location.
3.4         ORCA Websites and any ORCA customer services that require PII are not intended for minors. We will not
accept or request PII from individuals we know to be under 13 unless provided by a parent or guardian.
4.0         Information Related to ORCA Card Issuance and Optional Registration
4.1         When an ORCA Card is first issued, issuance information is created both in the ORCA central system and
in the card’s electronic memory. This issuance information includes: the card’s serial number; the type of card; for a

an ORCA Business Card, the identifying number of the Business Account.
4.2         An ORCA Card that is also a Regional Reduced Fare Permit may have a photo, name or other PII printed
on its face. That type of information might also be on ORCA Cards that are used as identification badges distributed
by employers or other Business Accounts.
4.3         When you provide PII to establish your eligibility for reduced fare programs, certain PII is retained in the
ORCA Program to enable the Agencies to administer and monitor use of these reduced fare programs.
a. When eligibility for youth fares is established, the date of birth (or for Business Cards, the date that
the cardholder is no longer eligible for a youth fare) is retained in the ORCA Program.

individual chooses to provide PII to the Agencies for purposes of registering an ORCA Card, such PII is held by the
ORCA Program and associated with the card serial number.
5.0         Information Related to the Purchase of ORCA Cards and ORCA Products
5.1         When you purchase an ORCA Card or an ORCA Product, the system collects varying amounts of
information depending on your method of payment. You will need to provide PII if your purchase is by check, credit
card or debit card (see Section 6.0 below). Regardless of how you pay, the system will collect the following
information when you purchase an ORCA Card or an ORCA Product.
a. Date and time of the purchase.
b. The serial number of the ORCA Card and the number of the device used to load an ORCA Product if
the ORCA Card is presented at a Retail Revalue Site, an Agency customer service office or a ticket

however, the following does not apply when you pay at an ORCA Retailer (see Section 10.0 below) or at a ticket
vending machine. Any PII that you provide at a ticket vending machine to make payment with a credit or debit card

6.5        If you are purchasing an ORCA Card and request that it be shipped to you, your name, address and other
shipping information will be collected and shared with the U.S. Postal Service.
6.6        If there is a problem processing an order, your PII may be used to contact you.
7.0        Information Related to the Use of ORCA Cards and Products
7.1        When an ORCA Card is presented to an ORCA reader device for fare payment or to check the card’s status,
the system collects the following information:
a. Date and time the card was presented.
b. Number from the reader device used.

www.orcacard.biz, www.getorcasmart.com, and www.nextgenerationorca.com.
9.2        Our servers automatically record and store information that a computer or browser sends whenever a
person visits an ORCA Website, even if only to browse or download information. These server logs may include the
following information:
a. Internet Protocol (IP) Address and domain name associated with your computer’s connection to the
Internet. The Internet Protocol Address is a numerical identifier assigned either to your Internet service
provider or directly to your computer.
b. Type of browser, browser language and operating system used.
c. Date and time you visited an ORCA Website.
d. Website you visited prior to coming to an ORCA Website.
e. Pages viewed by users, the amount of time users spent on a certain page, search terms and other non-
personally identifying information that may be collected as an ORCA Website is navigated.
f. One or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
We also may collect statistical information about your use of the ORCA Websites, such as “clickstream data” and
“user hits” which are visits and sessions that may be logged to determine which pages are visited most frequently.
9.3       When you visit ORCA Websites, your computer will receive one or more “cookies.” Cookies are small text
files placed on a user’s computer and accessed by the ORCA Websites to recognize repeat users, to facilitate the
user’s ongoing access to and use of the website, and to compile data to improve the site and related business
purposes. Most browsers are set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to
indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some ORCA Website features and services may not function properly
if your cookies are disabled.
9.4        Although it may identify a user’s computer, automatically collected information is not considered PII
because it does not personally identify individuals. Automatically collected information is typically consolidated on
a daily basis and kept at an aggregate level by the Agencies’ contractor(s) responsible for providing the ORCA
ORCA Privacy Statement                                     6                                                    07-09-2018
Websites. Such information may be used by the Agencies and their service providers to help understand how people
are using the ORCA Websites and improve the value of the websites and the ORCA Program. Automatically collected
information may be used to detect or attempt to prevent unauthorized intrusions on the ORCA Websites.
9.5        Personally Identifying Information (PII) will be collected on an ORCA Website only if you seek certain
services and only if you choose to provide such information via the website. The PII required for ORCA-related services
are described in other sections of this Privacy Statement. Should you seek a service that requires PII but you do not
wish to provide PII via an ORCA Website, you may choose to provide the required PII by visiting an Agency customer
service office.
9.6        When you send an email or letter with questions or comments to the ORCA Program or an Agency, or if
you provide your contact information when ordering ORCA Cards, ORCA Products or services, the Agencies may
retain these communications, and use your email address and other information included in your correspondence
in order to process your communications, respond to you and improve our services.
9.7        The ORCA Websites may have links to other websites, such as the Agencies’ individual websites. When you
link to one of these external websites, you are no longer on an ORCA Website and this Privacy Statement no longer
applies. Instead, you are subject to the privacy notice and other terms of that external website.
10.0       ORCA Program Information Available to ORCA Retailers
10.1       An ORCA Retailer is equipped with a device that can check the status of ORCA Products on a card or load
ORCA Products or a new adult ORCA Card purchased at that site. To enable accurate transfer of ORCA revenues from
the Retailer, a report of all such transactions, by card serial number, is produced by the ORCA Program and regularly
provided by an Agency to the Retailer.
10.2       A Retailer is prohibited from using any information received from the ORCA Program for any purpose
other than performing its functions under its agreement with the Agencies.
10.3       If you provide PII to a Retailer (e.g. your name and a check, debit card or credit card) in connection with
your payment for an ORCA Card or ORCA Product, such PII is not collected by the ORCA Program and is not covered
by this Privacy Statement. The Retailer, not the Agencies, is responsible for the collection, storage, transmittal,
safekeeping and use of that information.
11.0       ORCA Program Information Available to Business Accounts
11.1       A Business Account owns the Business Cards that are distributed to its employees, students or other
program participants. The Business Account has a record of the serial numbers of all cards it has purchased and
distributed. The card serial numbers may be linked by the Business Account to names and other PII that it may have.
11.2       The ORCA Program does not collect PII associated with the serial numbers of Business Cards unless you
choose to register your Business Card. For example, an Agency will typically only know that it issued ORCA Business
Card numbers 100 through 200 to a specific employer. The employer will know that it assigned card #101 to a
specific employee. The employer does not typically share the employee’s name with the Agencies but may provide
it to the Agencies for administrative purposes such as resolving questions about a card or investigating unauthorized
use of the card or other business purposes.
11.3       A Business Account may obtain transaction data for a specific card serial number.
12.0       Use and Sharing of Information
12.1       Except as otherwise restricted in law or in this Privacy Statement, the Agencies plan to use and share all
information collected through or generated by the ORCA Program for the purposes of fare media sales, fare
collection, support of Business Account transportation programs, monitoring the functionality and performance of
the ORCA Program, soliciting and receiving feedback, developing the ORCA Program, making reports on ORCA Card
use and other ORCA-related activities or products, and for any other ORCA Program or Agency purposes.
ORCA Privacy Statement                                     7                                                 07-09-2018
12.2       The Agencies will not sell PII to other entities for their marketing purposes. The Agencies will only share
PII with:
a. Agency employees, officials and contractors on a “need to know” basis for purposes of fulfilling their
duties and responsibilities.
b. Other persons or entities if it is reasonably necessary to:
i.  Satisfy an applicable law or regulation.
ii.  Respond (voluntarily or involuntarily) to a subpoena, court order or other legal process and
requests by a governmental agency; and to protect the Agencies from any kind of potential
harm (as an Agency perceives that potential in its discretion).
iii.  Enforce Agency terms of use and other provisions applicable under the ORCA Program or an
Agency transportation service, including investigation of potential violations thereof.
iv.   Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.
v.   Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of the Agencies, the users of their
services, or the public, as required or permitted by law.
12.3       Persons or entities that receive information from the Agencies may be able to combine such information
with other information they independently possess. The Agencies are not responsible for combining or any later use
that may be made of information provided to others in accordance with this Privacy Statement.
13.0       Retention of Information
13.1       Information collected through or generated by the ORCA Program may be retained in the ORCA central
system and at individual Agencies, on both active databases and in archive systems, and in electronic as well as hard
copy form.
13.2       The Agencies will store all information related to the ORCA Program for as long as they believe it useful
or required by applicable law.
14.0       Public Records
14.1       The Washington Public Records Act (Chapter 42.56 RCW) (“Act”) applies to all records related to the ORCA
Program including but not limited to: any data and reports related to the issuance, loading and use of ORCA Cards
and Business Cards; PII that you provide; and the emails, comments and other communications between you and
any of the ORCA Agencies. Generally public records are available for inspection and copying by the public but the
Act exempts some records from mandatory disclosure. For example, the Act contains the following exemptions from
mandatory disclosure:

ORCA Privacy Statement                                    8                                                   07-09-2018
Personally identifying information may be released to a parent or guardian who provided PII for a youth cardholder
under age 13, or to law enforcement agencies if the request is accompanied by a court order.
The Agencies reserve their discretion, if any, to release or withhold records in accordance with the Act.
14.2       The Agencies reserve the right to impose fees in accordance with the Act for responding to requests for
inspection and copying of records.
14.3       In the event of a conflict between this Privacy Statement and the Public Records Act or other law governing
the disclosure of records, the Public Records Act or other applicable law will control.
15.0       Information Security
15.1       The Agencies’ security measures are intended to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized
alteration, disclosure or destruction of information collected or generated under the ORCA Program. For example,
steps have been taken to safeguard the integrity of their telecommunications and computing infrastructure,
including but not limited to authentication, monitoring, auditing, and encryption. In addition, customer orders are
processed through a secure server using advanced forms of encryption software. This means that all your PII entered
online will be encrypted during transmission to maximize security protection. Because the ORCA Websites do not
encrypt email, however, you should not send emails containing information that you consider sensitive.
15.2       Notwithstanding the above, this Section 15.0 and this Privacy Statement should not be construed in any
way as providing business, legal or other advice, or warranting as fail-proof, the security of information provided by
or submitted to the ORCA Websites or otherwise submitted to the ORCA Program or Agencies through customer
participation in the ORCA Program. Due to the nature of Internet communications and evolving technologies, the
Agencies cannot provide, and disclaim, assurance that the information you provide to them will remain free from
loss, misuse, or alteration by third parties, who, despite the Agencies’ efforts, may obtain unauthorized access.
15.3       If, despite the ORCA Program’s information security measures, unencrypted “personal information” held
by the Agencies was, or is reasonably believed to have been, acquired by an unauthorized person, the Agencies shall
notify the subject of that personal information in accordance with RWC 42.56.590. For purposes of Section 15.0,
“personal information” has the same definition as it does in RCW 42.56.590(5) and (6).
16.0       Changes to or Deletion of Personal Identifying Information
16.1       The Agencies depend on the users of ORCA Cards and ORCA Products to update their own PII whenever
necessary. You may use the ORCA Website or visit an ORCA customer service office to update your personal details
and modify or terminate your ORCA Card registration or Autoload authorization.
16.2       You may request deletion of your name and other PII from the active ORCA database(s). Please understand,
however, that it may be impossible to remove this information completely, due to system backups and records of
deletions. In addition, if you request deletion of your PII, you will be unable to utilize associated features of the
ORCA Website and possibly other services offered through our ORCA Programs, such as a registering an ORCA Card.
The Agencies will fulfill a PII deletion request within a reasonable time.
17.0       NO WARRANTIES
THE AGENCIES HAVE ADOPTED PROCEDURES AND MEASURES THEY BELIEVE TO BE COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE
TO PROTECT ANY INFORMATION COLLECTED FOR THE ORCA PROGRAM INCLUDING INFORMATION COLLECTED ON
ORCA WEBSITES. HOWEVER, NO ONE IN THE AGENCIES GUARANTEES INFORMATION SECURITY OR WARRANTS THAT
THE INFORMATION (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO PII) COLLECTED IN CONNECTION WITH THE ORCA PROGRAM
WILL REMAIN FREE FROM UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS OR DISCLOSURE, LOSS, MISUSE, ALTERATION OR THEFT AND THE
AGENCIES EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY SUCH OBLIGATION.
