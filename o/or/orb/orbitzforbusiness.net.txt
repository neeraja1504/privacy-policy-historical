How we protect Personal Information
Orbitz for Business employs physical, administrative and technical safeguards designed to help protect the confidentiality and integrity of Personal Information and to reduce the risk of loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure or modification of Personal Information. When Personal Information is sent to our service providers, we require them by contract to protect all Personal Information in a manner consistent with the principles articulated in this Privacy Policy.
If you choose to contact Orbitz for Business through our Site, you should be aware that any information transmitted electronically via the World Wide Web might not be secure. Orbitz for Business assumes no liability for the loss of any information that you transmit to us via the World Wide Web.

In communicating with you, we may send e-mail as unencrypted plain text because we are aware that most Members and Guests cannot readily process encrypted e-mail.
