ObservePoint Privacy Policy
Effective May 25, 2017
Before providing any information to ObservePoint, Inc. (“ObservePoint”, “we”, “us”, or “our”), please take the time to read our Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) which describes the types of information we gather from people visiting www.ObservePoint.com (the “Website”) and from individual users interacting with the applications we provide to third parties, and how we use such information. ObservePoint complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union members countries. ObservePoint has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. If there is any conflict between the policies contained herein and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/.  As evidenced by ObservePoint’s self-certification with the EU-US Privacy Shield (https://www.privacyshield.gov/list), we understand the importance of privacy and accordingly, treat all information received in a responsible manner. By accessing the Website, you agree to be bound by this Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Policy, please do not use the Website or our services. Each time you use the Website or services, the current version of the Privacy Policy will apply. Accordingly, when you use the Website or ObservePoint services, you should check the date of this Policy (which appears at the top) and review any changes since the last version.
Types Of Information We Collect
ObservePoint may collect two types of information from users of our Website or application: “personal information” which is information that can be used to locate you, contact you, or determine your specific identity (such as name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number, etc.) and “aggregate information” which is information about your activities on the Website or in connection with the services that cannot be used to identify, locate, or contact you (such as frequency of visits to the Website, data entered when using the Website, Website pages most frequently accessed, browser type, etc).
Collecting Your Personal Information
ObservePoint is committed to subject to the EU-US Privacy Shield Principles all personal data received from the EU and the U.S. in reliance on the Privacy Shield. ObservePoint collects personal information that is voluntarily provided when a user on our Website signs up for our services. For example, when you sign up for an account, we ask you for your name, email address, and business information. This information is used to assist us in helping you select the appropriate service package and in connecting you with other users of the Website or services. When users submit information through our services, the information is co-owned by us and the user as our customer and the user information is subject to this Policy and our customer’s applicable privacy policy. We make no representation or warranty about our customers’ privacy policies, so if you are submitting information to one of our customers through our services, you should review and understand that customer’s privacy policy before providing your information to them and us.
Collecting Your Aggregate Information
Aggregate information is collected as you visit our Website, application or interact with our services even if you do not enter any information. Generally, aggregate information is used in a collective manner, and no single person can be identified by that compiled information. ObservePoint uses aggregate information to provide its services and remuneration, as well as to determine the use of our Website and to monitor, audit and analyze information pertaining to our business metrics.
Sharing, Selling and Trading of Your Personal Information with Third Parties
As a Privacy Shield organization, ObservePoint has responsibility for the processing of any of your personal information it receives under the Privacy Shield and any subsequent transfers to a third party who would be acting as an agent on our behalf. ObservePoint, on occasion, may share personal information with third party service providers as we deem necessary for the third party to fulfill their duties on our behalf, such as fulfilling orders, processing credit card payments, or other functions necessary to our business. These third-party service providers are not authorized to retain, share, store or use your personal information for any purposes other than to provide the services for which they have been hired to provide on our behalf. ObservePoint shall remain liable under the Principles if its agent processes your personal information in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless ObservePoint proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. When you submit your personal information, you agree that we may use your personal information to contact you by email, telephone, cell phone, direct mail, or text message about information you request and certain offers made available by us or third parties that we believe you might be interested in based on information you have provided to us. We do not sell, trade or otherwise share your personal information with unrelated third parties for their own marketing purposes, however, we may market certain offers to you on behalf of third parties we determine you might be interested in.
Sharing, Selling and Trading Aggregate Information Collected Online with Third Parties
We may use aggregate information to improve the Website, application and services, to monitor traffic and general usage patterns, and for other general business purposes. We may disclose aggregate information to third parties for a variety of business reasons, including to advertisers to inform them of the usage habits or characteristics of the interested audience, and to potential investors so that they may better understand our user base, etc. Aggregate information will not include any personal information and we will not disclose any personal information except as expressly stated elsewhere in this Policy.
Other Instances When We Share Your Information
In addition to the foregoing, ObservePoint may elect to share or transfer your personal information to unrelated third parties: (i) to comply with a legal requirement, judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on ObservePoint, (ii) to investigate a possible crime, such as fraud or identity theft; (iii) in connection with the sale, purchase, merger, reorganization, liquidation or dissolution of ObservePoint; (iv) when we believe it is necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of ObservePoint or other persons; or (v) as otherwise required or permitted by law. Please note ObservePoint is required to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. The Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over ObservePoint with regard to its compliance with the Privacy Shield. Please note that on some portions of the Website or application, users can choose to have their personal information displayed. If users choose to have their personal information displayed on the Website, they will be given forewarning that the action they are about to take will make their personal information publicly available on the Website.
