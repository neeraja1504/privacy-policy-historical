At registration we ask you for personal information, for the purposes of evaluating the interactive tools and to ensure the validity of responses. Certain information is mandatory - such as your name, valid email address, screen name, password. Anonymous registrations will not be accepted. Your username may be anonymous, but all registration accounts must include your name and a genuine email address. Do not represent yourself as another person.

'Have your say' rules and acceptable use of comments
By submitting a comment to 'have your say' section of our site, which includes our blog, discussion forum, webchat and wiki, you agree to abide by the following rules. These rules are designed to ensure participants feel comfortable and equal in the online discussion and keen to take part, and that the discussion meets its objectives.
Be respectful of others. Debates may be lively but taking part should be a positive experience for all participants. Comments should be civil and tasteful, and must not be malicious or designed to offend. No reference should be made to the personality of other participants nor should attacks be made on an individual's character
Stay on-topic. Your comment should be within scope of the topic under discussion. Please don't post messages that are unrelated to the forum, blog, webchat or wiki discussion you are contributing to.
Don't incite hatred on the basis of race, religion, gender, nationality, sexuality or other personal characteristic. Don't swear, use hate-speech or make obscene or vulgar comments.
Don't break the law. This includes libel, condoning illegal activity and contempt of court (comments which might affect the outcome of an approaching court case). You should remember that you are legally responsible for what you write. By submitting a comment you undertake to indemnify the Department for Communities and Local Government against any liability arising from its publication.
Don't post personal information - addresses, phone numbers, email addresses or other online contact details either relating to yourself or other individuals.
Don't engage in 'spamming'. Please don't add the same comment to more than one forum, or more than once to the same discussion.
Don't advertise. You can mention relevant products and services as long as they support your comment. No advertising or promotion is allowed except where it is for an event, publication or similar item that has direct relevance to the subject of discussion. Information about locating and sharing knowledge and expertise is welcomed, but within the specific discussion provided. All links submitted must be appropriate for a general audience, and must not link the site to material that is obscene, defamatory or inciting to hatred or violence.
Don't impersonate or falsely claim to represent a person or organisation. Please don't mislead other users by abusing our registration procedure.
Don't post in a language other than English.
Avoid being party political  - this site is about consensus-building, not party political point-scoring. This is a Government website and comments used for party political purposes cannot be published for propriety reasons.
Under 16?  - If you are aged 16 or under, please get your parent/guardian's permission before participating in this online forum. Users without this consent are not allowed to participate or provide us with personal information.
Be concise  - other users are more likely to read your contribution if it is concise, and for this reason we don't generally publish articles longer than 400-500 words.
We encourage open, lively debate but the decision to publish comments received via this site remains at the Department's discretion. Comments that violate any of the above rules will not be published. See the how to use 'have your say' page for more information about how we moderate your comments.
Posts may be returned to the participant by email, along with a reference to the broken rule(s). The participant will be invited to make appropriate changes so that the post can be reconsidered. If a participant repeatedly breaks the rules, their user account will be suspended and all their comments revoked.
Virus protection
While the Department for Communities and Local Government makes every effort to check and test material at all stages of production, it is always wise for users to run an anti virus program on all material downloaded from the Internet.
