Information We Collect
Personal Identification Information
We may collect personal identification information from Users in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, when Users visit our Website, register, submit or post information on our Website, request a service, respond to a survey, fill out a form, or participate in any of ODFL's events, promotions, activities, services, or other offers we make available on our Website. However, we collect personal identification information from Users only if they voluntarily submit such information to us.
More specifically, Users may be asked for individual name and business contact information, company name, email address, postal mailing address, phone and fax number, ODFL account number, freight information, freight recipient's contact information, ODFL username and password to access ODFL's Website and resources, social media handles, payment information, and government identification numbers as required in certain circumstances.
Users may always refuse to supply personal identification information, though it may prevent them from participating in and accessing certain Website related events, promotions, activities, services, or other offers. For example, registering would give Users access to ODFL4me's enhanced tracing, customizable reports, document review, interactive bill of lading, customized rate estimates for the User's specific pricing program, and much more.
Non-Personal Identification Information
We may collect non-personal identification information about Users whenever they interact with our Website. Non-personal identification information may include the browser name, the type of computer and technical information about Users' means of connection to our Website, such as the operating system, the Internet service provider and other similar information.
Collection and Treatment of Information
Web Browser Cookies and Internet Tags
Our Website may automate the collection of User information by using "cookies" (a text file that websites send to a visitor's computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor's browser or to store information or settings in the browser) and/or "internet tags" (these link web pages to web servers and their cookies and may be used to transmit information collected through cookies back to a web server) to obtain "clickstream data" (User-generated data created while browsing a website). The User information we collect via these automated processes include IP address, browser characteristics, User's operating system, referring URLs, and information on User's actions taken on our Website. ODFL may also link certain data elements with other information we have obtained about you to let us know, for example, whether you have opened an account with us or contacted us before. We also may use third-party website analytics tools that collect information about User traffic at our Website. Your browser may tell you how to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies and how to restrict them. We believe that cookies and internet tags provide a safe and secure way to improve the usability of the Website.
