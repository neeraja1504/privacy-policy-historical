We collect information from our customers to process orders and better serve you with pertinent information, such as order confirmations and order status updates. Information collected includes your name, shipping address, billing address, telephone numbers, e-mail address, and payment information such as your credit card number. We also require you to submit a username and password of your choice for your future access to your account information.

During registration, you will be required to provide your contact information, which includes your name, e-mail address, telephone number and street address. This information is used to provide you with important ODgirl.com services such as automated order status updates via e-mail.
Order
Most of the information collected in the registration process will be used to process orders. During the order process, you will have to provide financial information such as your credit card number, expiration date, money order, wire transfer or check information. This information is used for billing purposes and to fulfill your order. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this contact information to get in touch with you.

This process is protected by an enhanced security system. See the Security section below for more details on security measures and procedures.

Cookies
We customize certain Web page content based on your browser-type or other information provided by our cookie. If you reject the cookie, you will still be able to browse our site; however, you will be unable to use our shopping cart and purchase items. This is because cookies are required by the shopping cart to retain the necessary information to process your order. If you disable cookies, ODgirl.com will be unable to accept your order online. We do not share any personally identifiable information provided by this cookie with any third party. Cookies are used only for the purpose of providing you with a personal experience at ODgirl.com.

Sharing
We may employ third party companies to perform functions on our behalf. These functions may include order fulfillment, package delivery, marketing assistance, postal and e-mail delivery, customer service, data analysis, and credit processing. The third parties we contract for these purposes have limited access to your personal information and may not use it for other purposes.
As our business continues to evolve, we may acquire or sell business units or subsidiaries. Customer information is one of the business assets that would be transferred in these types of transactions. In such a situation, your personally identifiable information would only be used in a manner consistent with our pre-existing Privacy Notice.
