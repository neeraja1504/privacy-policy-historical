Odoo Privacy Policy
How we protect your privacy on Odoo.com and when you use our services
Odoo SA and its affiliates offer many services to help you run your business, including a platform to host your own Odoo database. As part of running those services we collect data about you and your business. This data is not only essential to run our services, but also critical for the safety of our services and all our users.
This policy explains what information is collected, why it is collected, and how we use it.
Information we collect
Most of the personal data we collect is directly provided by our users when they register and use our services. Other data is collected by recording interactions with our services.
**Account & Contact Data:  ** When you register on our website to use or download one of our products, or to subscribe to one of our services (Odoo Online, Free Trial, Odoo Apps, Odoo.sh, etc.), or fill in one of our contact forms, you voluntarily give us certain information. This typically includes your name, company name, email address, and sometimes your phone number, postal address (when an invoice or delivery is required), business sector and interest in Odoo , as well as a personal password.
We
never record or store credit card information from our customers
, and always rely on trusted third-party PCI-DSS-compliant payment processors for credit card processing, including for recurring payment processing.
Job Application Data:  ** When you apply for a job on our website or via an employment agency, we usually collect your contact information ( name, email, phone ), and any information you choose to share with us, in your introduction letter and Curriculum Vitae. If we decide to send you a job proposition, we will also ask you to provide extra personal details, as required to fulfill our legal obligations and personnel management requirements.
We will not ask you to provide information that is not necessary for the recruitment process. In particular, we will never** collect any information about your racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, trade union membership or sexual life.
Browser Data: When you visit our website and access our online services, we detect and store your browser language and geolocation, in order to customize your experience according to your country and preferred language. Our servers also passively record a summary of the information sent by your browser, for statistical, security and legal purposes: your IP address , the time and date of your visit , your browser version and platform, and the web page that referred you to our website.

: some forms on our website may be protected by Google reCAPTCHA. This technology relies on heuristics that based on technical characteristics of your browser and device, and may also use specific Google cookies. See also Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Use in the Third Party Service Providers section below.
Customer Database: When you subscribe to an Odoo Cloud service and create your own Odoo database (for example by starting a Free Trial), any information or content you submit or upload into your database is your own, and you control it fully.
Similarly, when you upload an on-premises database to the Odoo Upgrade website, you own the data in it.
This data will often include personal information, for example: your list of employees, your contacts and customers, your messages, pictures, videos, etc. We only ever collect this information
on your behalf
, and you always retain ownership and full control on this data.
Github.com Account Data: When you subscribe to the Odoo.SH platform and create your project, the platform requires authorization to access your Github.com account, which includes an OAuth token granting access to your account, and later, the contents of your project repository.
In-App Purchase (IAP) Transaction Data: When you use Odoo on the Odoo Cloud or on your own self-hosted deployments, some optional "In-App Purchase" services may be active by default. This typically includes auto-completion features to help you quickly input client and supplier info, as well as integration with third-party service providers for sending and receiving SMS, paper letters, etc.
When you use these services, with our without payment, some necessary transaction data is transmitted to Odoo Cloud services and have to be communicated to third-party services for the purpose of executing the service. You can find the detailed privacy policy for each service on the IAP Privacy Policy __page.
__The IAP services are always optional , even when enabled by default, and the IAP Privacy Policy also explains how you can opt-out of those services.
