Privacy Policy - USA4SALE Blog
At USA4SALE.NET, LLC (“USA4SALE”), we take your privacy very seriously. This policy states what happens to your personal information when you use our Web sites. This policy does not apply to the companies and websites that we advertise or endorse. Please visit their Web sites for their policy regarding how they handle personal information.
By using, browsing and/or accessing the site, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.  Your visit to the site and any dispute over privacy is subject to the Terms of Service, including limitations on damages and application of the law of the State of Florida.  Use of this site is strictly voluntary.  If you do not agree to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use for the site, you must immediately log off the site and may not use the site.
What We Collect
When you use our sites we may collect several pieces of information from you including your name, email address, phone number, your ad, your feedback, discussions and posts to our message boards, and where applicable physical or billing address, and billing information.  Additionally, our servers collect information when you view our site or post an ad or response, including browser and computing device information, referrer information, timestamp, page URL, and your IP address. Our servers collect this information so that we may analyze trends, administer the site, improve site performance, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.
You will see that the amount and type of information required by us depends on the activity you are engaging in on the site.  For free ads, we require a valid phone number and email address. Paid ads require all information necessary for billing purposes including credit card, bank, and check information.
What Happens to Information We Collect
Primarily you can expect that your ad, comments, feedback, and phone number will be published for all the World Wide Web to see. Most email addresses are hidden from public view. However, any web user may respond to your ad. Depending on how you reply, replying may disclose your email address and other contact information to those who respond to your ad. We publish not only to the Web, but also to a list of email subscribers, partner websites, and print publications. Your ad may appear in these places, as well.
We may retain all correspondence whether made by fax, email, or an online form. We may aggregate, categorize, and analyze the information received. Further, we may use the ideas, concepts, know-how or techniques contained in your correspondence to develop, manufacture, and market products or services.
On occasion we may aggregate data collected on our site to analyze overall site usage.  Aggregated data does not include personally identifiable information.  We may share this aggregate information with vendors, business partners, or other third parties.  We may also use this aggregate information for, among other things: quality control; conducting and publishing research and studies; development and testing products and services; identifying and monitoring trends; evaluating and monitoring equipment and technology used to provide products or services; marketing; and to help us plan for technical infrastructure requirements.
Although we make a good faith effort to keep all information secure, we cannot guarantee complete security or integrity of the information you transmit to or from this site, by e-mail or otherwise, and you provide such information at your own risk.  We cannot guarantee against any loss, misuse, unauthorized disclosure, alteration or destruction of data or personal information.  You acknowledge that: (1) there are security and privacy limitations in computer systems and on the Internet which are beyond our control; (2) the security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through the site cannot be guaranteed; and (3) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with by a third party while such information or data is being used, transmitted, processed, or stored. All information may be stored indefinitely.
We may use the information you provide to us for particular activities, including, without limitation, processing an order; customer service and support; collections; employment; marketing and research; providing product, promotional and other information to you; and to contact you regarding administrative notices.  We must release your credit card information to credit card authorization service providers and our credit card-acquiring (merchant) bank to process your payment for ads purchased on this site and to facilitate refunds. We may share your e-mail address with our partner websites, affiliates, suppliers, and other third parties.
Many search engines and other sites archive or otherwise make available the content published on our site. Presently, we allow it so that people might find your ad more readily.
What We Don’t Do
Although we publish a website of ads that make people’s phone numbers publicly available, we do not make or sell a simplified list of such information.
We do not knowingly collect information from a person under the age of 13. If we discover an ad was submitted by someone under 13, we will remove the ad from publication.
We do not make available for download, nor cause to download to the computers of users of our sites, programs that cause unsolicited advertising such as ad-ware, spy-ware, or browser hijacks.
What We Recommend
We recommend a few ideas for safer buying and selling.
1. Create and use an email address that is not your primary address. Many sites offer free email — Outlook, Yahoo!, Gmail, etc.
3. Place in your ad only the things that you want to be public.
2. Do not use an unlisted phone number.
4. Do not reply to messages offering more than the asking price. For more details, read Safe Online Selling.
