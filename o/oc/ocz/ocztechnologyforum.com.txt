OCZ Website Privacy Policy
Online Privacy and Security
Your privacy on the Internet is important to us. That's why we at OCZ Storage Solutions believe in an active approach to safeguarding your privacy online. You can interact and remain assured that you are protected by confidentiality, security, and your individual right to change your mind. OCZ provides this Privacy Statement to inform you of our Privacy Policy and Practices, and of the choices you can make about the way your information is collected online, and how that information is used.
Confidentiality
In certain areas of this site you may choose to share personal information with us, such as your name, address or even your credit card information. Any personal information you choose to share with us will not be disclosed to anyone outside of OCZ, our related companies, or our business partners who help with this site unless required by law. We will never exchange or sell your personal information to any other company.
Security
Information in our possession requires a unique password and username to access it. With this password you can edit, delete, or add to information you have shared while visiting our site. Additionally, the information you include in a secure SSL online ordering transaction is encrypted while in transit to us.
Use of P3P Technology
The Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) is a new privacy technology developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). P3P technology can be found within your Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 browser or later and provides you with the ability to make more informed choices about the use of your personal information online.
Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 (IE6) was the first browser to support the new privacy standard. With P3P, you can configure your browser to automatically detect if a website collects personally identifiable information, uses that information to create user profiles, or allows visitors to opt-out of the data collection. A P3P-enabled browser has preset options from which you can choose. Or you may customize your setting by answering questions such as, what kinds of data are you willing to share and what types of "cookie" files are you willing to accept. As you surf the Web, the software then determines whether your privacy preferences match a site's data collection practices.
Information Collection and Use
We will not sell or exchange names or any other information about our online customers. We will not collect, share or sell any information that is not addressed in this statement.
Types of Information We Collect
Dynamic Data. We collect anonymous information about every visit to our site. We do not create individual profiles for visitors, we collect only aggregate data. Our webserver collects click-stream data and HTTP protocol elements in access logs, used solely for the OCZ Website functionality, traffic analysis, research and development. We use IP addresses to track only aggregate information regarding site traffic. Computers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet, browse and shop. We do not collect any personal information via a user's IP address. We use this information only to determine how to make future visits more convenient and productive for our customers. We also collect browser type, access time, and the URL where a user is entering or exiting the site.
HTTP Cookies. The P3P-enabled browser places special emphasis on HTTP cookies. A "cookie" is a piece of data which resides on your computer's hard drive to allow a Web application to respond to you as an individual. By gathering and remembering information about your preferences, the Web application can tailor its operation to your needs, likes and dislikes. With a P3P-enabled browser you can make selections based on whether you wish to accept various types of cookies such as session (temporary), permanent, within a given domain or outside it (third party), and to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it, with or without a special "P3P compact policy" file. A compact P3P policy describes the attributes of a given cookie. At this time, we do not make use of HTTP cookies.
How We Use Cookies
Like many websites we use cookies to store and then retrieve small bits of information on your computer when you visit. This information is used to make the site work as you expect it to. It is not personally identifiable to you, but it can be used to give you a more personalised web experience.
Some of the information stored is put there by other companies whose software we have added to the site, and this can also impact your experience of other websites you may visit after leaving ours.
If you continue to use this site without taking action to prevent the storage of this information, you are effectively agreeing to this use.

Policy Evaluation
P3P-compliant browsers will evaluate this privacy policy's "compact policy" whenever it is used with a cookie. Compact policies are a form of a P3P policy which summarize what the privacy policy says about cookies. The actions they will take depend on what privacy level the user has selected in their browser (i.e., low, medium, medium-high or high). In addition, P3P-compliant browsers will examine whether the cookie's policy is considered satisfactory or unsatisfactory, whether the cookie is a session cookie or a persistent cookie, and whether the cookie is used in a first-party or third-party context.
The Compact Policy of OCZ Storage Solutions is considered satisfactory according to the rules defined by the Platform for Privacy Preferences and Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 and later. IE6+ will accept cookies accompanied by this policy under the High, Medium High, Medium, Low, and Accept All Cookies settings.
