If necessary, Ocean Spray may also ask you to provide it with additional personal information from time to time, including when you contact our Consumer Services Team.
You are never required to provide Ocean Spray with your personal information, but failure to provide information may result in Ocean Spray's inability to provide you with the information, goods, or services you have requested. If you wish to communicate with us anonymously or by using a pseudonym, you may do so. However, if may be impracticable in some circumstances, for example if you wish to participate in a promotion.
Ocean Spray collects, uses, and discloses your personal information for a range of purposes, such as those listed above. When you supply Personal Information on this site, we will use it for the purpose for which it was collected (e.g. to enter you in a sweepstakes or loyalty program, or to fulfill the delivery of a sweepstakes prize or product order or to send you information regarding our products and promotions). If you specifically agree to follow-up contacts by us or ask to be put on our mailing list when you register, we may contact you from time to time. You can always change your preference for follow-up contacts or opt out of any further contacts or services just by e-mailing us at any time or by visiting the area of the site where you registered. However, unless you specifically register to receive communication from a site, that site will not contact you.
The Website may also collect Personal Information from you about a third party (e.g., the site might allow you to send an e-mail or message to a friend, in which case we will need that person's name and e-mail address.) Please note that we use such information only for the specified purpose (e.g. to deliver the e-mail message) and we will not contact the third party again by e-mail unless you request us to, if they have an existing business relationship with us, or the third party contacts us.

Children’s Privacy Policy for Promotions, Sweepstakes, and Competitions
From time to time, however, we may request limited personally-identifiable information in order to conduct online contests or sweepstakes. Consistent with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA"), Ocean Spray will never knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without first obtaining verifiable consent from the child's parent or legal guardian. Our practices with respect to collection of personally-identifiable information from children under the age of 13 are described below. We do not condition a child's participation in an activity on the child's disclosing more personal information than is reasonably necessary to engage in the activity. In addition, a parent may at any time review and edit any personally-identifiable information collected about their child under the age of 13, have this information deleted, and prohibit further collection or use of the child's information (although this may require the child to forfeit any prize won in a sweepstakes or contest).
From time to time, we reserve the right to make updates to this Privacy Policy. We will notify you about material changes in the way we treat personally identifiable information by, for example, placing a notice on this Website. We encourage you to periodically check back and review this Privacy Policy so that you always will know what information we collect, how we use it, and to whom we disclose it. Your continued use of the Website following any changes to this Privacy Policy will be deemed to constitute your acceptance of such change.
Please note: The laws and regulations in different countries impose different (and even conflicting) requirements on the Internet and data protection. All matters relating to this Website are governed by the laws of the State of Delaware in the USA. If you are located outside the USA, including in the European Economic Area, and you contact us, please not that any information you provide will be transferred to the USA and by submitting the information you authorize this transfer and understand that the information you provide will be protected as provided under U.S. law, not the law of your home country.
