OTHER ISSUES
What is the legal basis of processing?
Some jurisdictions require an explanation of the legal basis for collecting and processing Personal
Data. We have several different legal grounds on which we collect and process Personal Data,
including:
as necessary to perform a transaction (such as when we respond to your requests);
as necessary to comply with a legal obligation (such as when we use Personal Data for recordkeeping to
substantiate tax liability);
consent (where you have provided consent as appropriate under applicable law, such as for direct
marketing or certain cookies); and
necessary for legitimate interests (such as when we act to maintain our business generally, including
maintaining the safety and security of the Site).
With respect to legitimate interests, given that we are a B2B company, we typically collect and process
limited Personal Data about customer contacts and other individuals acting in their business capacities,
as part of our overall effort to reduce the privacy impact on individuals.
What are the consequences of not providing Personal Data?
You are not required to provide all Personal Data identified in this Privacy Policy to use our Site or to
interact with us offline, but certain functionality will not be available if you do not provide certain
Personal Data. If you do not provide certain Personal Data, we may not be able to respond to your
requests, perform a transaction with you, or provide you with marketing that we believe you would find
valuable.
Do we engage in automated decision-making without human intervention?
Except with regard to certain recruitment activities, which are detailed in a separate privacy statement,
we do not use automated decision-making without human intervention, including profiling, in a way that
produces legal effects concerning you or otherwise significantly affects you.
Does the Site honor do not track ("DNT") signals sent via browsers?
Yes, we DO honor DNT signals.
How long do we retain Personal Data?
We typically retain Personal Data related to marketing activities for as long as you accept marketing
communications from us and then generally for up to 2 years. After 2 years, or upon request, we will
generally securely delete such data in accordance with applicable law. For Personal Data that we
collect and process for other purposes, as described above, we typically retain such Personal Data for
no longer than the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, and as
otherwise needed to address tax, corporate, compliance, employment, litigation, and other legal rights
and obligations.

Company page Since our founding in the early 1960s, Oceaneering has expanded and grown globally to service several industries such as the offshore energy industry, defense, entertainment, material handling, aerospace, science, and renewable energy industries. In 1964, Mike Hughes and Johnny Johnson formed a Gulf of Mexico diving company called World Wide Divers. The company grew in response to increasing demand for their services and in 1969 merged with two other diving companies to form Oceaneering International, Inc. To solve the toughest challenges, we do things differently, creatively, and smarter. As your trusted partner, our unmatched experience and truly innovative portfolio of technologies and solutions give us the flexibility to adapt and evolve, regardless of market conditions. Our mission is to solve the unsolvable. We thrive by creating industry-changing technically creative solutions for the most complex operational challenges under water, on land, and in space. Our five core values establish a common culture and demonstrate what is most important for us as a company. Since the beginning, the company has transformed from a small regional diving company into a global provider of engineered products and services. Today, we develop products and services for use throughout the lifecycle of an offshore oilfield, from drilling to decommissioning. We operate the world's premier fleet of work class ROVs. Additionally, we are a leader in offshore oilfield maintenance services, umbilicals, subsea hardware, and tooling. We also serve the aerospace, defense, and theme park industries. Underpinning everything we do, safety is not only the foundation of our core values, but it is vital to our unmatched performance record and company culture. The industries we serve are as diverse as they are complex. Whether we are engineering deepwater umbilicals or developing robotics for aerospace applications, the safety and health of our employees, vendors, and customers is an integral part of our day-to-day business. If we are working, then our responsibility is to be working safely. Since our inception in 1964, we have placed a high value on employee safety—from diving services and subsea inspection to vessel-based installation operations. We have and will continue to evolve not only our health, safety, and environmental (HSE) processes, but those of the industries in which we work. Although we have been fatality-free since 1999, our HSE journey goes beyond statistics. As our portfolio of services has grown, we have continued to prioritize and advance our approach to HSE.
