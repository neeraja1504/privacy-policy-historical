WHAT THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVERS
This policy covers how OCSC treats personal information that it receives, including information related to your past use of certain Court services. Personal information is information about you that is uniquely identifiable such as your name, residential address, email address, or phone number.
INFORMATION COLLECTED AND USE GENERAL
OCSC retains personal information when you use certain OCSC online applications. For example, when you use certain Court online services we may ask for information such as your name, email address, birth date, gender, zip code, and occupation. When you input this information the Court may retain it in order to assist you in future transaction and to customize the content you see, fulfill your requests for services, improve our services, or to contact you in order to alert to you an impending court appearance or some other issue that we feel may be important to your Court-related matter.
CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY
We strictly limit access to personal information about you to those employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide assistance to you. We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to protect personal information about you.
We do create individual profiles with the information you provide. We do not give it to any other public or private organization for commercial purposes or otherwise. There is one exception to this policy: if you communicate a threat or a message that describes or promotes unlawful activity, the Court will share it with law enforcement.
The Court may use a 3rd party to collect website usage statistics. We do not share this information with outside agencies.
