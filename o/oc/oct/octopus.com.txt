Introduction
Welcome to Octopus Deploy! We offer a deployment automation tool that you can download, and install on your own servers, and that we may also provide in a hosted/Software-as-a-Service capacity.

Websites

Information we collect and receive
1. Information that you give to us directly

Contact information, such as your name, email, mailing address and phone number
Billing information, such as credit card details and billing addresses
Profile information, such as a username, profile photo and job title
Preferences, such as notification and email marketing preferences
This information is provided by you when you enter it into our website or use one of our products, and so you naturally consent to us collecting it.
In some cases information about you may be entered by someone else, typically a billing or system administrator at your company - for example when they set up an account for you, or include you as a contact on an invoice. If you are providing information about someone else, you must have the authority to act for them and to consent to the collection and use of their personal information as described in this policy.

2. Information that we collect indirectly
We also gather information about you indirectly, through observing how you use our Websites or SaaS Products. This includes:
