Your personal information is used to create your personal access to our online product, and to contact you in the course of using this product. Financial information that is collected is used to verify, identity and to bill either you or your company for products and services, as applicable. Demographic and profile data collected by Octazen may be used to tailor this web site or any requested email communications, and to display information that is more relevant to you. Octazen also compiles demographic and product use information, but in the aggregate only, and may make that aggregate information publicly available. Under no circumstances will Octazen make any personal information about an individual user available to anyone.
Your email address is used to only send you information that you have requested. As part of your use of our web services, Octazen allows you to elect to receive, or not receive, certain information from Octazen.
Octazen adheres strictly to permission-based email policy. Except as mentioned above, Octazen will not send you unsolicited email information, commercial offers or advertisements.

Unsubscribe requests are fulfilled within minutes and no further communications will be sent to users who have stated that they do not wish to receive the specified information.

Security Technology
Octazen has made a substantial investment in the latest server, database, backup and firewall technologies to protect our information assets. These technologies are deployed as part of sophisticated security architecture. All data resides in a tightly controlled, secure data center.
