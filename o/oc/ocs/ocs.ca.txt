﻿Protecting your privacy at the Ontario Cannabis Store
The Ontario Cannabis Retail Corporation, doing business as the Ontario Cannabis Store “OCS” is committed to protecting the privacy of its customers, in accordance with Ontario’s Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA).
We understand that our customers expect us to keep their purchases confidential, and so we have made a deliberate choice to protect personal information.
We only collect information that is necessary for each transaction. We won’t use or share it for any other purposes, and it will never be sold to third parties. All information will be kept for only the minimum length of time required by law and then deleted as soon as possible. Visitors to the site will not be required to create an online account or profile in order to purchase products.
When we ship orders, we deliver in discreet, plain packaging, so the nature of your purchase is not revealed.
