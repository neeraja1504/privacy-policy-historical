Ironclad Secure Shopping:
As a Google, PayPal, and LinkPoint Certified Merchant, we have agreed to abide by the principles outlined in their Privacy Policies. All orders placed on our store site are encrypted using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology - rated one of the most prevalent and secure systems available for online store customers. SSL is an extremely complex form of cryptography that makes it virtually impossible for a third party to decrypt any personal information you provide. You can shop in confidence and be assured that your personal and credit card information is protected when transmitted online. To learn more about SSL technology and how it works you can go online and use any of the major search engines. A great place to start is by visiting Webopedia's discussion on SSL.
