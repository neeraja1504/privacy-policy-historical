Changes to Data Protection Legislation. Data Protection legislation and the Act is currently going through a period of change. The introduction of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the new British Data Protection Bill, which will replace the Act and is currently passing through Parliament is the basis of this change. This Privacy Notice is therefore intended to comply with the Act and GDPR but may change over time.

Data Protection Officer (DPO). **** OGV’s DPO is Kenneth Dooley. The OGV DPO fulfils a number of roles, one of which is to be the primary and independent point of contact for Data Subjects. The mechanism for Data Subjects to raise concerns regarding the processing of their personal data by OGV is to email: office@ogvenergy.co.uk, or telephone 01224 083 114; or send a letter by registered mail to OGV House, 11 Thistle Place, Aberdeen, AB10 1UZ at which point the inquiry will be forwarded to the DPO for action.
Purpose of Processing Personal Data. We collect personal data for two reasons. Firstly, to process your order and secondly, to provide you with the best possible service, including providing promotions on behalf of our third party partners.
Lawful Basis of Processing Personal Data. The lawful basis of processing your personal data are as follows:
Legitimate Interest. As part of general marketing activities, OGV’s Legitimate Interest is to collect your personal data when you visit this website.
Consent. Once you have agreed to this Privacy Notice & the Cookie Policy of our Terms & Conditions, we will process your personal data on the basis of Consent.
Contract. Once you have started the process of booking a course or event, we will process your personal data on the basis of a Contract, even if the process hasn’t been completed.
Categories of Personal Data Processed. The information we hold should be accurate and up to date. The personal information which we hold will be held securely in accordance with our internal security policy and the law. The type or categories of personal data we will collect about you includes your:
Name;
Postal address;
Email address; and
Credit / debit card details. You card details are not stored on our website, or elsewhere. They are used only when entered at the time of ordering to process the transaction, however they are stored securely by PayPal.
Category of Recipients of Personal Data. Your name, email and postal address will be passed to venue hosts as part of any events or training courses that you have booked to attend for the purpose of administration, safety and security. This may include supplementary information regarding any dietary requirements that you may have.
Transfer of Personal Data Outside the EEA (European Economic Area ). Personal data will only be transferred outside the EEA or other areas of adequacy determined by the EU, to support the administration of events or training taking place in those countries. If this is required, consent will be explicitly requested from you.
Sensitive Personal Data. We will never collect sensitive personal data about you without your explicit consent and a clear explanation why it is required.
Sale or Passing of Personal Data to Third Parties. We will not sell or pass your personal data to any company.
Retention of Personal Data. We will retain your personal data to support our records for 3 years to support our obligations to HMRC, and for reference of attendance and quality assurance of courses. Once this period is reached we will securely dispose of your personal data.
Data Subject’s Rights. Under the Act and in even more so under the GDPR you have a number of Rights which we have outlined below:
Right of Access. You are entitled to access your personal data so that you are aware of and can verify the lawfulness of the processing. This is achieved through the mechanism of Subject Access Rights (SAR) and you have the right to obtain:
Confirmation that your data is being processed;
Access to your personal data (a copy); and
Other supplementary information, which corresponds to the information in this privacy notice.
Fees and  ** Timings **   OGV may choose to: charge a reasonable fee taking into account the administrative costs of providing the information; or refuse to respond. The reasons for this will be formally notified to you and your rights to appeal to the appropriate supervisory authority will be highlighted.
Identify Verification. To protect your personal data, OGV will seek to verify your identity before releasing any information, which will normally be in electronic format.
Right of Rectification. You are entitled to have personal data rectified if it is inaccurate or incomplete. OGV will respond within one month of your request. In the unlikely event OGV does not take action to the request for rectification, OGV will inform you of your rights to complain or seek judicial remedy.
Right of Erasure. You may request the deletion or removal of personal data where there is no compelling reason for its continued processing. The Right to Erasure does not provide an absolute ‘right to be forgotten,’ especially once the processing is based upon a contract. However, you do have a right to have personal data erased and to prevent processing in specific circumstances:
Where the personal data is no longer necessary in relation to the purpose for which it was originally collected/processed;
When you withdraw consent (and this is the basis of processing);
When you object to the processing and there is no overriding legitimate interest for continuing the processing;
The personal data was unlawfully processed;
The personal data has to be erased in order to comply with a legal obligation; and
The personal data is processed in relation to the offer of information society services to a child, which OGV does not provide.
Right to Restrict Processing. Under the Act, you have a right to ‘block’ or suppress processing of personal data. The restriction of processing under the GDPR is similar. When processing is restricted, OGV is permitted to store the personal data, but not further process it. In this event exactly what is held and why will be explained to you.
Right to Data Portability. You may request to obtain and reuse your personal data for your own purposes across different services. This allows you to move, copy or transfer personal data easily from one IT environment to another in a safe and secure way, without hindrance to usability. The Right to Data Portability only applies:
To personal data you have provided to OGV;
Where the processing is based on your consent or for the performance of a contract; and
When processing is carried out by automated means.
In these circumstances OGV will provide a copy of your data in CSV format, free of charge, without undue delay and within one month. If there is a delay to this, you will be informed.
Right to Object. You have the right to object to:
Processing based on legitimate interests or the performance of a task in the public interest/exercise of official authority (including profiling);
Direct marketing (including profiling); and
Processing for purposes of scientific/historical research and statistics.
OGV do not participate in the first and third activities, however do conduct marketing activities as explained above.
Automated Decision Making and Profiling. OGV does not employ any automated decision-making or conduct profiling of Data Subjects. However, if you have consented to be held on our Customer Relationship Management (CRM) data base we may periodically send you marketing information so that you are informed of upcoming events, training and updates to information within the membership forum. These will be automated but they do not involve automated decision-making or profiling.
