Personal information collected
The purpose of the Oil and Gas People website is to permit Users to voluntarily provide information about themselves for the purposes of job seeking. You willingly provide us certain personal information, which we collect in order to allow you to benefit from the Oil and Gas People website. If you have any hesitation about providing such information to us and/or having such information displayed on the Oil and Gas People website or otherwise used in any manner permitted in this Privacy Policy, you should not become a member of Oil and Gas People.
We collect your personal information in the following ways:
Registration
In order to become a User, you must first create an account on our website. To create an account you are required to provide the following contact information, which you recognize and expressly acknowledge is personal information allowing others, including Oil and Gas People, to identify your: name, email address, country, ZIP/postal code, a brief summary of your professional background, and a password chosen by you.
Profile Information
Once you become a User, you may provide additional information in the Profile section describing your skills, professional experiences, employment history, employment documents and other information related to your career. Any information you provide at registration or in the Profile section that is not personally identifiable may be used in the same manner and extent to which other information that is not personally identifiable is permitted to be used hereunder, including for the purpose of serving advertisements through the service.
All candidates edited profiles will be fully visible and searchable to anyone using the site. These edited profiles will contain general information relating to work history, qualifications, location, experience, availability and training certificates. These profiles will not contain candidate’s names, contact details, date of birth or their current employment position.
Candidates can link to their edited profiles using a standard URL. Edited profiles will be indexed by search engines. Oil and Gas People cannot control the content of third party websites. Changes you make to your profile whether editing it or deleting it may take some time to reflect in 3rd party sites.
Candidates have the option once registered to link to a full version of their profile. This special URL should only be sent to trusted sources and is intended to be used to allow selected recruiters access to your full profile for free. We do not recommend this URL be used in the public domain to link to your profile from websites, social networks, blogs etc. Any person or company you choose to send this link to will have full access to your profile, all contact details and any certificates or documents you have chosen to upload to Oil and Gas People. The difference between the 2 link types is further explained from within the relevant pages of Oil and Gas People.
How we share your information with recruiters.
We give our users full control over their personal details. When you build a profile on Oil and Gas People you have some choices that allow you to decide how much of your information will be available to recruiters using our site.
From your control panel you have the option to turn profile privacy on or off. Profiles with privacy turned off allow recruiters to access all the information contained within your profile. This includes personal information, contact details, any documents uploaded to the site and all of your employment history and work preferences.
Recruiters with full access to our site will be able to access this information on any candidate while recruiters with limited or Pay per Match access will be required to pay a fee before your contact details are released.
With profile privacy switched on, your edited profile will be all that recruiters can see until you confirm you want to give them access to your contact details. This confirmation will be provided in the form of an automatic email recruiters can send you with details on a specific position they are recruiting for. Such requests will be sent to your email through the Oil and Gas People system without your email address being released to the recruiter. Only once you click on the ‘confirm an interest’ link within the email will recruiters be able to see your contact details. If you state you are not interested your details will remain hidden. Recruiters are able to view the status of each request made from within their control panel.
By applying directly for a position listed on Oil and Gas People you are confirming that the recruiter may see your contact details and have access to your full profile.
All recruiters signing up to the site are verified in accordance with our own procedures, we verify each company manually to ensure as far as is reasonably practicable that all recruiters using our site are genuine and that their intentions are in accordance with the services we provide. We also monitor the use of such accounts for suspicious or irregular activity and will take any action required to protect candidates from fraudulent attempts to access their data.
Customer Service
Oil and Gas People may collect information on your site usage to improve our services and to provide a high level of customer service. We offer a live support feature through our contact page that allows recruiters or candidates to contact our support team in real time. This service is not available 24hours; instead candidates can contact us using the feedback links or contact forum on the contact page. As an internet based company we do not offer telephone support through our site but we are happy to get in contact with site users by this means if necessary.

We will only share your personally identifiable information with third parties to carry out your instructions or to provide specific services or information. For instance, we may use a credit card processing company to bill Users for additional services. These third parties do not retain, share, or store any personally identifiable information except to provide these services and they are bound by confidentiality agreements which limit their use of such information. Candidates are not charged for registering or using Oil and Gas People but we do offer 3rd party services from our toolkit, some of which may incur a charge. These are additional services and users will be given clear choices as to whether they use them or not.
Oil and Gas People offers a “public profile” feature which allows Users to publish their full Oil and Gas People profile on the internet by means of a link. Users may choose not to use this feature. However any links posted would continue to give access until deleted or removed. Oil and Gas People does not warrant how often third-party search engines will update their cache.
