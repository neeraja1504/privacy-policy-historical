2. Changes in this Privacy Policy

3. Account Creation for Children
We share Parents’ concern about the safety of children online.  We comply with the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“ COPPA ”) and the new regulations implementing it, as revised effective July 1, 2013 (“ COPPA Rule ”), * to the extent they apply to us and to our Services.  We do not knowingly collect Children’s Personal Information (defined below) from children under the age of 13 (each a “ *Child ” and collectively “ Children ”), "Children's Personal Information" means personal information as defined in Section 312.2 of the COPPA Rule. In order to set up a Sub Account for a child, we collect information about the child from a parent, guardian or authorized adult (collectively, " Parent "). This information includes the Child's first and last name, a username and password, date of birth, and gender. Parents can learn how to change or delete their information or their Child's information in Section 11 on "Changing and Deleting Information". If it is discovered that we have collected information from a Child, we will delete the Child's information.
Only a Parent may fully activate a Sub Account (defined in Section 4 below) and fully activate a Virtual Piggy profile for a Child.  This way we are collecting such information from the Parent, not the Child, we can enable Parent controls and we can facilitate e-commerce transactions requested by the Child between the Parent and the merchant rather than between the Child and the merchant. Even after a Parent has set up a Child’s profile and account, a Child’s use of our Service and participation and access to the Sites is not conditional upon his/her providing any Children’s Personal Information that requires verified parental consent under COPPA.  Everything else necessary to facilitate merchant transactions comes from the Parent and the Parent can control what transactions can be facilitated by our Service.  Youth, 13 years of age and older, may submit Personal Information themselves and may be able to activate a fully functional Oink account without parental consent.
We also provide Youth and Children with tools to privately send an outbound-only message via the Service to their Parents, if their Parents have created a Primary Account (defined below) (e.g., transaction request message and wishlist submission).  We do not share Children’s Personal Information with any third party, other than our service providers and agents necessary to provide the Service, except to the extent permitted or compelled by applicable law (e.g., to law enforcement or in connection with public safety) or as otherwise set forth in the other Sections of this Policy.
We collect the following Non-Personal Information from Youth and Children when they use the Wishlist functionality via our Service: the URL for the merchant site and the particular products, services, games or other items they wish to purchase from the merchant using the Service, including a description and price of the item.  We may also allow Youth and Children to include a personalized message with a variety of requests to the Parent (such as, store permissions, funding options, shopping preferences, goals and Wishlist) where such requests and message are for the Parent’s benefit and not publicly available.
Inquiries and requests regarding the collection, use, processing, sharing and transfer of Children’s Personal Information in connection with our Services, including to notify us that your Child may have submitted Personal Information to us without your consent, may be directed to us as set forth in Section 15 below.

4. Types of Information Collected
a. An Overview of the Information We Collect and How
Only individuals thirteen (13) years of age and above (“Individuals”) should create a functional Primary Oink Account (“ Primary Account ”), and only Parents may create profiles for Youth and Children (“ Sub Accounts ”). As a Primary Account holder on the Service, we ask you to provide us with certain categories of information such as: (1) personally identifiable information, which is information that identifies you and your family members personally, including your first and last name, email address, phone numbers and home addresses (“ Personal Information ”); and (2) demographic information, including information about you and your family member’s gender, age, and potentially other information that cannot be used alone to directly identify and contact you (“ Demographic Information ”).  Further, we may ask Sub Account holders over the age of thirteen (13) for Personal Information. We may collect this information through various forms and in various places on the Service, including account registration forms, contact us forms, or when you otherwise interact with the Service.  To the extent we combine Demographic Information with your Personal Information we collect directly from you on the Service, we will treat the combined data as Personal Information under this Policy.
In addition to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to submit to us via our Service, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies that automatically (or passively) store or collect certain information whenever you visit or interact with the Service (“ Usage Information ”). This Usage Information may be stored or accessed using a variety of technologies that may be downloaded to your personal computer, browser, laptop, tablet, mobile phone or other device (a “ Device ”) whenever you visit or interact with our Service. To the extent we associate Usage Information with your Personal Information we collect directly from you on the Service, we may treat it as Personal Information.
This Usage Information may include:
your IP address, UDID, or other unique identifier (collectively “ Device Identifiers ”).  A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device used to access the Service, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. Please note that, under the amended COPPA Rule, Device Identifiers fall under the category of Personal Information;
your Device functionality (including browser, operating system, hardware, mobile network information);
the URL that referred you to our Service;
the areas within our Service that you visit and your activities there, including remembering you and your preferences;
your Device location, which may include details such as your street name, city and state. Please note that if your device provides us with your specific location, it falls under the category of Personal Information;
your Device characteristics; and
certain other Device data, including the time of day, among other information.
Excluding Device Identifiers and exact Device location, Demographic Information and Usage Information are collectively “ Non-Personal Information ”, except to the extent combined with Personal Information.
When you visit and interact with the Service, Virtual Piggy and its third party service providers may also collect other Non-Personal Information (for example, a catalog of the Site pages you visit). This Non-Personal Information is generally collected through the Service using various methods and technologies to store or collect information (“ Tracking Technologies ”). Tracking Technologies may set, change, alter or modify settings or configurations on your Device. A few of the Tracking Technologies include, without limitation, the following (and subsequent technology and methods later developed):
Server Log Files. Your Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). This number is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever you visit the Site, along with the time(s) of your visit(s) and the page(s) that you visited. IP addresses may be used for purposes such as calculating Site usage levels, helping diagnose problems with the Site’s servers, and administering the Site. Collecting IP addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many websites.
Mobile Device Data. Your Device Identifier such as UDID, ODIN, Apple IFA, etc. and use analytic tools in connection therewith.

Certain environmental variables, such as your MAC address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, OS version, Internet browser, and Internet browser version may be automatically collected. These environmental variables are collected by most websites, and can be used to optimize your experience on the Site.
Cookies. A cookie is a small file placed on your computer’s hard drive when you visit a website. The cookie gives you a unique, random ID, and this ID enables our Site to readily recognize each user on a subsequent visit to our Site. For example, a cookie may indicate the preferences you selected on a prior visit. This facilitates more efficient browsing on subsequent visits, by using your preferences to customize the content and/or layout of our Site. We may use cookies in this fashion. We also use cookies to store encrypted user id/password to support a “remember me” option so that you do not have to log in again the next time you visit the Site. You are free to set your Web browsers to prevent the acceptance of cookies. However, if you do so, certain functionality of our Service may not work. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any Personal Information you submit while on our Site.
We may use Tracking Technologies for a variety of purposes, including:
Strictly Necessary. We may use cookies or other Tracking Technologies that we consider are strictly necessary to allow you to use and access our Service, including cookies required to prevent fraudulent activity, improve security or allow you to make use of shopping cart functionality.

Further information on this, and your opt-out choices, is found in Section 5 and Section 9 below.
We obtain your consent to our information storage or collection practices by providing you with transparent information in our Policy and Cookie Statement and providing you with the opportunity to make a choice to disable cookies as set forth above.

There may be other Tracking Technologies now and later devised and used by us in connection with the Service.  Further, third parties may use Tracking Technologies with our Service. You consent to potentially encountering third party Tracking Technologies in connection with use of our Service as described above and accept that our statements under this Policy do not apply to the Tracking Technologies or practices of such third parties.  However, some may offer you certain choices regarding their practices, and information we have been informed of regarding such choices is available here.

Our primary purpose for collecting information is to provide the Service. We use Personal Information in the following ways:
Purchase Transactions.  We use Personal Information, including credit card and other payment system information, to process requested purchase transactions initiated by a Child [c1] using the Service and to enable the delivery of products purchased using the Service.  Purchase and transaction information is used for reporting to Parents and participating merchants and processing transactions.
Notifications and Alerts. Email and telephone numbers, and internal Service messaging, are used to provide Primary and Sub Account holders (subject to COPPA requirements) with transaction alerts, approval requests or other reporting, notices or alerts.  We also use a Parent’s email address to send an initial email notice to Parents regarding their Child’s use of the Sites, and will use it for subsequent notice regarding their Child’s activities unless the Parent elects to discontinue such notices. Additionally, we send invitations and alerts to individuals as requested by the Primary or Sub Account holder, including invitations to provide funding, purchase a gift or view a wishlist.

9. Third Party Advertisers.
The Service uses third parties to serve advertisements on the Service and uses third-party analytics and other service providers to evaluate and provide us and/or third parties with information about the use of the Service and viewing and serving of ads and of our content. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements, which may be based on your visits to the Service.  Third-party ad serving enables us to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested.
The Service’s third-party ad network and exchange providers, the advertisers, the sponsors and/or traffic measurement services themselves set and access their own cookies (including Flash cookies), web beacons, and other Tracking Technologies on your Device and track certain Usage Information regarding users of your Device via a Device Identifier.  These third-party Tracking Technologies may be set to, among other things: (a) help deliver advertisements to you that you might be interested in; (b) prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times; and (c) understand the usefulness to you of the advertisements that have been delivered to you.  You acknowledge and agree that associated technology may access and use your Device and set or change settings on your Device in connection with the associated operations.  Note that any images (or any other parts of content) served by third parties in association with third-party ads or other content may serve as web beacons, which enable third parties to carry out the previously described activities.
Third-party Tracking Technologies are not controlled by us, even if they use our technology to help store or collect data. Statements regarding our practices do not apply to the methods for collecting information used by these third-party advertisers and others or the use of the information that such third parties collect. We do however work with third parties to make efforts to have you provided with the information on their practices and any available opportunity to exercise choice. The relevant third party’s terms of service, privacy policy, permissions, notices and choices should be reviewed regarding their collection, storage and sharing practices. We make no representations regarding the policies or practices of third-party advertisers or advertising networks or exchanges or related third parties.
However, some may offer you certain choices regarding their practices, and information we have been informed of regarding such choices is available directly below in this Section 9. Further, while we use a variety of companies to serve advertisements on the Service, you may wish to visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp, which provides information regarding this practice by Network Advertising Initiative (“ NAI ”) members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including the “opt-out” procedures of NAI members.  Opting out of one or more NAI members only means that those NAI members no longer may be allowed under their own rules to deliver targeted content and/or ads to you, which may affect this and other sites, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads.  Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different Device or change web browsers, your NAI opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective.  Additional information is available on the NAI’s web site accessible by the above link.

The security of your Personal Information is important to us.  We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the information you submit to us.  Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or other digital media can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  Once we receive your information, we use HTTPS encryption to transmit sensitive information such as credit card numbers and user ID and passwords.  All Personal Information you provide for the Oink Service is stored on secure third party infrastructure in accordance with their security procedures and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard.  User ID and password are used to access and view the Personal Information and certain other Oink account information as well as to make a transaction using the Oink Service.  We recommend that you do not divulge and you inform your Sub Account holders, if any, that they not divulge Oink user IDs and passwords to anyone.  Ultimately, you are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your Oink User IDs and passwords and Virtual Piggy shall not be responsible or liable in any way for damages or losses resulting from a Primary or Sub Account holder divulging or not protecting their user IDs and/or passwords.

11. Changing or Deleting Information
If you or your Sub Account holders would like to review, correct, update or delete Personal Information or Non-Personal Information, you or they, as appropriate, may do so by logging into their Oink account and correcting, updating, or in some cases deleting such information.  Please note that if required information (marked with an asterisk) is deleted, the Service may not function and may no longer be used in whole or in part.  A Primary Account holder may elect to close their account, in which event, any Sub Account profiles and Primary account will be deactivated such that the users cannot log-in nor transact.  Additionally, credit card expiration dates and any payment account tokens (e.g., PayPal) will be deleted.  If a Parent would like to remove a Sub Account profile from their Primary account, we will delete or null the Sub Account profile name, username, password, email address, and phone number, as applicable.  If you would like us to delete your Personal Information, send this request to support@oink.com. If there have not been any transactions on the account, we will delete or null Primary Account holder last name, shipping address, payment account information, Sub Account profile name, username, password, email addresses, and phone numbers, each as applicable within 30 days of receipt of your request.  In the event there have been transactions on the account, we will delete or null this same information except as required to support or report such transactions.  If a Primary Account holder is unable to correct, update, or delete their information as described above or wishes to terminate his/her Sub Account and use of the Services, they should contact Virtual Piggy at privacy@oink.com with their specific request.  Please note that, as more fully explained above, we need to retain certain transaction information for business record keeping and reporting purposes, and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, there may also be residual information that remains within our databases and other records, which may not be removed.
We are not responsible for removing information from the databases of third parties with whom we have already shared information.  We will retain your information for as long as your Oink account is active or as needed to provide you services or to maintain reasonable business records, but undertake no duty to do so.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, we will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements as permitted or required by applicable law.
If you no longer wish to receive electronic newsletters and/or promotional emails that we send to you, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the opt-out instructions included in each newsletter or email.  If your attempts to opt-out by these methods are unsuccessful, you should email us at privacy@oink.com with your request. Even if you unsubscribe (i.e., opt-out) to commercial emails, we may still contact you for transactional purposes (e.g., to respond to a customer service request).
