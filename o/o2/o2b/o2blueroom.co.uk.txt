12. FAQS on other related issues
a) Location information
b) How can you avoid receiving SPAM?
a) Location Information
Some web and mobile telephone services that you use from your O2 mobile may require us to disclose information about the location of your mobile phone to third parties. By using location-based services such as 'Find My Nearest ATM' or 'Friend Finder', you consent to O2 disclosing your information to third parties required to provide you with the service. The information that we provide to third parties will be an approximate location only.
However if do not wish your location to be disclosed for some or all services, please call our Location Services Privacy Controller (LSPC) by dialling 1300, free of charge from your O2 mobile (for non-O2 customers, please contact your network provider). If you have contacted the LSPC and decided to withhold your location information you may not be able to access certain services that require this information.
Link to Glossary
Location Services Privacy Controller (LSPC)
You can control how the location of your mobile is used to provide you with services by dialling the LSPC on 1300, free of charge from your O2 mobile.
You can choose a location status from the list below by following the voice prompts
a. You can be found by all location services, including those that allow other user to find you. These services may include those such as "Find a buddy" type services where you and your friends can find each other
b. You can be found by all location services that you use from your own mobile.
These services will only locate you each time you use the service, by calling or sending a text message for example
c. You can be found by all O2 location services but not by services that require your location to be disclosed to any third party services
You cannot be found by any location services, except by the emergency services in the event that you make an emergency call from your mobile. Link to Glossary
b) How can you avoid receiving Spam?
Think before you give out your e-mail address
Try to avoid giving your main e-mail address on web sites, chatrooms, newsgroups or to companies. There are many places online that provide free e-mail accounts. You could set up a separate account to use when signing up to an Internet service, or for online shopping. This way your main e-mail address cannot be "harvested" by spammers. Avoid forwarding chain letters or petitions. These lists of addresses can be used by spammers.
Never reply to spam
This includes the notorious "click here to unsubscribe" trick. While it looks as if you are being given a chance to opt out of receiving further unsolicited e-mail, in fact you will be letting the spammer know that your e-mail address is active, leading to yet more spam being sent. Don't click it - just delete the e-mail.
You should also avoid trying to spam the spammers, you will end up being blacklisted as a spammer yourself.
Blocks and Filters
Your Webmail has simple spam blocking features already. Have a look for the pages on "spam" or "junk mail" in the 'Help' section of the Webmail service. If you are downloading emails onto your home PC, then email your Internet Service Provider or search their website to find out about spam blocking services they may offer. There are various software programs to help you block spam.
