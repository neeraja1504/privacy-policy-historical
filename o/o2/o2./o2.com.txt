Our Privacy Policy
Your privacy is extremely important to us. This policy explains what personal information we have, how we use it and how you can check and update any of your personal information. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, “we” means Telefónica UK Limited and other companies in the same group.
Why do we collect your personal information?
We collect information to help manage your account:
To deliver products and services relevant to you (whether we provide them or not).
To improve our products and services and develop new ones.
And to manage our network and help us run and grow our business.
We also collect information so we can tell you about our products and services, other companies' products and services or allow selected partners to tell you directly about their products or services.
The law also requires us to keep some information. Occasionally this information is anonymised so you can't be identified.
To find out more, click on any of the sections below.
The type of Information we have
Where do we get your information?
How we use your information.
How we share your information.
Why we keep hold of your information.
How to check and update your information.
Product specific terms.
Other important things to know.
The type of information we have
The information we have about you includes things like who you are, how you use your O2 products and services, where you use our network, and how you pay for your services.
Who you are includes:
Your name, address, gender, age, interests, etc.
Your debit or credit card details, bank details and other payment information.
Your interests and preferences.
How you use your O2 products and services includes:
Your call, text, surfing and billing records.
Details about your usage of any other products we supply to you, such as our apps. This includes the date and time you use them, how long for, where you use them and how much it costs.
We don't look at the content of your messages or listen to your calls (unless you are talking to one of our customer service advisors).
Where you use our network:
So we can connect you to our network, and for some of the purposes mentioned in this Privacy Policy, we need to know your location when you make or receive phone calls, messages or use the internet. We call this network location. It works by finding you through nearby phone masts, providing us with a rough location so we can put calls through or connect you to the internet.
If you don't want us to share your network location or some or all of your services, call us on 1300. It's free from your O2 mobile.
Your smartphone might also have a Global Positioning System (GPS) location, that's used by your phone and certain apps. It's more accurate than network location alone, because it uses satellites. If you're using some of our apps, like Priority, or apps connected to O2 Drive we, or our partners, might collect some of your GPS location information.
GPS location is different from network location. We don't control it, so there's no need to call 1300. GPS is based on satellites and is set up on the phone itself. Look at your phone's settings to configure it. Remember, if you choose not to share your location, you might not be able to use certain services that need to know where you are for those services to work.
What you do with your O2 account(s):
This includes things such as when and how much you top up and pay your bill, or how often and why you access your account with us.
Where do we get your information?
We collect information mainly when you sign up with us, contact us and when you use our products and services.
For example when you:
Register as or enquire about becoming an O2 customer or take part in market research.
Get in touch with us to ask something.
Buy from us – whether it's in an O2 shop, online, over the phone or somewhere else.
Enter any surveys, promotions, competitions or prize draws.
Make changes to, or close your O2 account.
Go to our website, or the sites of any other companies in the Telefónica Group, or Sites used for market research purposes.
Submit content, including photographs, or comments to participate in discussion threads.
Use any of our networks – mobile, wifi or other O2 products and services.
Sign up for a service with us that means we need to check with credit reference and fraud prevention agencies.
Sign up for an insurance product that means we need you to provide sensitive personal data, including any medical or criminal record information, about you or a third party.
Apply for a job with us online.
We also collect information from other sources, including business directories and other commercially or publicly available sources. If we need to conduct a credit check, we will receive information from credit reference agencies. If you take part in market research for us we will also collect information from third party website or social media you access from our Sites, in accordance with the privacy policies of those respective websites and social media.
How we use your information
We use and analyse your information to keep in touch with you and to supply and improve our products and services. We will also use your information to tell you about products and services that we think may interest you.  Sometimes we'll combine and anonymise this information so you won't be identified.
In particular, this means using your information to:
Manage your account and help you to manage your account.
Sort out a payment, put your order through our system or send you an order.
Get in touch with you (e.g. if we need to tell you about any problems with a service).
Look at markets, write reports or carry out research and number crunching. And, if the law allows it, look at information about you (including the calls you make, your spending, what you use the internet for and where you are when you do it).
Keep things secure and prevent crime and fraud.
Manage our network and your use of our network.
Look into any complaints or questions you may raise.
Check whether you qualify for credit or other products, services and offers. We use automated systems to analyse your information to help us make fair and objective decisions about whether we can give you (and members of your household) credit, credit-related services, other similar facilities or insurance.  As part of this we may also need to check the financial status of people connected to you (e.g. your spouse or other family members).Trace and recover debts, manage credit, detect and prevent fraud and money laundering.
Trace and recover debts, manage credit, detect and prevent fraud and money laundering
Recover any money you might owe us.
Assign your debt to permitted third parties and look after any credit you might have.
Or to:
Tell you if we've changed the way a service works, or tell you about a new service that we think may interest you
Check what you're interested in or eligible for, so we can offer (and develop) relevant products and services, and surveys.
Improve our (and third party partner) products and services and develop new ones.
Send you information about our products and services (or those from selected third parties we think you'd be interested in) by phone, post, email, text, picture message, online banner advertising, or other ways. For some of this marketing activity we need your consent and, in those circumstances, we will only send you messages if you have asked to receive them. You can check and update your current preferences at any time in My O2.
Tell you about products and services from other companies we think you'd be interested in, or let selected third parties tell you directly about their products and services. Again, we will only send you marketing messages if you’ve previously given us your consent in your preferences in My O2.
We are allowed to use your information in these ways and share the information as described below because:
We need to so that we can provide you with products and services and to manage your account with us.
We need to use some of your information to comply with legal and regulatory obligations (such as legal obligations to keep details of calls made by customers for a certain period of time).
Some of our use of your information is necessary for our legitimate business interests (such as conducting market research and minimising our credit and fraud risks).
You have given your consent to us using your data in relation to some forms of use. For example, in relation to using your information to send you marketing messages. You can opt out of this at any time.
You have obtained consent from any third parties whose personal or sensitive information you provided to us in your application for and / or performance of O2 products and services, (like O2’s insurance products), for us to be receive and process that information for those purposes.
How we share your information
In connection with the purposes described above, we may share your information (and the information of any third parties you have included in an application for and performance of an O2 insurance product or service) with others.
This might mean sharing that information with:
Our partner companies or agencies and their sub-contractors or prospective partners who help us run our services, for example our billing or customer service centres.
Other companies in the Telefónica Group. This includes, Telefonica Dynamic Insights and their respective partners, agents and sub-contractors.
Insurance providers when you take out a policy through us.
Third parties whose products and services we market to you (where you have given permission to receive such messages).
Third parties whose offers you sign up to, for example through the Priority app..
Credit reference and fraud prevention agencies. When we check your credit score with a credit reference agency, the information that we give them (including details of your credit application and financial details) as well as the fact that we have requested that search will also be recorded by the credit reference agency.  We exchange information with credit reference agencies on payment performance and your financial situation on an ongoing basis and this information could be used by us and third parties to make future credit assessment decisions. Your data will also be linked to the data of your spouse, any joint applicants or other financial associate.
Other communications companies.
New or prospective owners of Telefónica UK Limited.
We might also share your information:
With any public authority or law enforcement agency (if they ask for it).
To comply with law or regulations, or for possible legal proceedings.
If you give us personal information that's wrong or we find out (or think) you're responsible for fraud. In these circumstances we might share your information with third parties such as law enforcement agencies, credit reference agencies and other affected third parties.
If one of our partners who are processing information for us are compelled to do so by law.
If there's an emergency and we think you or other people are at risk.
Why we keep hold of your information
There are certain reasons we have to keep hold of your information.
We keep information while you're our customer or after you've left us, but only as long as we need it for the purposes described above. How long we keep it depends very much on the type of information and purpose.
For example, we might need to sort out disagreements, stop fraud and abuse, prove that you had an account with us or follow our legal obligations. Or the police may need it as evidence. We may also keep information about how you use our products or services.
In each case, the length of time that we, or credit reference of fraud prevention agencies, need to keep the information may be different, but we will only keep the information for as long as we need it.

You have a number of legal rights in relation to the information that we hold about you, including:
The right to request details of the information we have about you.
The right to withdraw your consent to the use of your information where we are relying on that consent (for example, you can opt out of receiving marketing messages from us). Please note that we may still be entitled to process your information if we have another legitimate reason (other than consent) for doing so.
In some circumstances, you have the right to receive some of your information in a usable format and/or request we transmit that data to a third party where this is technically feasible. Please note that this right only applies to information which you have provided to us.

The right to ask that we erase your information in certain circumstances. Please note that there may be circumstances where you ask us to erase your information but we are legally entitled to retain it.

The recipient company might have signed up a contract obliging them to protect your information.
The recipient is located in the US and is a certified member of the EU-US Privacy Shield scheme.
