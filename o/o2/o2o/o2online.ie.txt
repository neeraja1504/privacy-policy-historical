About this Privacy Notice
This Privacy Notice tells you what personal data is processed by Three in relation to you, the purposes for which it is processed and the manner and duration of the processing. This information is provided in fulfilment of Three’s duty to process data in a manner which is fair, lawful and transparent, and to provide information relating to the processing at the time of collection of that data. You should read this Privacy Notice prior to providing any personal to Three and refer to it at any time should you have queries regarding the use of your personal data.
About Data Protection
Three processes personal data in accordance with the requirements of Data Protection law. This law includes the Irish Data Protection Acts and the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”).
Under Data Protection law, you are the “Data Subject” in respect of any personal data relating to you. “Personal Data” is any information which relates to an identifiable natural person. It does not include information relating to a company or other legal entity.
Depending on whether you are a customer of Three Ireland (Hutchison) Limited, or Three Ireland Services (Hutchison) Limited (formerly O2), one or both of those companies is the “Data Controller” in respect of this data. This Privacy Notice applies to both companies, and collectively refers them as “Three”.
Three may engage third parties (other than its own employees) to provide services to it. Any of those third parties who process personal data on our behalf is a “Data Processor”.
“Processing” means any action performed on personal data, including collection, storage, copying, consulting, disclosure or destruction.
“Legal Basis” Data Controllers may not process personal data except on one of a limited number of legal bases. One of these bases is consent. Where consent is the legal basis, Three is required to stop processing the data if you withdraw your consent. However, other legal bases are relied on by Three, meaning that we can continue to process your personal data for as long as that legal basis remains valid. For example, where we process your data in order to perform our contract with you, we are permitted to continue to process it for as long as you remain our customer and for a reasonable period thereafter.
Three has a Data Protection Officer, who is contactable at
