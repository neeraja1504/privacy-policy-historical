Privacy Policy | OnSugar
This privacy statement ("Privacy Policy") covers all the websites and services owned, affiliated or operated by Sugar Publishing, Inc. (collectively "Sugar Publishing", "we", "us", "our"). Sugar Publishing knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy. By visiting the Sugar Publishing websites, submitting information or using any of our products or services, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and consent to having your data transferred to and processed in the United States.
What Does This Privacy Policy Cover? This Privacy Policy covers Sugar Publishing’s treatment of personal information that Sugar Publishing gathers when you are on the Sugar Publishing websites and when you use Sugar Publishing services. Also, this Privacy Policy covers Sugar Publishing’s treatment of any personal information that Sugar Publishing’s business partners share with Sugar Publishing. This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that Sugar Publishing does not own or control, or to individuals that Sugar Publishing does not employ or manage.
What Personal Information About Users Does Sugar Publishing Collect? Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to personalize and improve our service. We collect the following types of information from our users:
Information You Provide to Us:
We may receive and store any information you enter on our websites or provide to us in any other way, such as your name, email address, and other information you provide. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features, such as posting comments to our websites, creating a user profile or receiving email alerts. The personal information you provide is used for such purposes as responding to your requests for certain products and services customizing the advertising content you see and communicating with you.
Registration: In order for you to use certain parts of our websites or take advantage of certain Sugar Publishing’s services, you may be required to complete a registration form and provide the requested information about you.
When you use our websites, you may, among other things, set up your profile, form relationships, send messages, perform searches and queries, create StyleBooks, comment and transmit information through various channels. In most cases, we retain your information so that you can return to view saved lists or sent messages. When you update your information, we usually keep a back-up copy of the prior version. We collect this information in order to provide you our services and offer you a more personalized and relevant experience on our websites.
You post information at your own risk. Although we allow you to set privacy options that limit access to your pages, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot control the actions of other users with whom you may choose to share your pages and information. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that information you post on the website will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the website. You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of your information may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other users have copied or stored your information.
Email Alerts: In order to receive an email alert every time a new story is posted on one of our websites, you are required to submit your email address.
Automatic Information:
We may receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. Sugar Publishing may automatically receive and record certain "traffic data" on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, Sugar Publishing cookie information, the page you requested, and your communications and interaction with our other website registrants. Sugar Publishing uses this traffic data to, among other things, help diagnose problems with its server, analyze trends and administer our websites.
Generally, our service may automatically collect usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our websites and its components. This data is only used in the aggregate, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of collective data enables us to figure out how often users use parts of our websites, so we can make our websites appealing to as many users as possible. In addition, we may provide statistical information to our partners about how our users, collectively, use our websites. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use their areas and our websites, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal Web experience. We also collect and use information for internal purposes. For example, if you are a registered user of the Sugar Publishing email and/or subscription based services, we may keep records in your account history of your complaints about other registered users online behavior, and any reported violation of our Terms of Use that you or someone on your account may have committed.
Many companies offer programs that help you to visit websites anonymously. While Sugar Publishing will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these programs are available.
Email Communications:
We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from Sugar Publishing if your computer supports this type of program, in order to help us make emails more interesting and helpful. We may also send out emails with news or promotions. If you do not want to receive email or other mail from us, please notify us by email at onsugarhelp@sugarinc.com and include sufficient information for us to identify your account.
Information from Other Sources:
For purposes such as improving personalization of our service, we may receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information. For our ShopStyle brand services, this may include details of the purchases (and any associated returns) you make at retailers where you were referred by us (excluding any credit card information).
What about Cookies?
Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we may transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our website are visited and by how many people. Sugar Publishing cookies do not collect personal information, and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personal information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or email address is.
The "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies. We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of Sugar Publishing’s most attractive features.
Some of our business partners may use cookies on our websites (for example, advertisers). These cookies allow the server to recognize your computer, for example, each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows advertising networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements. However, we have no access to or control over these cookies and this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by our business partners or advertisers.
Third Party cookies: We use third-party advertising companies such as TACODA to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click here.
