Privacy Policy
ON Semiconductor respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. This privacy statement explains our policies and practices while you visit our site. Through this disclosure, we intend to provide you a level of comfort and confidence in how we collect, use and safeguard personal and other information that we collect or that you provide through this website. By using the site, you agree to the terms of this privacy statement.
Data Collected
We collect two types of information: personal and demographic. Personal information is any information that is specific to your identification such as name, address, phone number, email, payment card, resumes, and investor interest. Demographic information is information that cannot be associated with you personally such as, domain information, zip codes and areas of interest. When you provide information for a third party, such as his or her name email and phone number, we assume that the third party has authorized you to do so.
Use of Data
When you request a service, place an order, submit feedback, submit a resume, or participate in a seminar or survey, it is necessary for you to offer certain personal information about yourself so that we may serve your needs. We will not send you information unless you specifically request it or we feel that the information would benefit your business needs. If you decide that you do not want to receive further information, simply contact us and request to be removed from the contact list. When you order a sample from us, a customer representative may contact you. The demographic information collected through our site is used to evaluate how our site is used and how it can be improved. It may also be used for marketing, recruiting, and investment analysis.

Please note that cookies cannot read information on your hard drive. We use cookies to measure our web trafficking processes, so that we may make our site more efficient. We also use cookies to offer you certain services and to customize your visit, and we may use third-party service providers who may use cookies to support our effort to improve our site. You may choose to turn off cookies completely, but you will not be able to use certain site services, such as the shopping cart.
If you are a registered user, you can specifically request that our site remembers your login information. By doing so, you are allowing us to place a permanent cookie onto your computer.
We use software such as Google Analytics, a first-party cookie that allows us to see information on user website activities including, but not limited to page views, source and time spent on website. The information is depersonalized and is displayed as numbers, meaning it cannot be tracked back to individuals. This will help to protect your privacy. Using software such as Google Analytics, we can see what content is popular on our website, and strive to give you more of the things you enjoy reading and watching. To opt out of Google Analytics analytic cookies across ON Semiconductor websites visit: http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout

We also may use cookies for ad serving through software such as Google’s DoubleClick, which places a cookie on your computer when you are browsing the web and visit a site using DoubleClick advertising (including some Google AdSense advertisements). This cookie is used to serve ads specific to you and your interests (”interest based targeting”). The ads served will be targeted based on your previous browsing history (For example, if you have been viewing sites about visiting Hawaii, you may see Hawaii hotel advertisements when viewing a non-related site, such as on a site about hockey). These cookies use “non-personally identifiable information”; they do NOT track personal information about you, such as your name, email address, physical address, telephone number, social security numbers, bank account numbers or credit card numbers. You can opt-out of this ad serving on all sites using this advertising by visiting: http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/html/opt-out.html
