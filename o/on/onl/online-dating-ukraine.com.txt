International Users

Order Information
We DO NOT sell or rent any personally identifiable information about you to any third party without your permission. We request information from the user on our order form. Here a user should provide contact information (like name and e-mail) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date etc.). This information is collected by a payment processing company, which provides highly secure payment processing for Us. Credit card information is encrypted using the SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) protocol and other standard industry practices. We do NOT keep your credit card information on our servers; once it is securely transmitted to the bank - it is deleted securely.
Security
The Website has security measures in place to prevent the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. We have a secure ordering process.
When our order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software available in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order and order confirmation forms, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing' (in non-secure mode).
The security and confidentiality of your personally identifiable information is extremely important to Us.  Technical, administrative, and physical security measures are used to protect customer information from unauthorized access and improper use.  From time to time, We review security procedures to consider appropriate new technology and methods.  Please be aware that, despite best efforts, no security measures are perfect or completely impenetrable.
Newsletter
If you wish to subscribe to Our newsletter, We ask for contact information such as email address. We will send you Our newsletters on a regular basis to the email address you provide. You can unsubscribe at any time. E-mail address will be kept strictly confidential and not given or sold to anyone except as required by law.
Third Parties
We do not sell, rent, share, or otherwise give your personally identifiable information to third parties for marketing purposes.  Often, companies receive extra income by providing customer contact information to marketing companies. We do not provide customer contact information to marketing companies.  For example, We will not give your address to junk mail (“direct marketing”) companies or email marketers (including “spammers”).  We may provide certain non-identifiable information to third parties for advertisement and marketing purposes regarding the Website. Such information will be groups of data, such as geographical location, time of day, or other demographic information of users but not any information that identifies you individually.
We do not provide your personally identifiable information to anyone, without your permission, unless compelled by law, in order to collect unpaid debts, to protect your security and safety, enforce the Terms of Use of the Website, or to protect the security and safety of the Website, third party websites, and Our employees.
Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document addresses only the use and disclosure of information We collect from you. If you disclose your information to others, whether they are our members or forum participants or other sites throughout the Internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them.
Affiliated Websites
We may share information about you with our parent, subsidiary, and other affiliated companies.
