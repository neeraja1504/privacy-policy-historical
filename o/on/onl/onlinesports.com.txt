Our advertising partner will make the data we provide it anonymous.
We also have partners that assist us with fulfillment and shipping in certain categories, and in those cases those partners receive a name and shipping address so that they can process and ship orders properly.
Also, OnlineSports.com may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information. OnlineSports.com may release account information when we believe, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to (i) comply with law, (ii) enforce or apply the terms of any of our user agreements or (iii) protect the rights, property or safety of OnlineSports.com, our users, or others.
