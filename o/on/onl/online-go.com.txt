Effective Date
This policy is effective as of 28/11/2005. We reserve the right to change this privacy policy from time to time, and any changes that we make will be effective immediately. Please check back periodically to ensure that you are up to date.
Information you provide to share
Any information that you choose to make public through your username and the settings you create in your preference screen will be visible to all those who register on this site. We are not responsible for any misuse of this information by third parties, so please only put up information you are happy being public domain. Any profane or offensive profiles will be edited to remove the profanity, and consistent re-entering of aforesaid inappropriate material may result in account suspension. If you feel that another user is being offensive, either over a game or in their profile, do let us know.
Registration information
Your password and email address are encrypted and kept securely in our database, and will not be supplied, for money or otherwise, to any third party organisation or person. We hate spam as much as the rest of the World, and the security of this information is of great importance to us.
Other logged information
Your IP address and other such information may well be logged, and will once again be stored securely without any public access. The only time we will choose to use this information is if there are reports of a) an account being hacked, or b) there are genuine problems with the site that may be due to ISPs or other reasons in which your IP address will help resolve the problem. As with emails, we place the highest priority in the security of this information.
External Links
This site contains links to sites outside of our control that we feel are relevant to online-go.com. We do not take responsibility for any damages that may be incurred by visiting these sites, though if we are informed and find that sites that we link to have become dangerous or unsuitable for children to view, they will be removed from the site.
