The name of the submitter, if over 18 years of age will be published. Submitters’ names under 18 years of age will be published if the submission is not clearly and prominently marked next to the student name “Do Not Publish”, and signed by the parent.  The materials if selected for inclusion at the web site or URL will be viewed and copied by the public, in general.  The editing sponsor noted on the particular web site or URL would be the organization which will view the submissions and the personal information included on it, see the Virtualology Submission Form.
As the editing sponsor will vary but is identified with a hyper link at the page where the submission is targeted, you must go to that site to determine exactly where the information has gone, who will do the actual judging and what criteria will be used.  For example, if the submission would be about Tyrannosaurus Rex, the URL to type on your computer would be tyrannosaurusrex.org.  At that page you will find the current editing sponsor.  By clicking on the area for the editing sponsor, you will be linked to a site hosted by that sponsor which will identify who will do the judging. It is the goal of Virtualology ™ to award approximately 75% of the sites to editing sponsors by September 2002. For more information click on editing sponsors.
The general information obtained at any of the Virtualology ™ sites will be used by Virtualology ™ to determine what additional information to include on a particular site or if additional sites should be added.  It will also be used to tailor future enhancements to the sites.
We may also use personal and general information to perform demographic studies.  By doing this, we can improve our sites to meet the needs of our visitors.  Should we merge personal information and general information, we will use reasonable efforts to maintain the integrity of the personal information.
