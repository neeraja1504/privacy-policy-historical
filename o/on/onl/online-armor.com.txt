Information about you
You can use our software trials without disclosing your name for up to 30 days and our freeware software without a time limit. If you order a full version and register your license key, the license will be associated with the email address you used to register your user account.
We would like to make our position clear at this point and assure you that we will never consciously install a hole in our series of products in order to allow access for a Government Trojan or similar software. If it ever comes to a legislative or court decision that forces us to do this then we will immediately notify our users of this fact. Especially the behavior analysis module of Emsisoft Anti-Malware does not distinguish between "benign" and "malignant" pests. As a user, you always have the possibility of immediately blocking a suspicious program.
