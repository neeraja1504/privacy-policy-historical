The following data protection information provides information on the type and scope of the processing of what is known as personal data. Personal data is information that is or can be directly or indirectly attributable to your person.
What is personal data?
Personal data is any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (hereinafter “data subject”).

What is anonymised data?
Each time you access the content of our website, general information is automatically stored (e.g. number and duration of users of individual sites, etc.). This information is not personal because it does not relate to an identified or identifiable individual, i.e. there is no way we can associate the information with any particular individual. The data is therefore processed in an anonymised form. Information of this kind is gathered for purely statistical purposes and is used by us for the optimisation of our Internet services.
The data processing via our services can essentially be divided into two categories:
All necessary data will be processed by online-casinos.com for the purpose of providing our services , in particular for the operation of our platform. In this way, we can ensure that we offer our visitors the best possible service. If third parties, e.g. partner sites, providers of online gaming, subcontractors, etc. are involved in the provision, your data will be passed on to them to the extent necessary in each individual case.
When the website is accessed , various pieces of information are exchanged between your device and our server. This may also involve personal data. The information collected in this way is used, among other things, to optimise our website or to display advertising in the browser of your device.
In accordance with the requirements of the GDPR, you have various rights which you are able to assert. This includes, among other things, the right to object to selected data processing, in particular data processing for advertising purposes. The ability to object is emphasised in the printing process. Should you have any questions regarding our data protection information, please feel free to contact us at any time. You will find our contact details below.
As a matter of principle, we process personal data only in accordance with the applicable statutory storage and safekeeping obligations or until the respective purpose ceases to apply, or if the processing is no longer required.
