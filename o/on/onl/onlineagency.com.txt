Online Agency Privacy Policy
At LevelField.com, Inc. d/b/a OnlineAgency.com (hereinafter referred to as "Online Agency"), we are committed to protecting the privacy of our customers and visitors. We know you care about what happens to your personal information on the Internet, so we think it is important for you to understand our privacy practices with respect to that personal information when you visit our web site (the "Site") and use our services. We have created this privacy statement to explain what kind of information we collect from our customers, what we do with that information, and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.
This privacy policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically.
1. What kind of information does Online Agency collect from you?
We offer on our web site various services to provide you with travel content, information, programs, promotions and packages, provide you with web tools to create and design your own travel web site, and/or host your web site for you (collectively referred to as the "Service"). ln order to provide you this Service as requested by you and to personalize this Service, we need to collect certain information about you. There are two types of information that we collect.
a. Your Contact Information
When you register for our Service, we ask you for information that personally identifies you, such as your legal name or business name, address, telephone number(s), email address, subscriber name or screen name, password used to access the Service, URL of your web site (if applicable), demographics, method of payment, and, if applicable, credit card number and billing address.
We may also ask you for additional personal information at various times such as when we run a promotion, hold a contest or conduct surveys. We may later request additional personal information from you in order to establish and maintain your account.

When you visit our Site or register for our Service, our web servers automatically collect limited information about your computer's connection to the Internet, including your IP address (which is a number that lets our server know the "location" of your computer on the Internet).

The information we collect helps us to verify your identity, establish an account for you, offer you more personalized features, deliver the Service to you, and improve our Service and Site. If you give us your permission, we use your contact information from the registration form to send you information about us and about promotions and events offered by us or third parties who help us to bring the Service to you ("Alliance Partners"). You may select to opt-out of future unsolicited mailings by following the opt-out provision below.
We also research your and other users' demographics and interests based on the information provided upon registration, in our server log files, or from surveys.
