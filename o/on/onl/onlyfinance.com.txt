We will only collect personal information about you as part of our product aggregation service, for example, in order to obtain a quote for car insurance. We may also be required to store details of your transaction(s) or financial information.

Third party providers whose products or services are listed on the results pages of www.onlyfinance.com for the purposes of obtaining an online quotation for you or comparing different products and services as requested by you;
The Financial Services Authority and/or other regulatory/governing bodies for the purposes of compliance monitoring;
Other third parties that might be able to offer, either an alternative product in the event that your preferred choice of third party provider does not approve your application or offers a less attractive product or service than you had originally applied for, or simply a product that meets the basic criteria of the type of product for which you have searched on www.onlyfinance.com
We would like to keep you updated by phone, e-mail or text of other products and services which we feel you may benefit from. For example, we may e-mail you letting you know how you could save money by switching product and services.
