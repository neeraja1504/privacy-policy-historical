Privacy Policy
As a website dealing with Online Behavior, we are aware of how important it is to be transparent about privacy. Below we explain how we collect data about you, what we will do with any potentially private data and how you can get in contact should you have any concerns.
Personally Identifiable Information Collected
Personal identifiable information is information that allows you to be identified as a particular person, such as your name, your address or phone number. First of all, we do not collect such data without your consent. We will only have access to your email in case you subscribe to our newsletter and, in order not to mistakenly email people that did not signup for it, we use a confirmed opt in process. In order to manage our newsletter subscription we use Mailchimp, you can check how they save their data on their privacy policy.
Tracking Clickstream Behavior And Advertisement
In order to track website usage we use Google Analytics which does not allow the collection of Personal Identifiable Information; therefore, we do not link the Personable Identifiable Data mentioned above to the data collected by Google Analytics. In order to understand better which data is collected as well as how they collect and save it, check their Terms of Service and their Safeguarding Policy. One important feature we use in Google Analytics that should be mentioned is the Remarketing Lists, which sets a third party cookie on visitors' browsers in order to target them with Advertising on the Google Distributed Network. You can read more about the feature in the help center.
Here are useful links if you would like to be removed from our Google Analytics tracking: 1. Opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads using the Ads Preferences Manager 2. Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on
Please also note that we use the Mailchimp ID (mcid) to track behavior across device through the User ID feature. So when a user registers to receive our newsletter, and clicks on an email, we will append the mcid to the URL and use it to measure usage across device using a 1st party cookie. We also save the information for future visits.
Information Transfers
We may buy or sell a company or property. If we sell a business, we may transfer some or all of your information as a part of the sale so that you will continue to receive the service being provided to you or for other business purposes.
