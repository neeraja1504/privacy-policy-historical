Privacy Policy
**Â **
Internet Research Bureau Private Limited (commonly known "IRB") is an Indian company registered with Ministry of Corporate Affairs, India, adheres the rules and regulations of Indian Government Companies Act. IRB owns and operates the website www.onlinesurveybureau.com. IRB is firmly committed to protect your privacy and avoid the dissemination of your personal information. You can directly contact us in case of any concerns related to our privacy practices at privacy@irbureau.com
Our Commitment
IRB is an online market research data collection company dedicated to provide high quality data to market research firms and other data collection companies. To protect your privacy and confidentiality is IRB's top priority. The data that IRB collects is only for market research purpose and IRB always reviews or publishes it as an aggregate information (about group). Individual information is never disclosed without your prior consent as it is irrelevant to the research conducted by IRB or IRB's clients. Registering as a member of Online Survey Bureau doesn't constitute the consent. Also this information is not disclosed to any other individual directly from IRB.
Personal Identifiable Information
At the time of registration site asks you to provide your basic personal information and once you are registered, it further asks you to update more personal and consumer information which helps us to find suitable surveys for you.
The site asks the below information:
E-Mail Address:
So that we can contact you for the surveys, reward information, newsletters, company updates and notifications.
Date of Birth:
So that we can update your age automatically and invite you to participate in a suitable survey.
Gender, Education Level, Household Income, Employment Status, Ethnic Background, Race, Zip Code/Postcode/Pin Code:
So that we can invite you to participate in a suitable survey.
Physical Address :
So that we can contact you to process the payment of reward earned by you.
Other Personal and Consumer Information:
So that we can invite you to participate in a research survey with the qualifying criteria that best matches to your profile information. If you are not a member of Online Survey Bureau and we collect the personal identification information (e.g. e-mail ID, Date of Birth, Gender, Household Income, Education Level, Employment status, State/Province Zip Code/Postcode/Pin Code and IP Address), the only reason is to route you to the right surveys matching to the information. We ask for your email ID so that we can inform you when you qualify a survey and/or win the sweepstakes. If you have opted for the follow-up surveys, we might contact you if we need additional feedback for the particular survey. Apart from this there is no other reason to collect your personal information.
Use of Personal Information
The personal identifiable information collected by IRB is only used for the market research studies and not for any other purposes. We don't sell or share personal identifiable information of its panel members or the individuals who are not registered with us to any individual or its clients without your prior consent. If personal indefinable information is required in any of the research surveys, there will be a DND Agreement (Do Not Disclose Agreement) signed between IRB and the client to avoid the further usage and dissemination of the data. Also we ask you for your consent to participate in such surveys before sending you to the client's end. Participating in such surveys is completely your discretion.
Children's Privacy Policy
Children under age of 15 years are not eligible to join IRB panel. If we need responses from the children under age of 15 years, we seek their parents/guardians approval.
Data Validation Policy
We time to time conduct the data validation of our panel members and non-panel members with the help of third party(s) involvement, to ensure the quality of survey data, honesty and integrity of responses and uniqueness of members. We reserve the rights to terminate the membership of any panelist(s) and restrict the user(s) to participate in future surveys from Online Survey Bureau, if any discrepancy is found in the process of data validation.
