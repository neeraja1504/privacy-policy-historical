1. INTRODUCTION
OnlinePiansit is committed to respecting the privacy rights and concerns of all users of the OnlinePiansit service provided on or through the website located at www.onlinepianist.com (the “OnlinePianist Site”), or on or through the software applications made available by OnlinePianist (we refer to the OnlinePianist Site and the software applications made available by OnlinePianist as the “Service Applications”, and we refer to the Service Applications and the service provided through the Service Applications, collectively, as the “OnlinePianist Service”). OnlinePianist has established and implemented this Privacy Policy to help you make informed decisions when using the OnlinePianist Service.
In this Privacy Policy, references we make to “OnlinePianist” (and “we”, “us” and “our”) means either Online Pianist N.T Ltd., an Israeli company, with its principal business address at 34 Yitzhak Sade St., Tel-Aviv, Israel 6721207.
THIS POLICY ANSWERS THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS:
What information do we collect about you and how do we use it? What choices do you have about the collection and use of your personal information? Will we share your personal information with third parties? What security measures do we take to safeguard your personal information? Who can I contact if I have any questions about this Privacy Policy? By accessing or using the OnlinePianist Service, whether on or through the OnlinePianist Site, or on or through our Service Applications, you consent to OnlinePianist’s collection, use, storage, deletion and disclosure of information relating to you as set forth in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is effective as of the date set forth above and is only applicable to the OnlinePianist Service and not to any other website or service that you may be able to access from the OnlinePianist Site or our Service Applications. If you use your Facebook log-in details to log-in to the OnlinePianist Service, or otherwise connect your accounts, or if you connect or link other third party social networking sites and services to your OnlinePianist account, such as Facebook or Twitter (“Social Networks”), the OnlinePianist Service will interact with them in a number of ways, as described to you in the OnlinePianist Terms of Service and/or when you log-in or connect. Your activities on your applicable Social Networks are covered by their respective privacy policies and terms of use. The Social Networks are made available by their respective corporate entities.
2. INFORMATION WE COLLECT
2.1 Registration and Your Account Information
Personal Information means information that can be used to identify and contact you, such as your name, email address, date of birth and gender, as well as various transaction related information, such as billing address and credit card number or other payment information (“Personal Information”). You do not need to submit Personal Information to access the OnlinePianist Site or aspects of the OnlinePianist Service, but if you do not disclose certain Personal Information to us, you will not be able to access important portions of the OnlinePianist Service. When you create an account, or access or use your account for purposes of accessing the OnlinePianist Service, we may require you to provide us with certain Personal Information. You will also select a password for your account. Your email address and password will be used together so you can securely access and maintain your account.
You may also access the Service Applications or use certain aspects of the OnlinePianist Service by creating a new, or using your existing, Social Network log-in credentials. By utilizing your Social Network log-in credentials to log into the OnlinePianist Service (including on or through any of the Service Applications) or by linking your OnlinePianist Service account with any Social Network account, you expressly authorize OnlinePianist to receive, and for such Social Network account to share, certain of your information that is available on or through your Social Network account, including, without limitation, your profile information, friends names, your photos, privacy settings, and certain other information that will be disclosed to you (and authorized by you) during the log-in process; and you also authorize OnlinePianist to generate and publish on your Social Network news feed and/or timeline actions you take on the OnlinePianist Service, and to allow you to interact with your Social Network friends on the OnlinePianist Service. If linked, you agree to allow your Social Networks to receive information concerning the actions you take on the OnlinePianist Service. When you discover, play, download and share music or other content on or through the OnlinePianist Service, you authorize OnlinePianist to share and/or publicly display such activity on or through: (i) the OnlinePianist Service; and (ii) the Social Networks.
For clarity, as a result of your creation of an OnlinePianist account with your Social Network log-in credentials, and/or by linking your OnlinePianist Service account with any Social Network account, and/or by providing us certain additional information, we may obtain certain of your personally identifiable information, such as your name, email address, date of birth and gender, as well as various transaction related information, such as billing address and credit card number or other payment information, including any such information that you previously provided to your Social Networks.
2.2 Customer Service
We provide customer service support through email and through our support pages located at onlinepianist.com/contact. In order to provide customer support, we may ask for your email address and other account information depending upon the nature of your support request. We only use information received from customer support requests, including email addresses and other account information, for customer support services and we do not transfer or share information obtained from support requests with any third parties (other than service providers that may be assisting us in providing services to you).

Like many websites, we employ "cookies" in certain areas of the OnlinePianist Site to allow us to make your online experience more convenient. Cookies are small bits of electronic information that a website sends to a visitor's browser and are stored on the visitor's hard drive. Each user is assigned a “cookie ID” from our OnlinePianist Site domain in connection with the registration process. We use cookies, including your cookie ID, for the following purposes: to store a user's log-in identity and password and automatically populate the log-in fields for you when you re-access the OnlinePianist Site; to monitor irregular account behavior and implement fraud protection rules; and to generate and compile anonymous, aggregated statistics that allow us to understand how users navigate our site and to help us improve it.

2.4 LOG INFORMATION
We also keep track of your interaction with the OnlinePianist Service, whether through the OnlinePianist Site, or our Service Applications. Specifically, our servers automatically record information that your browser (or our Service Applications) sends whenever you interact with the OnlinePianist Service. This information includes your Internet Protocol address (IP address), your cookie ID, your browser type and version, which aspects of the OnlinePianist Service you use and when and how long you use them, and how you otherwise access the OnlinePianist Service. For example:

Our servers log and can identify which of the available mobile Service Applications you have installed (and on which mobile platforms), what songs you store on them and what songs you play.
3. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION
As a general matter, we use the information that you provide to us or that we obtain from the Social Networks linked to your OnlinePianist Service account to process your user registration, and to provide, enhance and personalize the OnlinePianist Service.

Specifically, we use the information that you provide to us (or that we obtain from any applicable Social Network) to:

You may unsubscribe from receiving future emails at any time (see “Opting Out of Receiving Communications from Us” below).
We will use your Personal Information to verify your credit card or other payment information, and we will use your credit card or other payment information to allow you to pay for any subscription services or downloads you purchase. Additionally, we may use Personal Information that you provide, or that we learn about you to otherwise improve your use of the OnlinePianist Site and the OnlinePianist Service. We will also use this information to help us quickly and efficiently respond to inquiries and requests, and otherwise enhance our OnlinePianist offering for our users.
Facebook Account:
We may provide your personal information to Facebook in order to provide you, or other Facebook users who share similar interests as you, targeted advertising, promotions and special offers through your or such users’ Facebook accounts. Your personal information will be hashed when it is provided to Facebook. Hashing summarizes text into a short fingerprint that cannot be decrypted and does not allow the original information to be recovered later by decryption. Facebook will calculate the hash of the personal information that you and other users provide to them via their website and services, and compare those hashed results with the hashed personal information we provide Facebook to match you and other users who share similar interests as you to your Facebook accounts. If we provide any hashed personal information that Facebook does not already have, no matches will be made. At no time will Facebook have access to any original, discernible personal information it does not already have. We encourage you to review Facebook’s privacy policies to obtain information regarding Facebook’s information collection, use and disclosure policies.
4. YOUR CHOICES ABOUT THE COLLECTION AND USE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
4.1 Opting Out of Receiving Communications from Us
If, at any point in time, you are not interested in direct marketing emails from us, you will be able to opt-out of receiving them by clicking on the specified link in any given email communication or by modifying your personal settings. Please note that you may not be able to unsubscribe from certain non-marketing related correspondence from us, including messages relating to your OnlinePianist account.
4.2 Control of Your Information
You may have the right to access, update and correct inaccuracies in your Personal Information in our custody or control, subject to certain exceptions prescribed by law. You can access and update most of your Personal Information through the use of the OnlinePianist Site. You may also request access, updating and correction of inaccuracies in other Personal Information we have in our custody or control by using the contact information provided below. To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as requesting a password) to verify your identity before granting you access or allowing you to make any corrections or updates. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your password and account information at all times.
Additionally, in the event you no longer want the OnlinePianist Service to publish your OnlinePianist activity on your Social Network news feeds and/or timelines, or want to otherwise limit the ways in which the OnlinePianist Service interacts with your Social Network accounts, you can always disable aspects of this feature by changing your application settings in your Social Network accounts.

We will not sell or rent your email address or any of your Personal Information. However, to operate the OnlinePianist Service, we may share your information in the following ways:
5.1 As Aggregated Data
We will share aggregate statistical and demographic information, which does not personally identify you, about our users and their use of the OnlinePianist Service (including on the OnlinePianist Site or through our Service Applications) with suppliers of advertisements and potential affiliate partners.

You should refer to the privacy policies and statements of other websites or contact the respective webmasters of those websites to obtain information regarding their information collection, use and disclosure policies. When you have clicked on a third party logo displayed on the OnlinePianist Site which links you to a different website, you acknowledge that our Privacy Policy no longer applies and you must read the privacy policy of the third party site to see how your Personal Information will be handled on their website.

In addition, we restrict access to Personal Information to our employees, independent contractors and agents who need to know this information in order to develop, operate and maintain the OnlinePianist Service.

No server, computer or communications network or system, or data transmission over the Internet or mobile service can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, however. As a result, while we strive to protect user information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or through the use of any aspect of the OnlinePianist Service and we accept no liability for any breach of security or any unintentional disclosure, loss or misuse of any such information or data or for the actions of any third parties that may obtain any such information or data. You acknowledge and agree that you provide such information and engage in such transmissions at your own risk. Once we receive a transmission from you, we will endeavor to maintain its security on our systems.
We continue to store your Personal Information for so long as it is necessary to provide you our OnlinePianist Service and periodically destroy old Personal Information in accordance with our company policies, including when it is no longer necessary in order to offer you the OnlinePianist Service. In most cases, we will keep one archival copy of your information to allow us to comply with laws or respond to legal processes.
