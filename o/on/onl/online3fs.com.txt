We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including packaging, mailing and delivering purchases, answering customer questions about products or services, sending postal mail and processing event registration. We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.
Online3FS Corp will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Online3FS or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Online3FS Corp and its family of Websites, and, (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Online3FS, its Websites, or the public.
