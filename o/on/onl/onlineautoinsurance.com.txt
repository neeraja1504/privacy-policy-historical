* From our partners and service providers (including, for example, business partners, analytics vendors, advertising networks and search information providers).
We may use this information to help us maintain the accuracy of the information we collect, personalize your experience with the Services, target our communications so that we can inform you of products, services or other offers that may be of interest to you, to measure ad quality and responses, and for internal business analysis or other business purposes.
4. **Combination of Information**

2. **How We Use Your Information for Interest-Based Advertising**
We may use third parties to measure and target advertisements on our behalf about our products and services that are tailored to your online interests. We allow these third-party companies to use cookies, web beacons, pixels and similar technologies to collect certain data and other information about your online activity. This information is used to display advertisements for us on the Site or across other websites, mobile applications, social media or online services that you use, or to send you promotional materials or offers via email or direct mail.
We also may display interest-based ads through Facebook, Twitter, or other social media platforms or websites. This is done through the Facebook Custom Audiences, Twitter Tailor Audiences, or other similar business tools. These tools allow us to personalize our ads based on your shopping experience with us, without having to share your personal information with these social media platforms. We do this only by sharing hashed information (which converts your email or phone number to a unique string of numbers and letters) that the social media platform then matches data against its own data for the limited purpose of serving advertisements (either directly to you or to other lookalike audiences). The matched and unmatched hashes are then deleted, and are not used for any other purpose.
For information on your choices with respect to interest-based ads, see the "Interest Based Advertising Choices" section below.
