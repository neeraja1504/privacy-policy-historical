You may find out more about how Braintree stores and uses your payment information by accessing the Braintree Privacy Policy.

We also use Google, a third-party analytics provider, to collect information about Services usage and the users of the Services, including demographic and interest-level information. Google uses cookies in order to collect demographic and interest-level information and usage information from users that visit the Services, including information about the pages where users enter and exit the Services and what pages users view on the Services, time spent, browser, operating system, and IP address.

In addition to standard cookies and web beacons, the Services can also use other similar technologies to store and read data files on your computer. This is typically done to maintain your preferences or to improve speed and performance by storing certain files locally.

Do Not Track
Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome) incorporate a "Do Not Track" ("DNT") or similar feature that signals to websites that a user does not want to have his or her online activity and behavior tracked. If a website that responds to a particular DNT signal receives the DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain information about the browser’s user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform. For this reason, many website operators, including Onehub, do not respond to DNT signals.

Where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you.
Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.
Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.
We will only use your Personal Data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If we need to use your Personal Data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.

How We Share Information
We may share Personal Data collected via the Services with service providers. Onehub shares information with Onehub’s other third-party service providers that perform Services on our behalf, such as payment processing, web hosting, video encoding, or data storage. Additionally, we may share your information with companies that are conducting marketing and advertising to benefit Onehub. These third party companies may use your contact information for communications and marketing purposes that support our activities. You are under no obligation to respond and the companies are restricted from using your contact information for any other purpose. Onehub will ensure that any service provider with which we share Personal Data agrees to safeguard it in substantially the same manner as Onehub has described in this Privacy Policy and in accordance with all applicable laws.
Onehub may aggregate information collected though the Services and remove identifiers so that the information no longer identifies or can be used to identify an individual ( "Anonymized Information "). Onehub shares Anonymized Information with third parties and does not limit third parties' use of the Anonymized Information because it is no longer Personal Data.
Onehub may share Personal Data if Onehub is involved in a merger, sale, acquisition, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, bankruptcy or other change of ownership or control (in whole or in part). Onehub requires that the shared Personal Data remain subject to the promises made in the then-current Privacy Policy, unless and until you agree to a new privacy terms.
Applicable law may require Onehub to disclose your Personal Data if: (i) reasonably necessary to comply with legal process (such as a court order, subpoena or search warrant) or other legal requirements; (ii) disclosure would mitigate Onehub’s liability in an actual or threatened lawsuit; (iii) necessary to protect legal rights of Onehub, users, customers, business partners or other interested parties; or (iv) necessary for the prevention or detection of crime (subject in each case to applicable law). For residents of the European Economic Area ( "EEA" ), Onehub will disclose Personal Data only when permitted to do so under applicable European and EU Member States’ national data protection laws and regulations.
California Shine the Light Law: California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits users who are California residents to obtain from us once a year, free of charge, a list of third parties to whom we have disclosed personal information (if any) for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and you wish to make such a request, please send an e-mail with "California Privacy Rights" in the subject line to support@onehub.com or write us at: Onehub, 1109 1st Avenue, Suite 406, Seattle, WA 98101.
Children's Privacy
The Services are not directed to or intended for use by minors. Consistent with the requirements of applicable law, if we learn that we have received any information directly from a minor without his or her parent’s verified consent, we will use that information only to respond directly to that child (or his or her parent or legal guardian) to inform the minor that he or she cannot use the Services and subsequently will delete that information.
California Minors: While the Service is not intended for anyone under the age of 18, if you are a California resident who is under age 18 and you are unable to remove publicly-available content that you have submitted to us, you may request removal by contacting us at: support@onehub.com. When requesting removal, you must be specific about the information you want removed and provide us with specific information, such as the URL for each page where the information was entered, so that we can find it. We are not required to remove any content or information that: (1) federal or state law requires us or a third party to maintain; (2) was not posted by you; (3) is anonymized so that you cannot be identified; (4) you don’t follow our instructions for removing or requesting removal; or (5) you received compensation or other consideration for providing the content or information. Removal of your content or information from the Service does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of that content or information from our systems or the systems of our service providers. We are not required to delete the content or information posted by you; our obligations under California law are satisfied so long as we anonymize the content or information or render it invisible to other users and the public.
Security of Personal Data
Onehub takes precautions intended to help protect information that we process but no system or electronic data transmission is completely secure. Any transmission of your Personal Data is at your own risk and we expect that you will use appropriate security measures to protect your Personal Data.
You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account credentials for the Services. Onehub will treat access to the Services through your account credentials as authorized by you. Unauthorized access to password-protected or secure areas is prohibited and may lead to criminal prosecution. We may suspend your use of all or part of the Services without notice if we suspect or detect any breach of security. If you believe that information you provided to us is no longer secure, please notify us immediately using the contact information provided below.
If we become aware of a breach that affects the security of your Personal Data, we will provide you with notice as required by applicable law. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Onehub will provide any such notice that Onehub must provide to you under applicable law at your account’s email address. By using the Services, you agree to accept notice electronically.
All payments received via credit card are processed securely by Braintree, using measures that comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (" PCI DSS ").
Data Retention
We retain Personal Data in identifiable form only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which the Personal Data was provided to Onehub or, if longer, to comply with legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce agreements and similar essential purposes. To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Data, the purposes for which we process your Personal Data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
Accessing and Updating Your Personal Information
You may request access to your personal information or correct an error or omission in your personal information by contacting us at support@onehub.com or write us at: Onehub, 1109 1st Avenue, Suite 406, Seattle, WA 98101. We will make good faith efforts to resolve requests to correct inaccurate information except where the request is unreasonable, requires disproportionate technical effort or expense, jeopardizes the privacy of others, or would be impractical. Residents of the EEA may have additional rights concerning the access and updating of their Personal Data (see the section titled The General Data Protection Regulation).
Privacy Shield
Onehub complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks administered by the US Department of Commerce (together, "Privacy Shield") regarding the processing of Personal Data (as defined below) from European Union member countries and Switzerland. This means that Onehub certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice; Choice; Accountability for Onward Transfer; Security; Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation; Access; and Recourse, Enforcement, and Liability. If you are a resident of the European Economic Area, please see our Privacy Shield Policy for information about our data protection practices for personal data that we receive from European Union member countries and Switzerland pursuant to their respective Privacy Shield frameworks.
For purposes of enforcing compliance with the Privacy Shield, Onehub is subject to the investigatory and enforcement authority of the US Federal Trade Commission. For more information about the Privacy Shield, see the US Department of Commerce's Privacy Shield website located at https://www.privacyshield.gov/.
