Privacy Policy - OnePoll
The Company respects the privacy rights of the Members and Website Users and takes its responsibilities under the Data Protection Act 1998 (the “Act”) seriously. This Privacy Policy explains how we use the information collected about you (including personal data and potentially sensitive personal data as defined in the Act) (“Data”). It also sets out the procedures that we have in place to safeguard your privacy.
This Privacy Policy forms part of the Terms and Conditions therefore by accepting the Terms and Conditions you are consenting to all use of your Data as detailed in this Privacy Policy.
The terms defined in the Terms and Conditions shall have the same meaning when used in this Privacy Policy unless specifically set out below.
Personal Data
Data is stored by us for the primary purpose of providing the Website and collating, analysing and selling the data (in anonymous form) to third parties for research purposes (our “Services”). If you do not agree to us collecting and using your Data in this manner we may be unable to provide the Website and/or accept your registration as a Member. You are advised to read this Privacy Policy carefully so that you are aware of any third parties who may have access to your Data.
Use and Retention of Data
When you register with us to open an Account you shall be required to complete an online registration form. The Data submitted by you via the online registration form and the Data submitted by you in the Surveys may be used by us to provide our Services.
Please be assured that we will never disclose your Data to a third party in such a manner that could lead to identification of you as an individual.
In respect of both Website Users and Members, we may gather further Data from you, for example, if you email comments, request further services or enter a competition or promotion offered by the Company. Furthermore, the Company may have access to details of your Website habits including the dates and number of times you visit the Website and the transactions you carry out through the Website.
In order to provide the Website and Surveys we may enter into contracts with third parties for the provision of the Website, for example, our internet service provider and Website host. In facilitating the Website such third parties may have access to your Data.
In addition to using the Data to provide the Services, Data held by us may also be used for our internal purposes. For example, we may analyse the Data to help us develop and improve the Website and/or Surveys.
We may use your email addresses to send emails to you regarding further information about the Company’s services which we think you might find useful and interesting. Also, we may use your email address to invite you to participate in Surveys or in case studies or to inform you if you are a Prize winner. In every email we send we will provide instructions on how to unsubscribe so that you will not receive any further emails regarding such matters.
In order to enable us to provide you with a personalised browsing experience the Website may use “cookie” information collection technology. We may also use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer the Website and/or to gather broad demographic information.
We may use third party advertising agencies to display banner ads on the Website. Banner ads may contain cookies, and appear to be coming from the Website but in reality they are coming from our third party advertising partners, who are providing advertisements on the Website. As such [if you click on the third party banner] your Data may be accessible to the relevant third party advertising agencies.
The Website contains links to third party websites. Also, in order to access certain parts of the Website, promotions or offers you may have to download software from the third parties. In using third party links and/or downloading software from third parties, you may make your Data accessible to those third parties. Please note that we do not have any control over such websites or downloads. Therefore we cannot be liable for the protection and privacy of any Data which you provide whilst visiting such facilities. For the avoidance of doubt, no third party websites are governed by this Privacy Policy so you should carefully review the privacy policy contained on the relevant website.
The Company may disclose your Data where it is under a duty to disclose or share your Data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply the Terms and Conditions and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property or safety of the Company, our customers or others.
If you wish us to remove your Data please contact the Data Controller at anne@swns.com. We will remove your Data as soon as reasonably practicable.
Aggregate Information
We may use aggregate Data and statistics for the purpose of monitoring the Website usage in order to help us develop the Website and the Surveys.
Data Security
We use system monitoring tools to protect your Data where appropriate.
The internet is not a totally secure medium. However, we have put in place various security procedures as set out in this Privacy Policy. Subject to the provisions of the Terms and Conditions we shall keep your Data confidential. The security procedures of the Company relate to storage, access and disclosure of your Data. If you register to become a Member your identity shall be confirmed by reference to unique information such as a user name and password. The user name and password shall enable you to participate in the Surveys and may allow you to access parts of the Website which are not available to individuals who are not Members. It is your responsibility to keep your user name and password confidential.
We take all reasonable steps to require those parties to whom we transfer Data to comply with the same levels of protection as we do. However, you acknowledge and agree that the Company shall not be responsible for any unauthorised use, distribution, damage or destruction of Data, except to the extent we are required to accept such liability under the Data Protection Act 1998.
Owing to the global nature of the internet infrastructure, the Data you provide may be transferred in transit to countries outside the European economic area, which do not have similar protections in place regarding your Data and its use as set out in this Privacy Policy. However, we have taken reasonable steps to try to improve the security of Data. By submitting your information you consent to these transfers.
Access to Data
You have the right to access Data held about you. Your right of access can be exercised in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998. Any access request may be subject to a fee of £10 to meet the Company’s costs in providing you with details of the information held about you.

If the Company is sold or integrated with another business your Data may be disclosed to our advisers and any prospective purchasers and their advisers and will be passed on to the new owners of the business.
