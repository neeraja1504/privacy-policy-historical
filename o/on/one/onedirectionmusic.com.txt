TRANSMISSION OF YOUR DATA VIA THE INTERNET
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Any transmission is therefore at

Once we have received your data, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.
However, we cannot guarantee that any information you submit to us will be free from unauthorized third party intrusion.
Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site,
you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share the password with anyone.
WHERE YOUR DATA IS KEPT OR TRANSFERRED
The data that we collect may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"),
for instance if any of our servers from time to time are located outside the EEA or if one of our service providers or
suppliers is located in a country outside the EEA or if we share your data (in accordance with the 'With whom we share
your data' section below).
Where any of those destinations are countries that do not have data protection laws as stringent as those to which we are
subject, we will take all steps necessary to ensure that your data is only transferred lawfully out of the EEA, and used in
accordance with this privacy policy.

which data may include demographic data such as the age range and/or geographic location of groups of users. No
personal data (such as names or email addresses) will be identifiable from such statistics.
(d) In special circumstances
We may disclose personal data in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this data is necessary to
identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference (either intentionally or
unintentionally) with the rights or property of those described above in paragraph (a) or (b). We may also disclose your
personal data when we believe in good faith that the law requires us to do so.
