How about Cookies, Web Beacons and other Tracking Technologies?
We use tracking technologies on the Site. This includes Cookies and Web Beacons. Cookies and Web Beacons collect and store Usage Information. A “Cookie” is a small file containing letters, numbers and symbols. A Cookie stores information about the user or records the user’s browsing activity. Your Device’s hard drive stores Cookies. A “Web Beacon” is an electronic image (1x1.gif) located within a certain web page. A Web Beacon allows the Site to record the simple actions of the user opening the page. Cookies, Web Beacons, and other tracking technologies (e.g., HTML5 and Flash local storage, embedded scripts, and e-tags/cache browsers) may be active on the Site. We may use other tracking technologies in connection with the Site.
We may send tracking technologies to your Device when you visit the Site, or other sites where our ads appear. We may send tracking technologies for different purposes, such as:
To allow you to use and access the Site.
To monitor your experience on the Site.
To allow us to improve the Site.
To improve security on the Site.
For identity verification and fraud prevention.
To analyze traffic and transactions on the Site.
Keeping track of your preferences, such as the presentation of content on the Site.
To market our products and services, such as delivering content based on how you interact with the Site.
We may also work with data providers who collect web log data from you. Web log data may include your IP address and information about your browser or operating system. We may place a data provider’s cookie that recognizes your browser and enables you to receive customized ads or content. These cookies contain no personally identifiable information. They may contain or reflect demographic or other data about your interests in a de-identified form. The information in these cookies may link to data you gave us. This may include your name, postal address or email. We may share this data with a data provider in hashed or encrypted form. To opt out of these data provider cookies, please go to the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) website at http://www.aboutads.info/choices.
We also use depersonalized aggregated Usage Information to improve the performance of the Site. This information may be provided to other companies to help us with this. These other companies may include third-party advertisers, analytics providers, and other service providers. This information can’t be used to identify you.
Your browser should allow you to manage tracking technologies. If your browser’s settings are too strict, you may not be able to use all of the features of the Site.
You may enter the Site from a third-party site, such as a search engine or referral site. Those sites may use tracking technologies to track their own site performance. You must review the privacy policy of each third-party site to know what information about you they collect and how they use it.
How about Interactions with Third-Party Services?
The Site may include functions that allow interactions between the Site and a third-party web site or application. The functions may involve the third-party operator providing certain information including Personal Information, to us. For example, if you click on social media icons on the Site (such as for Facebook, Twitter or Instagram), we may have access to your Personal Information you provided on those third-party sites or applications. If so, we will treat it as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy. We may also provide third-party sites’ interfaces or links on the Site so you can send a message from the Site. For example, we may use third parties to facilitate emails, tweets or Facebook postings. These third parties may keep information used or provided in those messages or activities. Their practices are not subject to our Privacy Policy. We may not control or have access to your communications through these third parties. When you use third-party sites or services, you are using their services and not ours. We are not responsible for their practices. You should review the third parties’ privacy policies before using third-party tools on the Site.
How about Advertising?
The Site collects data about your activities online. We may use it to provide advertising tailored to your interests. We may use third parties such as network advertisers and ad exchanges to serve ads across the Internet. We may use third-party analytics service providers to test and provide us and third parties with information about the use of these ads on third-party websites and viewing of ads and of our content. Third parties may offer you a choice about having your information collected for that purpose. This section of the privacy policy provides details and explains how to make that choice.
You may see certain ads on other third-party websites and services on the Internet. This is because we take part in advertising networks administered by third parties. These networks collect information about your online activities across third-party websites such as through the use of the tracking technologies. They use this information to tailor ads to your interests. The information they collect includes information about your visits to the Site, such as the pages you viewed. These third-party tracking technologies may (a) help deliver ads to you that you might be interested in; (b) keep you from seeing the same ads too many times; and (c) understand the usefulness to you of the ads that you receive. You agree that associated technology may access and use your Device. You agree that it may set or change settings on your Device for the associated operations.
This collection and ad targeting happens both on the Site and on third-party websites that take part in the ad network. This helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. For example, third-party service providers, like Google, may show you our ads on the Internet. Third-party vendors, like Google, use tracking technologies to serve ads after a user visits the Site. The tracking technologies say “This person visited this page, so show them ads relating to that page.” You may opt out of Google’s use of cookies by visiting the Google advertising opt-out page https://www.google.com/settings/u/0/ads/authenticated?hl=en. We are not responsible for any third parties’ opt-out options.
Google Analytics Advertising Features.
We use these Google Analytics advertising features:
Remarketing with Google Analytics.
Google Display Network Impression Reporting.
Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting.
Integrated services that need Google Analytics to collect data via advertising cookies and anonymous identifiers.
Service providers may set and access their own tracking technologies on your Device. They may collect or have access to information about you, which may include Personal Information. For example, on the Site, Google will collect, store, and use this information to report on how you use the Site. You can opt out of the Google Analytics Advertising Features through their Ads Settings or any other available means. You can find Google Analytics’ opt outs at: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.
We do not control third parties' collection or use of your information to show you interest-based advertising. These third parties may allow you to choose not to have your information collected or used in this way. You can opt out of getting targeted ads from members of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI"). You may do this by visiting the NAI's website at http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices. You may also be able to opt out of getting third-party behavioral ads. You may do this by visiting the DAA website at http://www.aboutads.info/choices. We are not a member of NAI or DAA.
We are not responsible for any third parties’ opt-out options.
How do we Share Information?
We may share non-Personal Information with third parties. This may include aggregated user statistics. We may share your Device Identifiers with third parties with data related to you and your activities.

In connection with the Program, we may ask you to provide us and/or our third-party service providers with certain information, such as (1) Personal Information (as defined above) and (2) demographic information, such as information about your gender or age ("Demographic Information"). We may collect this information through many forms and in many places in the Program.

Interactions with Third-Party Services. The Program site may include functions that allow certain interactions between the Program site and a third-party web site or application.

For example, after you sign-up for our online account management function needed to enter the Program, you may have a choice to link your Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Foursquare or other account provided by a third-party site, platform or application to your Program account so that you may take part in certain types of Program point-earning activities that we may offer from time to time. If you choose to use this account-connecting function, the third-party site, platform or application may send Personal Information about you to us. We will then treat it as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy, since we are collecting it as a result of your accessing of and interaction on the Program.

We may not control or have access to your communications through these third parties. When you use third-party sites or services, you are using their services and not our services. We are not responsible for their practices. You should review the third-party privacy policies before using such third-party tools on the Program site.

When you use the send-to-a-friend function on the Program site, your contact information, name or user name and message may be included in the communication sent to your addressee(s).
