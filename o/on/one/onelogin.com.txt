Privacy Notice - OneLogin
Last modified March 28, 2019
OneLogin, Inc. (“OneLogin”, “We”, “Us”, or “Our”) is committed to protecting the privacy of your personal information while using our Web site (www.onelogin.com) OneLogin has established this Privacy Policy (“Policy”) to describe how we collect and use your personal data if and when you use our Web site as a “Visitor” or provide information to us in connection with your use of the Service as a “Subscriber”. It also describes your choices regarding use, access and correction of your personal information.
Who We Are
You may contact us under OneLogin Inc., 848 Battery Street, San Francisco, CA 94111.
Our EU representative is: OneLogin Ltd, 2 Sheraton Street, W1F 8BH London.
You may contact our Data Protection Officer at privacy@onelogin.com.
The Information We Process
Information you provide : When a Subscriber registers for the Service, we require a first and last name, company name, email, and phone number. After the initial registration, the Subscriber’s designated Client Administrator can share additional end user information with OneLogin in order to enable those end users to use the Service; however, OneLogin never directly collects any end user information, personal or otherwise, without the explicit direction of the Client Administrator. Subscribers are responsible for providing notice to end users concerning the information they collect and share with OneLogin as part of their use of the Service.
Cookies : When you visit the Web site or use the Service, we use session “cookies” – a piece of information stored on your computer – to allow the Web site or Service to uniquely identify your browser while you are logged in and to enable OneLogin to process your online transactions.Please see the “Use of Cookies” section for further information.
Clear Gifs : We also use third party advertising and tracking tools that employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), to help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the movements of the visitors to our Web site. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our Visitors and Subscribers in order to optimize and enhance the Web site and Service experience. We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.
Log Files : As is true of most Websites, we and our third party utility-tracking partners gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp and clickstream data.
HTML5 : We use Local Storage, such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences. Third Parties, with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity, use local storage objects (HTML5) to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 Local Storage.
Analytics and Remarketing : OneLogin uses remarketing on the Web site with Google Analytics and services like AdRoll to advertise online. Third-party vendors, including Google, show our ads on sites across the Internet. OneLogin and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on your past visits to our website. You may opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads using Google’s Ads Preferences Manager. If you wish to not have your information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking here (or if located in the European Union click here). Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.
If you do not provide the listed personal data to us, we may not be able to provide you with certain features of our Web site.
We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our Mobile Software on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from. OneLogin collects PII in order to provide high level of security by assessing the risk of the user authenticating from the correct user device.
Mobile: When you download and use our Services, we automatically collect information on the type of device you use, the frequent usage, application version, operating system version, the time it been used, and the device identifier (or “UDID”).
How We Process Personal Data
OneLogin uses the personal data including your use of the Service to operate and make the Service available to you, for billing, identification and authentication, to contact you about your use of the Service, research purposes, and to generally improve the content, functionality, and security of the Web site and the Service. OneLogin will also use the collected personal information to send you periodic newsletters to inform you about OneLogin and our services.
The processing is based on our legitimate interests (Art. 6 (1)(f) of the GDPR).
We may use personal data provided as testimonials, which is always based on consent (Art. 6(1)(a) of the GDPR).

Information Related to Data Collected through the Service

We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe. We may transfer personal information to companies that help us provide our service. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our clients.
OneLogin (the data processor) has no direct relationship with the end users that are part of a Service Subscription plan. An end user who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct their request to their designated Client Administrator (the data controller). The Client Administrator can modify your account information at any time within the Service’s Account settings or by contacting our OneLogin Customer Success Team.

We will retain end user information for as long as a Subscription is active, the Client Administrator requests the deletion of the same, or as needed to provide you with services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
Sharing Information With Third Parties
OneLogin uses a third party intermediary to perform credit card processing when registering for the paid Subscription plans of the Service. This intermediary is not permitted to store, retain, or use your billing information except for the sole purpose of credit card processing on OneLogin’s behalf.

Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the provisions in this Policy regarding notice and choice and the service agreements with our Clients.
