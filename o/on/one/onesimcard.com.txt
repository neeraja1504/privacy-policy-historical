OneSimCard - Privacy Policy
We are committed to your privacy in every transaction
At OneSimCard®, the privacy and security of your personal information is extremely important to us. We want to make sure that your personal information is properly protected. We only grant access to personal information about you (such as your name, address, etc.) to our company employees to provide or offer products and services to you, process and service your account(s), and for administration purposes.
We share your personal information with financial service providers to process credit card transactions.
We may, in accordance with the terms of contracts, give other telecommunications companies providing services to Belmont Telecom, Inc, personal information on nonpaying customers, senders of commercial or other unsolicited e-mail (spam), or customers whose service has been suspended due to refusal to respond to requests for identification verification in accordance with Article 11 of the Act for Prevention of Improper Use of Mobile Voice Communications Services.
For the purposes of preventing illegal contracts, the occurrence of nonpayment of charges, and other incidents, we may provide other mobile telecommunications carriers with personal information (name, address, date of birth, identification documents, identification numbers, arrest information, methods of forgery) related to forged or falsified identification documents submitted by customers or persons applying for a contract.
We may provide the necessary personal information, in accordance with the terms of contracts or with prior consent from the customer, to other mobile carriers or PHS carriers involved in the implementation of Mobile and PHS Number Portability (MNP) or telecommunications carriers with whom we have entered into interconnection agreements.
We may provide customer information (such as the location from which a call was placed, name and/or address of the customer), in accordance with the terms of contracts, to organizations that deal with emergencies (such as the Police Agency, Coast Guard Headquarters or the Fire Department).
In the event that a customer files a complaint against OneSimCard regarding SMS received by the customer, we may, with prior consent from the customer, give other telecommunications companies personal information related to such filing. In addition, in the event that a line contractor with a telecommunications carrier other than Belmont Telecom, Inc. who received SMS sent by a customer files a complaint against such telecommunications carrier regarding the SMS sent by the customer, we may, in accordance with the terms of contracts, receive personal information on the customer from such telecommunications carrier.
In addition to the above, we may provide personal information held by Belmont Telecom, Inc to third parties in a form where personal identification cannot be discerned.
We may access, preserve and share your information in response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards.
In order to improve our customers’ product satisfaction we may use 3rd party review/survey management providers for surveys. In this case, your email address may be shared with that provider with the purpose of sending you a survey about your experience with OneSimCard products and services.
