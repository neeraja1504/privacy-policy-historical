To process, fulfill and notify you of your product order status; and
To inform you about the latest information about our Company, updates in policies and procedures, promotions and changes in strategy.
From time to time we collect personal information from our Users. Where permitted by the provisions of applicable laws the Company may use and disclose such personal information about our Users. for the following purposes:

Other purposes directly relating to any of the above.
Additionally, User preferences and settings (time zone, language, privacy preferences, product preferences, etc.) may be collected to enhance the Service.
As is standard practice on many websites, the Company also logs non-personally-identifiable information including IP address, profile information, aggregate User data, and browser type, from Users and other visitors to the site or application. This data is used to improve the Services, to analyze trends, to administer the Services, to track Users’ movements around the Service and to gather demographic information about our User base as a whole. The Company will not use the information collected to market directly to that person. This non-personally-identifiable information may be shared with third parties to provide more relevant services and special offers to Users. User IP addresses are recorded for security and monitoring purposes.
In addition, the Company and third parties may use pixel tags — tiny graphic images — to tell us what parts of our website Users have visited or to measure the effectiveness of searches Users perform on our site, among other data. Pixel tags also enable us to send email messages in formats Users can read. And they tell us whether emails have been opened to assure that we’re only sending messages that are of interest to our Users. The Company stores the information we gather in a database stored on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. To the extent that third parties gather information, they store that information and are responsible for their use of the same.
The Company may also use a User’s email address to send updates, a newsletter or news regarding the service. The Company may send email communications which use a “click-through URL” linked to content on the OneAcademy website. When a User clicks one of these URLs, they pass through our web server before arriving at the destination web page. The Company tracks this click-through data to help determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our Users communications. If you prefer not to be tracked simply avoid clicking text or graphic links in the email.
The Company may also collect information for market research purposes to gain a better understanding of our Users and thus provide more valuable service. The Company also collects information regarding User activities on our website, and on related websites. This helps us to determine how best to provide useful information to Users and to understand which parts of our websites and Internet services are of most interest to them.
