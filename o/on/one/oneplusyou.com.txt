NextC is part of a dating network with other similar services. This includes other companies such as Mingle LTD, Ignite Technology LLC, Innovation Consulting Inc.
We share your information with other partner companies to benefit you in two respects:
For other partner companies to assist us in processing your information, as service providers, upon our instructions and on our behalf.

In order to improve your chances at building significant connections with others, we may make you visible on other partner services or allow you to benefit from cross-platform functionalities. We will of course comply with applicable law and, where relevant, notify you of any such opportunity and allow you to agree or to refuse. Examples of such opportunities may include the creation of a new service within the partner, addressing a specific demographic that we feel would be interesting to you based on your search criteria.
Additionally, we may share information with third parties as follows:

Our partners use this information to recognize you across different channels and platforms over time for advertising, analytics, attribution, and reporting purposes.
