[1] The definition of personal information may vary from country to country. The definition of personal information in this Privacy Policy mainly refers to that in the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR in short), which will be implemented by the European Union on May 25, 2018. If some countries or regions have different definitions on personal information, the laws of these countries or regions shall be applied according to the specific circumstances. To maximize the protection of a user's personal information, we may process some non-personal information using the same protection standards as are used with personal information. If non-personal information is mixed with personal information, we will regard non-personal information as personal information.
[2] OnePlus is a company headquartered in China. When we entrust partners around the world to provide customers with our products and services, we disclose some personal information to our partners. For example, our call center services provider outside China is a US-based company, which has call centers in the Philippines to serve EU and other customers. When we provide users’ personal data to our call center provider, its staff working in the US and Philippines process the users’ personal information at the same time. OnePlus online store has commissioned different partners to operate in different countries and regions. OnePlus is the data controller of all OnePlus online stores. Our partners may change due to commercial needs. Consequently, the target countries of transnational transfer of personal information may also change.
