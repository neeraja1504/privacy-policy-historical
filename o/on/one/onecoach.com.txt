OneCoach Privacy Policy
Privacy Policy
Dec. 2, 2008
OneCoach has established this Privacy Policy to explain how it protects and manages the personal information that it collects from you online.
1. Consent for Collection, Use and Disclosure
Your use of the OneCoach site and/or your registration for OneCoach products and services constitute your consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the OneCoach site.
OneCoach may occasionally update this Privacy Policy. When it does, OneCoach will also revise the "last update" date at the top of this Privacy Policy. OneCoach may make new uses or disclosures of information collected from clients, such as in connection with an investigation of a breach of an agreement, contravention of laws, an emergency where the life, health or security of an individual is threatened, the collection of a debt or in compliance with the request of a law enforcement agency or a court order, and in such circumstances, OneCoach will not inform and obtain the consent of the client prior to such change.
A client may withdraw his or her consent for collection, use and disclosure at any time by sending an email to unsubscribe. Please note that, if you do, OneCoach may suspend its provision of products and services to you.
2. Accountability
OneCoach collects, at the time of your registration and your sign-on to its web site, certain personal information (information that personally identifies you) which may include, but is not limited to, your name, email address, home or work address, telephone number, and information about your computer hardware and software (e.g., IP address, operating system, browser type, domain name, URL, access times, and referring web site addresses).
OneCoach has implemented this Privacy Policy to protect personal information received from its clients, and to respond to any inquiries. The Privacy Policy also provides that OneCoach will use appropriate contractual means to establish a comparable level of protection for personal information which is sent for processing by third parties on OneCoach's behalf.
OneCoach has designated responsibility for your personal information to its Privacy Officer who ensures compliance with the principles in this Privacy Policy. Other OneCoach individuals may be delegated to act on behalf of the Privacy Officer.

as necessary if OneCoach has reason to believe that disclosure is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference (either intentionally or unintentionally) with OneCoach's rights or property, other users of OneCoach's web site, products or services, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities; and
to respond to judicial process and provide information to law enforcement agencies or in connection with an investigation on matters related to public safety, as permitted by law, or otherwise as required by law.
