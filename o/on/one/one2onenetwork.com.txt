We also collect aggregate information, which is non-personally identifiable/anonymous information, such as frequency of visits to the Site, Site pages most frequently accessed, IP address, browser type , marital status and household income. Aggregate Information is used in a collective manner, and no single person can be identified by that compiled information.

Phishing.
Identity theft and the practice currently known as “phishing” are of great concern to One2One. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We do not request your credit card information, login information, or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication. For more information about phishing, visit the Federal Trade Commission’s website.
Breach Notification.
We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of stored “personal data” (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you via email or conspicuous posting on this Network in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as it is consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.
International Transfer.
Your information may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, One2One transfers Personal Information to the United States and processes it there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.
Business Transfers
In the event that we sell substantially all of our assets, or one of our business units are acquired, Personally Identifiable information of Network Members along with aggregate information collected on the Site will likely be one of the transferred assets.
