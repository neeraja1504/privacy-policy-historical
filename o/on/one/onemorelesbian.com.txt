In general, cookies can make the Internet more useful by storing information about your preferences on a particular system. Unfortunately, viewers who turn off cookies in their browser settings will not be able to use or view content on our Site.

A) We may share aggregate or summary information regarding our viewers with partners, advertisers or other third parties. This data will never identify you personally.
B) We may share information with companies that provide support services to us (such as web hosting) or that help us market our business and services.

PROTECTING YOUR INFORMATION
While We will take reasonable precautions to protect the security and integrity of your personal information provided to our Site, due to the inherent nature of the Internet as an open global communications vehicle, We cannot guarantee that information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our system or otherwise in our care, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers.  Unfortunately, no security system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information and cannot assume liability for improper access to it. With that in mind, We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your personal information.
For example:
We use industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (“SSL”) authentication for online transactions made on our Site. SSL authentication and encryption of the information that you send to Us over the Internet helps protect your online transaction information from third party interception.
Your credit card information is never used except charges for orders placed on our Site.  For your own safety, please don’t ever use email to send us your credit card information!
We never display your full credit card number once it has been entered. We will only reveal the last four digits of your credit card for verification purposes.
For additional security, we do not store your credit card number after processing your payment.
While we do our best to protect your privacy, we urge you to also protect your own privacy. We recommend that you do not share your password with anyone or share your password in an unsolicited phone call or e-mail.
In addition, while using our services, you will have the opportunity to post reviews or other personal information in the public forums available on our Site. When you post such information, it is made public and therefore such disclosure is not subject to this privacy policy. You hereby agree and understand that One More Lesbian is not responsible for any third party’s use of any personal information you publicly disclose through our services on our Site.
