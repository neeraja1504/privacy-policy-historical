Privacy policy
Customer privacy is very important to us, and we’d like to outline in this document how any personal data collected from you via www.onepiece.com or in one of our global stores, will be protected, stored and used by us to communicate with you.
We collect, use and store your basic personal details to process and send your orders to the correct person and location. We also collect it to keep you in the know about our latest products, special offers and sales. The more personal information we have about you, the more tailored we can make your email newsletters, best suited to your interests and style.
Yes, it is very safe to leave your personal details with us. We use market-leading technology and software to ensure your personal data is secure. If we work with any third party services, we always ensure they have the correct, industry standard security measures to access our database.
