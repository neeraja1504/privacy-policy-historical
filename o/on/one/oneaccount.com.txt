Our privacy policy
If you're going to run all your finances through the One account , you need to be 100% sure that your information is in safe hands. That's why we want to be clear and open about how we store and use your data. And there's no question who's in control of any information we hold, that's you.
Key points to remember:
We'll only collect the information we need to provide you with the best possible service.
We will never sell, rent or trade information about you to other companies.
Your information will always be kept safe and secure. It will never fall into the wrong hands. You can request to see it whenever you want.
If you ever want us to delete some or all of the information, we will. There's no red tape.
We follow the letter of the UK Data Protection Act 1998.
