Privacy Policy
One Legal is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy sets out how we collect, store, process, transfer, share, and use data that identifies or is associated with you (“personal information”) and information regarding our use of cookies and similar technologies.
1. Personal information we collect about you and how we use it
1.1. Information you give to use: We collect personal information about you when you voluntarily submit information directly to us by filling in forms on our website or by corresponding with us by phone, email, or otherwise. This includes information you provide when you register to use our website, subscribe to the One Legal service, enter a competition, promotion or survey and when you report a problem with our website, or use some other feature of the One Legal service as available from time to time. The table at Annex 1 sets out the categories of personal information you provide to us.
1.2. Information we receive from other sources: We may receive personal information about you if you use any of the other websites we operate or the other services we provide from time to time. We also work closely with third parties (including, for example, subcontractors in technical, payment and delivery services, advertising networks, analytics providers, search information providers, credit reference agencies) and may receive information about you from them, subject to your agreements with them.
1.3. We also automatically collect personal information about you indirectly about how you access and use the One Legal service and information about the device you use to access the One Legal service. This information includes device ID or unique identifier; device type, geolocation info; computer and connection information. We also collect personal information using cookies, web beacons and similar technologies about the pages you view, the links you click, and other actions you take on our services, within our advertising or e-mail content. The table at Annex 2 sets out the categories of personal information we collect automatically.
1.4. We may supplement the personal information we collect with information from third parties and add it to your account information. For example, we may collect and use demographic information that is publicly available, additional contact information, credit check information, and information from credit bureaus, as allowed by applicable national laws
1.5. We may link or combine the personal information we collect and/or receive about you and the information we collect automatically. This allows us to provide you with a personalized experience regardless of how you interact with us.
1.6. We may anonymize and aggregate any of the personal information we collect (so that you are not personally identified). We may use anonymized information for purposes that include testing our IT systems, research, data analysis, improving the One Legal service and developing new products and features. We may also share such anonymized information with others.
2. Disclosure of your personal information
2.1. We have never shared your personal information with third parties, and have no plans to do so, except:
2.1.1. If your request it;
2.1.2. to complete a transaction initiated by you (which may sometimes include disclosure to a credit card bureau); or
2.1.3. if we are required or allowed by the law, such as to respond to a subpoena or to investigate fraudulent activity.
2.2. To further protect your confidentiality, we require any organizations to which we provide data to have similar privacy safeguards and contractually only allow them to use our customers’ information for the intended service. You do not have to ask for this confidentiality, it is our standard practice.
2.3. If, in the future, we ever decide that it would be in your interest to share your personal information for any other purpose, you will be informed in advance, and given the opportunity to opt out.
2.4. Publicly accessible blogs. Our website includes publicly accessible blogs or community forums. Any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected and used by others who access them. This includes information posted on our public social media accounts. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at privacy@onelegal.com.

4.1. Security. All information you provide to us is stored on secure servers in a controlled environment with limited access. Any payment transactions will be encrypted in transit using SSL technology. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our service, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. Subscribers should not share their password with anyone.
4.2. While no transmission of information via the internet is completely secure, we take reasonable measures to protect your personal information. We cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to our website; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access.
4.3. International transfers of your personal information. The personal information we collect may be transferred to and stored in countries outside of the jurisdiction you are in where we and our third-party service providers have operations. If you are located in the European Union (“EU”), your personal information will be processed outside of the EU including in the United States; these international transfers of your personal information are made pursuant to appropriate safeguards, such as standard data protection clauses adopted by the European Commission. If you wish to enquire further about these safeguards used, please contact us using the details set out at the end of this privacy policy.
5. Retaining your information
5.1. We will only retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of our legitimate business interests and satisfying any legal or reporting requirements. In addition, we may retain personal information from closed accounts to comply with national laws, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigation, enforce our User Agreement and take other actions permitted or required by applicable national laws. After it is no longer necessary for us to retain your personal information, we dispose of it in a secure manner according to our data retention and deletion policies.
5.2. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and the applicable legal requirements.
