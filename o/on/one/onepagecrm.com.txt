Security Measures
Acknowledgement and Disclaimer
We take our security responsibilities seriously, using the most appropriate physical and technical measures and require our hosting partner to use the same standard of care. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will always do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our Site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access. These are described in more detail below.
Location of Servers and Accessibility
The Services are a SaaS based CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system and, as such, your personal data is not stored locally but on a secure server. No installs are required on your PC or laptop. Our web application is only accessible via HTTPS, which helps ensure your interactions with our app are secure and private.
Data Storage
Your personal data is stored on secure servers hosted on Amazon Web Services, a service provided by Amazon.com. These servers are located in the USA. Amazon Web Services participates in and has certified its compliance with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework. You can read more about Amazon’s security policy on AWS Cloud Security.

Your personal data is backed up on a nightly basis. The Amazon server data centres are protected by physical barriers and guarded 24/7.
Data Encryption
Data is encrypted using SSL Certification when transmitted from our servers to your browser. In the "security test" page we are graded A+. In addition to this, the connection from us to the server is secured using a 256 BIT ENCRYPTION key.
Restricted Access
Our servers in Amazon's data centre are run in an isolated private network (Amazon Virtual Private Cloud Service). Access to the production environment where your personal data is stored is limited and is held by us. Only our authorized staff from the have access to our servers and this is on a 'need to access' basis. Access to personal data is limited to specific IP address.
Development and Operations
New features and updates are developed and released on development servers prior to being pushed live to the main production environment. Extensive testing is undertaken by our Quality Team to ensure all new features are working correctly and the performance of the Site and Services is maintained.
Performance Monitoring Applications
The overall performance of the Site and Services is very important. NewRelic is a performance management solution used for tracking and monitoring the Site and Services. We also use Fabric and Pingdom to analyze the Site’s and Services’ performance. To help avoid or minimize service interruptions, our servers are constantly monitored and a dedicated team are alerted immediately in case of any service disruptions.
Passwords and Authentication
Connection to the Services environment is via TLS cryptographic protocols, using global step-up certificates, ensuring that our users have a secure connection from their browsers to our service. Individual user sessions are identified verified using a unique token created at login. Email address is the unique identifier in the Services. If a user inputs their password incorrectly then a Captcha test is shown to verify that it is being inputted by a human and not spammers or bots.
Your Personal Data and Your Rights
Accessing your Personal Data
You may request access at any time to a copy of the personal data we hold about you. Any such request should be submitted to us in writing and sent to support@onepagecrm.com We will need to verify your identity in such circumstances and may request more information or clarifications from you if needed to help us locate and provide you with the personal data requested. There is usually no charge applied to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive, we may charge a reasonable fee. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
Right of Restriction
You may restrict us from processing your personal data in any of the following circumstances:
You have contested the accuracy of the personal data we hold on record in relation to you or for a period of time to enable us to verify the accuracy of the personal data;
The processing of your personal data is unlawful and you request the restriction of the use of personal data instead of its erasure;
We no longer require your personal data for the purpose of processing but you require this data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; or
Where you have contested the processing (under Article 21(1) of the GDPR) pending the verification of our legitimate grounds.
Corrections or Erasure (Right to Rectification and Right to Be Forgotten)
If we hold personal data concerning you which are no longer necessary for the purposes for which they were collected or if you withdraw consent for us to process your personal data, you can request the deletion of this personal data. This right, however, will not apply where we are required to process personal data in order to comply with a legal obligation or where the processing of this information is carried out for reasons of public interest in the area of public health. If the personal information we hold about you is inaccurate, you may request to have your personal information updated and corrected. To do so at any time, please contact us by email at support@onepagecrm.com
Your Right to Object
You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data at any time:
For direct marketing purposes
For profiling to the extent it relates to direct marketing
Where we process your personal data for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by us, except where we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for this processing which would override your interests, rights, and freedoms or in connection with the enforcement or defence of a legal claim
To exercise your right to object at any time, please email support@onepagecrm.com. Should this occur, we will no longer process your personal data for these purposes unless doing so is justified by a compelling legitimate ground as described above. For more information about our marketing practices, please see the Marketing Communications section below.
Data Portability
Where we process your personal data by automated means (i.e., not on paper) and this processing is based on your consent or required for the performance of a contract between us, you have the right to request from us a copy of your personal data in a structured, commonly used machine-readable format and, where technically feasible, to request that we transmit your personal data in this format to another controller.
Profiling
Profiling is an automated form of processing of personal data often used to analyze or predict personal aspects about an individual person. This could relate to a person’s performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, reliability, behavior, location or movements. An example of this would be where a bank uses an automated credit scoring system to assess and reject a loan application.
You have the right to be informed if your personal data will be subject to automated decision making, including profiling. You also have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated process, including profiling, where that decision impacts on your legal rights. There are some exceptions to this rule, where, for example, the decision is necessary in connection with the performance of a contract between us, is authorized by law or where you have given your explicit consent to this automated processing. In this case, however, we do not engage in profiling or automated processing for profiling purposes.
Personal Rights
The rights described in this section are personal rights and are exercisable only by the individual person (or data subject) concerned. If we receive any such request or communication directly from your customers and/or in relation to Your End Customer Data, we will refer the matter to you and cooperate in providing such reasonable assistance as may be required to enable you, as a controller, to respond to the matter. This will be described in more detailed in the Terms of Service or the other relevant contract between us.
Marketing Communications
We will not use your data to send marketing communications to you about promotions, competitions, updates and new products or services that may be of interest to you, unless we have your permission to do so.
Your Right to Object
You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data for our marketing purposes. To object or if you change your mind at any later time, you can withdraw your consent to the processing of your personal data for such marketing purposes by contacting us at support@onepagecrm.com You may also opt out of receiving marketing communications at any time by selecting the unsubscribe option when you receive an electronic marketing communication from us. The withdrawal of your consent will not impact upon the lawfulness of processing based on your consent prior to the withdrawal.
We use MailChimp and other email marketing service providers
Some of our communications may be sent by email using MailChimp. Mailchimp’s servers and offices are located in the USA so if you choose to receive marketing communications from us by email, this means that your personal data may be transferred to, stored, or processed in the USA and you consent to the transfer, storing and processing of your personal data in this way. MailChimp participates in and has certified its compliance with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework. A copy of Mailchimp’s privacy policy is published at MailChimp’s Legal Policies.
Third Party Material
We always endeavor to deal with vendors and other third parties who are GDPR compliant or, in the case of the third parties located outside of the EEA, who are certified as compliant with the EU-US Privacy Shield, as applicable, or who have adequate security measures in place to safeguard the security of personal data. That said, we, our employees, agents, holding company and subsidiaries, accepts no liability howsoever arising for the content or reliability of any third party materials or websites referenced by hyperlink or other means on the Site or for the data collection and use practices or security measures used by such third parties. If you submit personal data to any of those sites, your personal data is governed by their privacy policy. We encourage you to carefully read their privacy policies.
