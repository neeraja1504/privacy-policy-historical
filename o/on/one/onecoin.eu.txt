We at Onecoin do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our Members’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment, in a locked facility.
If visitors have any questions about the security on www.Onecoin.eu, feel free to contact the customer service.
To prevent unauthorized access, disclosure and improper use of your information, we have established appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial safeguards to protect the information we collect in accordance with our privacy policy.

They enable Onecoin to estimate its audience size and usage pattern, to store information about customer preferences, such as wagering patterns, and to recognise Account Holders when they return to the Website.
An Account Holder may refuse to accept cookies by activating a setting on the browser which allows one to refuse the setting of cookies. Activating such setting however may mean that the Account Holder may be unable to access certain parts of the Website.
