We may release account and other personal information when we believe it necessary to comply with the law, enforce or apply our Terms of Service, or protect the rights, property, or safety of ONBILE, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
In the event of a business transfer or sale by ONBILE, client information is generally one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the conditions of any pre-existing Privacy Policy (unless, of course, you consent for their use otherwise).

Log Files
As it happens with most websites, we collect certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.
We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
This information may also be used to identify users who are using the service for spam or other activity that may conflict with our Terms of Service. This information will be used as a whole, and never linked back to any personal identification information.
Cookies
Like most websites, we use small bits of data called cookies, stored on users' computers to simulate a continuous connection. Cookies let us 'remember' information about your preferences and passwords and allow you to move within our Service without reintroducing yourself. Users who disable cookies will not be able to use the Service, as they are required to maintain their login information to our service during a browser session.
Disabling cookies does not prevent you from accessing websites published under our system, although some features of those sites may be degraded.
These cookies can be tied back to personally identifiable information only in the event that you are logged into our Service. If you are logged in to our Service, the cookies on your computer will only identify your account within our system.
This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by ONBILE only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. See the 'Third Party Advertisers' section for more details.
Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our site. We have no access to, or control over, these cookies. See Third Party Advertisers.
