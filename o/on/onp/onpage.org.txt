Ryte: Privacy - usage of cookies, personal data and more
Please note: The German Privacy Policy is binding.
Data Protection Declaration
We are pleased that you are visiting our website and show an interest in our company. We take the protection of your personal data seriously and want to ensure that you feel secure and enjoy visiting our internet pages.
1. General
You agree to the German Privacy Policy which has been translated to English for your convenience only. The German Privacy Policy is binding.
Ryte GmbH places the highest significance on the protection of the privacy of its users. This applies particularly to the processing of personal data. You don’t have to reveal personal data when using our website. In certain cases we do, however, need your name and address as well as further data in order to process your order. Where this is needed we will point this out to you as appropriate. In addition, we will only store and process data which you have voluntarily or automatically provided us with.
2. Acquisition and Processing
Every access to our website and all calling up of underlying data are recorded. These include: the data names of called-up data and the date and time of the call, the volume of data transmitted, notification of successful call-ups and the web browser and domain of the enquirer. This recording is for internal statistical reasons. The IP addresses of the computers from which the requests were issued are also recorded. Going forward, personal data will only be stored if you have given it freely in connection with a question, an order or registration.
3. Usage and Transmission
We will handle the personal data you revealed confidentially and only reveal it to third parties if required by order processing, for example by passing order data to deliverers. In no case would we sell or rent your personal data or data that could be linked to you to third parties for them to use. Personal data will only be used to process your orders, to answer your questions and for internal compilation of anonymized statistics. The only exceptions will consist of services ordered by you which will include your consent to the further use of data you provided and by the relaying of data to public institutions and authorities as required by law. We will, with your agreement, pass your compiled and stored data to our business partners under the aegis of contractual agreements, insofar as it is necessary in your interests. Of course, our business partners are called upon and obliged to comply with legal data protection regulations.
We will identify any advertising for other organizations on our Internet site insofar as we advertise them. According to the court decision of 12th May 1998, “Liability for Links” (312 O 85/98), the Hamburg district court clearly decided that an organization, by installing a link, becomes jointly responsible for, which means liable for, the contents of the linked site; this can only be prevented if the linking organization clearly distances itself from these contents which Ryte GmbH hereby does.
Ryte GmbH will not transmit data to non-EU states without your agreement except where it is necessary for transaction processing and is explicitly allowed by the BDSG.

Stored personal data will be deleted if the website user and/or customer cancels their permission for it to be stored or if their knowledge is no longer necessary for the fulfilment of whatever purpose caused them to be stored or if their storage becomes impermissible for other legal reasons. Data needed for calculation of invoices or for book-keeping reasons are unaffected by this.

The transfer of your IP address for the purposes of Google Analytics won’t be merged with other Google data.
You can prevent your browser software from storing cookies with a respective change of settings; we however point to the fact that in this case you may not be able to use all features of this website to its full extent.

If you are logged into Google+, Google can directly correlate your visit of our website with your Google+ profile.

Rather, the cookies serve a cross website placement of advertisements by enabling Google to identify the pages visited. The information generated by the cookies is transmitted by Google to a server in the USA for analysis and stored there. A transfer of data by Google to third parties only takes place due to legal regulations or within the scope of order data processing.
