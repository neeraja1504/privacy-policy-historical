WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION ONTRACK PASSIVELY COLLECTS: COOKIES AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES
Ontrack’s web site, online services, applications, email messages, and advertisements, if any, may use “cookies” and other technologies such as pixel tags and web beacons ( pixel tags and web beacons are together known as “Other Technologies”) to collect information about you. A cookie is a small data file stored on the web browser on your computer’s hard drive. A cookie associates the identification numbers built into the cookie with information about you that you have provided to us. This association allows us to recognize who you are when you arrive at our web site. Other Technologies tell us where on our website you have visited, counts how many users visited certain web pages within our web site, and measures the effectiveness of advertisements, if any, and web searches.
Like most web sites, we also automatically collect some tracking information and store that tracking information in an anonymous, aggregated and non-personal format. This tracking information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language, Internet Service Provider (ISP), operating system used, date and time stamps and click stream data. We use this tracking information to understand and analyze trends, to administer our web site, and to learn about user behavior on our web site. However, Ontrack may use IP addresses to identify you when Ontrack feels, in its sole discretion, that it is necessary to enforce compliance with its TOU, this Privacy Policy, to protect its services, Web Site, systems, information, employees, business partners, affiliates, users, customers or others, or when required by law.

Affiliates: Ontrack may share any or all of your Personal Information with and among its affiliated or related entities, including Ontrack affiliates located in the EU and elsewhere.
