7. Children's personal information
"Minors" are individuals under the age of 13. We do not use Minors' data for targeted marketing and/or advertisements, or rent or sell it to anyone.

OnMyCalendar relies on the Account Owner (e.g. school, teacher, coach) to obtain verifiable parental consent to provide our services to minors.
