OnionLink: Privacy Policy
TL/DR : At its core, OnionLink trades privacy for convenience. Although we collect vastly less information than websites like Google, Facebook, or Twitter, we do keep logs. We make good faith effort to reduce third parties' exposure personally identifying information in these logs, but we also have advertisers who almost assuredly do not make such an effort. For real privacy, download and use the Tor Browser Bundle.
This Privacy Policy applies to https://onion.link (hereinafter, "us", "we", or "OnionLink"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting logged personally identifiable information we incur through your use of the site. We have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information is collected, how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect through the website and does not apply to information collected by other sources (e.g., email).
This Privacy Policy sets forth the general rules and policies governing our use of your data.
