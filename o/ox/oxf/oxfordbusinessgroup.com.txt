Finally, we use data to verify or enforce compliance with the policies governing our website and applicable laws, or to protect against the misuse or unauthorised use of our website.

We also use customer purchase data for research purposes as part of our measures for improving our product and service offering.
We review our retention periods for personal information regularly. If in our audits, we find that your data no longer satisfies the conditions mentioned above, we remove them from our active database.
Transferring of personal data overseas
Your personal information may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (“EEA“) and may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us, or for one of our service providers.
When we, or our permitted third parties, transfer your information outside the European Economic Area, we or they will impose contractual obligations on the recipients of that data to protect your information to the standard required in the European Economic Area.
