Privacy Policy
At Occidental Petroleum Corporation, we recognize and respect your privacy. Therefore, we provide this Privacy Statement to inform you of our policy toward collecting and utilizing information from our users. Please read the Privacy Statement carefully. Occidental may update the Privacy Statement from time to time, so please check this site regularly. The Privacy Statement applies only to sites owned by Occidental but not to any third party sites that may be linked to an Occidental site. Please check those sites for the applicable privacy policy.
As you visit an Occidental site, certain recognition data files may be attached to your hard drive. These files are called "cookies" and are used by Occidental to customize your visit to the site. Cookies can be erased or blocked from your computer through your web browser. Occidental may also collect domain names and gather information such as number of visits, the pages visited, and the average time spent on each page to track traffic patterns throughout the site. This information allows Occidental to improve the overall content of the site and increase user satisfaction.
At points throughout the site, Occidental allows its users to submit personal information in order to request data on Occidental or to sign up for mailing lists. This personally identifiable information includes first and last name, street address, email address, telephone number, fax number and company name. Other points on the website allow for direct order of products and ask for a user identification code and password that may require additional personally identifiable information such as your mother's maiden name and social security number. Occidental uses your personal information only for the purpose for which you provide it. Occidental does not sell or otherwise distribute personally identifiable information from its consumers to third parties.
Users who wish to review the personally identifiable information submitted on the Occidental site can do so by contacting Occidental.
At your request, Occidental will remove or modify any information submitted by you, as appropriate, from its database. If you wish to opt out, please contact us.
As mentioned above, Occidental does not sell or share personally identifiable information from its users to third parties.
