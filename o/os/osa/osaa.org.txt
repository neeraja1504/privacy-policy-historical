OSAA - Privacy Policy
The OSAA recognizes that the growth of on-line services, including Internet services, has created additional privacy concerns, particularly for our constituents. On-line privacy concerns focus on the protection of "person identifiable" information, which an individual reasonably expects to be kept private. As the term suggests, "person identifiable" information is information which can be associated with a specific individual or entity, including, for example, a person's name, address or telephone number, e-mail address, and information about on-line activities that are directly linked to them.
The OSAA knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. This notice describes our privacy policy for the OSAA website.

However, individuals' contact information is intended for the use of OSAA Staff only and is not disclosed to third-parties without permission from the individual user.
Security
The OSAA is fully committed to data security. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure your information. The security of your information is protected during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts transmitted information. In addition to built in SSL security protocols, more sensitive information, like user passwords, are encrypted with a custom written algorithm that cannot be decrypted. We will continue to enhance our security procedures as new technology becomes available.
We urge you to take every precaution to protect your personal data. It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your access codes and to your computer. Do not share your access codes with others. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.
