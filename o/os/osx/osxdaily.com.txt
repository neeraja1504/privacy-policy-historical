What personal data we collect, and why we collect it
The information we collect is used for internal review, and is used to improve the content of our Web page, used to customize the content and/or layout of our page for each individual visitor.
For each visitor to our website, our web hosting server, and content management software (WordPress) automatically attempts to recognize the consumer’s domain name or IP address. This information is used to analyze website usage, as well as to troubleshoot issues with the website, and to detect and manage hacking/spam/abuse.
Separately, we partner with third parties to serve advertising and to offer analytical usage data. Additional details on those matters can be found below.
Comments, spam and abuse management, and comment policy
Leaving comments on the website is entirely optional. Comments that are posted to the site become visible to the public (unless flagged by moderation, spam, or abuse filters), and remain public indefinitely.
When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam and abuse detection. Most spam and abuse detection is handled by Akismet automatically, while some spam and abuse detection is handled manually by the administrators of the website. You can read the Akismet service privacy policy here: https://automattic.com/privacy/
Abusive, spammy, and/or off-topic comments may be deleted, moderated, and any comments containing certain derogatory, inflammatory, offensive, inappropriate, or spammy words or links are automatically flagged and may be deleted or moderated as deemed appropriate by website administrators and/or moderators. Repeated attempts at spam, abusive, or unhelpful comments may be blocked by whatever means can be used to detect and prevent such abuse.
Any and all comments submitted to the web site may be filtered, edited, or modified as deemed necessary to be appropriate for the service. Discussion is encouraged, but any inflammatory, offensive, inappropriate, promotional, or nonsensical comments may be removed or modified as necessary and as deemed appropriate.
Email Newsletter
You may choose to opt-in to receive an email newsletter, which consists of an email containing updates and/or information related to the website content and/or relevant material.
Subscribing to the email newsletter is entirely optional and requires a double opt-in, meaning you enter your email address to subscribe to the newsletter, then you must manually confirm your email subscription by clicking an approval link within an email that is sent to the email address you provided. Only then will you receive an email newsletter from us.
Currently we use Feedburner to send automated email newsletters to subscribers. Feedburner, operated by Google, therefore has access to the email subscribers list, which is where it is controlled and operated. The newsletter service is automated, when you sign up and confirm your subscription, you will get a daily newsletter of whatever was posted that day to the website – that’s it.
To subscribe to the email newsletter for osxdaily.com , you can visit http://feedburner.google.com/fb/a/mailverify?uri=osxdaily&loc=en_US
To unsubscribe from the email newsletter for osxdaily.com, you can simply click the “Unsubscribe” link at the bottom of any email newsletter subscription, in which case you will be instantly unsubscribed from receiving further emails from the newsletter.
To change an email address from one address to another with the newsletter subscription , you must unsubscribe the old email address first, and then re-subscribe and opt-in again with the new email address. We can not manually change emails enrolled in the newsletter, this is an anti-spam prevention mechanism.
Feedburner is a service of Google, you can review Google privacy policy here: https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en&gl=us
Contact forms
Using the contact form to reach out to site administrators is optional. If you fill out the contact form and submit it, that message and data gets transferred to us by email.
If you use a contact form on the website to contact the website administrators and/or website staff, your IP address and other user-provided information, including name and/or email address, and the content of your communication, may be collected in this process. This information is gathered to prevent spam and abuse, as well as to respond to users using the contact form.
Contact form submissions and information is relayed through WordPress and then emailed to us automatically where it is processed and managed by Google Gmail service.
Note that the contact form does not allow for subscriptions of the newsletter, and we will not subscribe you to the newsletter by using the form. A newsletter subscription must be handled by you directly by opting-in and then confirming your subscriptions, see the “Newsletter” section of this privacy policy for more details.

Media, images, etc
If you upload images to the website, or you submit images or information to this website by email or otherwise, you should avoid uploading images with embedded location data (EXIF GPS and other metadata) included. Visitors to the website can download and extract any location data from images on the website if such data exists, which is why it is recommended to remove beforehand.
How long we retain your data, and your data rights
If you leave a comment on the website, which is entirely optional, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve or deny any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue. Some of this is handled automatically by Akismet as outlined further above, and some may be moderated directly.
For users that register on our website (if any, usually only authors and administrators), we also store the personal information they provide in their user profile. All such registered users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username) by logging into the WordPress site with your given login information and modifying it as you see fit. Website administrators can also see and edit that information.
If you have an account on this site because you are an author or an administrator, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. Typically this would be your author name and author email address, which you would be otherwise using to login to access the website.
If you have have left comments that were approved on the website, you can view your approved comments at any time by visiting the location in which you left the respective comment(s). If you decide that you do not want these comments to be visible any longer, or you want your name removed from the comment, you can contact us to request the removal of your provided name and/or email address from the comment, and when possible we will do so. To make such a request, please provide us with information relating to the comment in question, including a precise link to the comment, the name associated with the comment, the email address associated with the comment, and proof that the comment is in fact your comment – this is necessary because you have no rights to request the modification or removal of another persons comments, but only your own. You can also request that we erase any personal data we may hold about you through your comments left on the site, following the same protocol. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes, nor does it include any data that we do not have access to or control over. Keep in mind that visitor comments may be checked through an automated spam detection and abuse detection services and then flagged, deleted, or removed automatically by those spam or abuse detection systems, in which case it is impossible to locate or modify such comments because typically abusive or spammy comments are automatically removed by those detection systems. EU and EEA readers can also request their comments data removal or export in compliance with European rules, when applicable and when possible. Such requests can be made to osxdailycom@gmail.com with the subject “EU DATA REQUEST – COMMENTS”, and should provide an email address or IP address to search for. Note that if a comment was deleted, moderated, or automatically flagged by spam or abuse mechanisms, such data requests would be impossible because the comment data would no longer exist.
