INTRODUCTION
This privacy policy discloses the privacy practices for Geigle Safety Group (geiglesafety.com) and our family of divisions, OSHAcademy (oshatrain.org) and Quality Safety Training (qualitysafetytraining.com). This privacy policy applies solely to information collected by these web sites. This policy will notify you of the following:

What choices are available to you regarding the use of your data.
The security procedures in place to protect the misuse of your information.
How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.
INFORMATION COLLECTION, USE, AND SHARING
We are the sole owners of the information collected on this site. We only have access to information that you voluntarily give us via email or other direct contact from you.
We will not sell or rent this information to anyone.
We will use your information to respond to you, regarding the reason you contacted us. We will not share your information with any third party outside of our organization, other than as necessary to fulfill your request, e.g. to ship an order, submit transcripts, or inform your employer of your training status.
YOUR ACCESS TO AND CONTROL OF YOUR INFORMATION
You may opt out of any future contacts from us at any time.
You can do the following at any time by contacting us via the email address or phone number given on our website:
See what data we have about you, if any.
Change/correct any data we have about you.
We do require verification before making a formal name change. This helps ensure the documents produced by our websites are accurate.
Request us to delete any inaccurate information we have about you.
Request a release of your student transcript to a university or employer
Express any concern you have about our use of your data.
SECURITY
We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline.
Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as transaction data), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web browser, or looking for "https" at the beginning of the web page address.
We do not collect or store any credit card data locally on our computer systems or in paper form. All credit card data collected over the phone is stored in an encrypted form by our credit card processor.
While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.
REGISTRATION
In order to use some functions of our website, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration, a user is required to give certain information (such as name and email address). This information is used to contact you about the products/services on our site in which you have expressed interest. We also require address information for shipping and to help confirm your identity when you contact us.
ORDERS
We request information from you on our order form. To buy from us, you must provide contact information, such as name and shipping address. You will also be asked for financial information, such as credit card number, expiration date. This information is used for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we'll use this information to contact you.
We use an outside shipping company to ship orders. We also use a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes beyond filling your order.
