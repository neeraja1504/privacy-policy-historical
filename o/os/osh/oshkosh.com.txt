Personally Identifiable Information
We may collect personally identifiable information from you, such as your name, email address, physical address, phone number, credit card number, gender, birthday, your children’s names, and your children’s gender when you order products through one of our websites or by phone; purchase our products in our stores; save your information with us online; sign up to receive promotional materials over email or in the mail; or participate in a contest, promotion or survey. Some of the personally identifiable information we collect from you, such as your name, address, phone number, email address, and credit card information, is required in order to process your online order, respond to your requests, and contact you about your order, if necessary. Other information we may request is optional information, which you may choose not to provide, but which helps us make relevant suggestions and offers to you based on your shopping history, children’s ages, etc.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information
We also collect non-personally identifiable information that enables us to enhance your shopping experience by tailoring information to fit your personal taste and interests, such as the information about your product interests and purchases. Examples of non-personally identifiable information include the date and time of your visit, the originating IP address, the pages and images requested, and your purchases.
Cookies
Like most websites, we may place cookies on your computer to collect information about how you use our websites. The information that we collect about you through cookies is not personally identifiable. A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that uniquely identifies your browser. We use cookies for a variety of purposes, such as to improve the quality of our services and the design and content of our websites; to track user trends; to enable us to provide a more personalized experience when you browse our websites; and keep you up to date on products, promotions, and other email communications that may be of interest. We may also use technologies such as our own cookies to provide you with personalized online display advertising tailored to your interests. To opt out of this advertising, click here. Cookies may help us collect information about the browser types, pages visited, purchases made, date and time of your visit, and other click-stream data. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to be alerted when a cookie is being sent. However, some of our features and services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.
We also use third party providers to help us collect and analyze information on our websites and to measure the effectiveness of information displayed on our websites. Such service providers may place cookies on your computer on our behalf when you access our websites. For example, we work with Coremetrics to help us understand how users interact with our websites. Coremetrics will place cookies on your computer to collect information on our behalf, including information about which search engine referred you, which items you placed in shopping carts, which items you abandoned, and what purchases you made. Coremetrics then analyzes the information it collects from our websites, and reports back to us. We use the information to help us understand your interests and how to better serve you. It also helps us provide you with more personalized product offerings. You may choose to opt out of Coremetrics' collection and analysis of your browsing and purchasing data. You may also choose to continue to benefit from the improved shopping experience that Coremetrics’ analysis allows us to provide, but maintain your anonymity. Learn more about Coremetrics [See Coremetrics Opt Out implementation instructions] and the various levels of privacy and confidentiality you can select with respect to Coremetrics’ services, as well as how to exercise your opt out choices.

We may provide your information to carefully selected unaffiliated companies when we believe their products or services may be of interest to you or to other merchants and merchant exchanges who may, in turn, use such information for marketing purposes.
