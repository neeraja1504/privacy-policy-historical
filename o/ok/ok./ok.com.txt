OK.com Just the Good Stuff
This privacy statement sets forth the privacy practices of Ok.com.
Information we collect:
In addition to the profile information that you provide, we will collect and store any information that you send us when suggesting, reviewing and rating media. This includes your interest ratings, content voting, media reviews, etc. We also track the general usage of the website for traffic/analytical purposes. This causes us to use cookies (a computer code sequence that helps us determine each unique visitor) through applications such as Google Analytics.
What we do with that information:
Besides displaying review/rating information to all visitors of Ok.com to help them with their media choices (future versions of OK.com), we will use this information to help us, recommend to you, media based on your ratings and interests. This information will be available to the whole Ok.com Network, but not shared with any third-party.
Aggregated ratings and media reviews may be included through several distribution channels, such as email, mobile and other media devices. All of which are under and controlled by the Ok.com brand.
Who we share that information with:
Your information will not be shared outside of the Ok.com Network or sold to any third parties. We will not spam you, and will offer a unsubscribe link with every email that we send. We value your privacy and give you the ability to edit and delete your media reviews and disassociate your profile from all past ratings. We believe that your personal information belongs to you and that you should be in full control of it. If you have any questions or concerns about the usage of your data please contact us.
Collection of Information from Children.
The Site is not directed to, or intended for use by, children (defined as anyone under thirteen (13) years old). Children should not use or submit any information through the Site or its Services. If you are under the age of 13, you only may use the Services with permission from your parents or guardians. Deseret Digital Medial does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from users under the age of 13. If a child under 13 submits information through any part of the Services, and we become aware that the person submitting the information is a child, we will attempt to delete this information as soon as possible.
A publisher may choose to aggregate all media reviews and ratings across the entire Ok.com Network, or only display the information received from their own user base. The Ok.com reserves the right to change these policies with sufficient notice, for the purpose of protecting both the user and the brand.
