OKCOLLEGESTART.ORG PRIVACY POLICY AND ITS EXCEPTIONS
Except as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy Statement, personally identifiable data you enter on OKcollegestart.org are not made available or distributed to third parties, except with your express consent or at your express direction. In particular, OSRHE and/or XAP will not give, sell or provide access to your personal information to any company, individual or organization for its use in marketing or commercial solicitation or for any other purpose, except with your express consent, at your direction, as is necessary for the operation of this site, or pursuant to one of the exceptions listed below.
GENERAL EXCEPTIONS TO THE PRIVACY POLICY
There are limited exceptions to the OKcollegestart.org privacy policy. When required by law to comply with any valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, regulation or court order, OSRHE and/or XAP will supply such information contained in your OKcollegestart.org account as such entity reasonably determines, based on the advice of counsel, it is legally required to supply. In addition, OSRHE and/or XAP may release specific information relevant to special cases, such as a physical threat to you or others or an attempted breach of security on the OKcollegestart.org site.
THE PERSONAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION WE COLLECT
OKcollegestart.org collects personal identifying information from you including, but not limited to, your name, date of birth, address, e-mail address, telephone number, grade level, parent's e-mail address, current high school, graduation date, such additional information as you choose to include in your user profile or are required to provide by the college and financial aid applications that you choose to complete, and information associated with activities you have undertaken on OKcollegestart.org.
REASONS WE COLLECT YOUR PERSONAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION
OKcollegestart.org collects personal information from you for three reasons. The first reason is to perform a task on OKcollegestart.org, such as filling out a specific college admission application for or sending a transcript to the colleges, universities or other organizations that you specify. The second reason is to enable you to submit, in a convenient and efficient manner, information that is likely to be needed when you complete college admission, financial aid and other applications and forms made available through OKcollegestart.org or undertake a scholarship search on OKcollegestart.org. The third reason is to enable OSRHE and/or XAP to respond to your questions or contact you when necessary in connection with the functioning of OKcollegestart.org. When the effective functioning of an OKcollegestart.org module does not require personal information, none is collected, and any such module can be accessed without opening an account or providing any personal data.
When you log on to OKcollegestart.org, your browser will automatically transmit to OKcollegestart.org the IP address of your computer and type of browser you are using. Although your browser transmits the IP address of your computer, this IP address is not associated with any personally identifiable information regarding you. OKcollegestart.org does not collect any personally identifiable information other than what users submit and their browsers transmit.
CREATING AN ACCOUNT WHEN YOU ARE UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE
If you are not yet 13 years of age, OKcollegestart.org will allow you to create an account but will not collect any personal identifying information from you. Some features of OKcollegestart.org, such as the Resume Builder, that require personal information for effective use, will not be available. If you are 13 years of age or older, you are encouraged to create an account on OKcollegestart.org and to utilize all of OKcollegestart.org, which will help you plan, prepare and pay for your future education.
WAYS IN WHICH PERSONAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION MAY BE USED
OKcollegestart.org will use your personal identifying information to complete the following forms and surveys, to obtain information for you and to effect transactions on your behalf, in each case only upon your instructions to do so:
Complete applications for admission.
Sending transcripts to colleges and universities to which you have applied for admission or other destinations you specify such as the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) or the National Association of intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA)
Complete financial aid applications.
Complete financial aid calculators.
Complete a scholarship search.
Complete Your Plan of Study, which can assist you in selecting courses and otherwise planning to meet college admission requirements.
Communicate your requests for information or material to colleges or other institutions you have specified.
Your personal identifying information may also be used for the following purposes:
We may use your identifying information to help diagnose problems with the servers servicing OKcollegestart.org and to administer the OKcollegestart.org website.
Summary data representing a compilation of aggregate data representing OKcollegestart.org users may be collected by OSRHE and/or XAP and provided to various entities including colleges and other educational institutions utilizing OKcollegestart.org. NO PERSONAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION IS MADE AVAILABLE AS PART OF THESE SUMMARY REPORTS. Some examples of summary data are the number of monthly visitors to OKcollegestart.org, the number of admission applications submitted through OKcollegestart.org, and the OKcollegestart.org functions utilized by students in specified age or grade ranges.
WITH WHOM PERSONAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION MAY BE SHARED
Any time you request that we perform a task that involves a transfer of data, the data related to the performance of a task will be made available to a recipient you designate or to a service provider assisting us in completing that task. For example:
If you submit an application for admission to a college or other educational institution, the personal data required to complete that application will be provided on your behalf to the admissions office of the institution to which you are applying.
When you request that a transcript be sent to a college, university or other organization, the personal data required to be included on an official transcript will be provided on your behalf to the admissions office of the institution you specify.
Additionally, your data may be shared with our third party service partner to permit them to provide services on our behalf in sending your transcript(s) to some of the colleges and universities you have selected. (The third party service provider has agreed to handle your information in compliance with this Privacy Policy and may only use the information for the sole purpose of providing the transcript service to you).
If you request that a college or other educational institution send you material, your contact information will be provided to that institution.
When you submit a scholarship search your data may be shared with our third party service partner to permit them to provide services on our behalf in displaying available scholarships that correspond to your search criteria. (The third party service provider has agreed to handle your information in compliance with this Privacy Policy and may only use the information for the sole purpose of providing the scholarship search information to you).
Note: If you start an application for admission to a college or other educational institution, your name and other data entered on that application may be provided to the admissions office of that institution, even though you have not yet submitted that application to that institution.
If you connect your account to a school or other site using OKcollegestart.org as part of a career and education planning program, then professional staff at that school or site, designated by the administration of the school or site to have access to the OKcollegestart.org Professional Center, will be able to view your OKcollegestart.org portfolio including personally identifying information about you. This access is granted to these professional users so that they may assist you in a guidance capacity with your career and education planning. You have the option of not connecting your account to a school or site and making full use of OKcollegestart.org as an independent user.
