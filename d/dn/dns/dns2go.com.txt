In accordance with COPPA, Deerfield.com does not, at any time, knowingly collect information from, or market our products to, children under the age of 13.
All financial and personal information collected by, and on behalf of, Deerfield.com is held in the strictest confidentiality. Any information, such as an email address, billing and shipping addresses, and other contact information, submitted via a download form, purchase form, beta team registration, or newsletter subscription, remains the sole property of Deerfield.com. If a purchase is made via the Deerfield.com website in a currency other than US Dollars and/or a language other than English, information (such as an email address, billing and shipping addresses, financial details, and other contact information) is collected by our international transaction affiliate element5. This information is used to help us process payment and to send registration information to our customers.
Further, any third party personally identifiable information, submitted on your behalf by an outside party (e.g. in the case of the "tell-a-friend" feature, or a gift purchase) is treated with the same care as primary information. Any email addresses collected via a third party will be used to send a one time, invitation email.

In addition, if Deerfield.com makes any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our website notifying users of the change. In some cases when we post the notice we will also email those users who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.
There are also instances when Deerfield.com will use a "cookie" in order to track website usage.

The information gathered for the Deerfield.com User Forums is completely voluntary. A user need only enter a name and email address. Whether or not this information is displayed on the website is up to the user. This simply provides a means to interact with other Forum Users. This information is not required by Deerfield.com. Any information posted to a Users Forum is considered in the public domain.

Deerfield.com also operates SecureCC, a secure transaction site dedicated to completing secure online orders. When a purchase is made, using a credit card, via the Internet, the transaction will be automatically redirected to SecureCC. All of the Privacy policies of Deerfield.com would apply to SecureCC as well.
SecureCC uses Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to make the Internet a safe place to do business. This system integrates a number of different technologies to ensure that the information you transmit remains private and confidential. The typical PKI is made up of:
A certificate authority (CA), who issues and verifies digital certificates. These digital certificates contain information about the public keys that shoppers will use.
A registration authority (RA), the entity that acts as a verifier for the CA before a digital certificate goes out to a requestor. One (or more) directory where the certificates, and therefore the public keys as well, are stored.
A system of certificate management
A company using the PKI system is given a digital certificate. This certificate can automatically tell your browser that the site is a secure and legitimate business. Along with this certificate comes a number of Public Keys. The vendor site gives your computer one of the Public Keys to use during the transaction. Using this Public Key, you are able to send and receive secure information with the vendor by encrypting your data. The real strength of this system is in the Company Key. The vendor has a private key, known only to their system. It is able to decode the information that the Company's Public Keys encrypt. This Company Key is the only tool able to understand the encrypted messages.
For more details about the security measures on SecureCC, please visit the SecureCC website.
When a purchase is made via the Internet with a credit card, Deerfield.com uses a third party commerce service to verify credit card details. This company is sent the total price of the purchase, the card number and expiration date, and the cardholders name and billing address. All information transmitted to this third party is sent using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption. Using this method of information encryption further insures the privacy and security of all our customers. This information is used only to verify the account and clear the transaction.

We are also not responsible for the privacy policies in place on that site.

To further protect the privacy of our customers, access to information by our employees is restricted within the company. Only select employees with an absolute need to use that information, in order to better serve customers, are able to view any personal details submitted.
