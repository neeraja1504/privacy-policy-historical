Where your consent has been obtained for the processing of personal data, Article 6 I (a) DS-GMO is the legal basis for data processing. Given consent can be revoked at any time with effect for the future.
Contract
For the processing of personal data collected for the fulfilment of a contract to which you are a party, Article 6 I b) DS-GMO is the legal basis. This also applies to processing operations that are necessary to carry out pre-contractual measures.
Legal Requirements
As far as the processing of personal data is necessary for the fulfilment of a legal obligation to which our company is subject, Article 6 I c) DS-GMO serves as legal basis.
Vital Interests
In the event that vital interests of you or another natural person require the processing of personal data, Article 6 I (d) DS-GMO is the legal basis.
Justifiable Interest
If processing is necessary to safeguard a legitimate interest of our company or a third party and if the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not outweigh the former interest, Article 6 I f) DS-GMO serves as the legal basis for processing. The legitimate interest of our company lies in the implementation of our business activities.
