Privacy Policy
No information is sold or released to anyone about visitors to Dump.com without prior consent or a court order. In other words, no information is released to anyone unless you give permission first.
Dump.com does not attempt to collect personal information from children. Note that Dump.com cannot always determine that a user is a child. Dump.com does not maintain databases of children or adults.
When visiting any Internet site, your unique address called an "IP address" is recorded. Dump.com does not release any information about the collection of this address to any third party except under court order. Dump.com archives the log files in order to create aggregate statistical reports, detect errors on the web site, and for security reasons. The log files are eventually deleted.
IP reports for advertisement clicks are shared with the advertiser. However, they usually have this information already since it is captured by their server when you view or click an ad. This is done to verify billing for the ads. No additional information associated with any specific user is provided to the advertisers.
Overview
Your privacy is important to us. Dump.com's service is free for all to use, and prior registration is not needed.
