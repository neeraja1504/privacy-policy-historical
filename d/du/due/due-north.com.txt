(10) PROACTIS products
**PROACTIS products will typically require users to have a username and a password. The username may be a unique identifier or an email address. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone.
Any additional information required will be for the stated purposes for the application usage and not excessive.
PROACTIS Products will issue out system messages, to enable defined users to act upon processes that are necessary to fulfil the normal practices of the software (such as alerting an authoriser that they have invoices to approve or to alert a supplier that they have a deadline for a tender).
Whilst these are not marketing messages, users are able to change their preferences within product should they not wish to receive such notifications. By doing so, this may alter the functionality and lessen the effectiveness of the software.

(11) ProContract
The ProContract product operates an email newsletter program, which is used to inform subscribers about products and services supplied by PROACTIS. Users can subscribe through an online automated process, which is optional.
Some subscriptions may be manually processed through prior written agreement with the user.
Subscriptions are taken in compliance with UK Spam Laws, which are detailed in the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003.
All personal details relating to subscriptions are held securely and in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998.

(12) PROACTIS Central and Kayako Support
**PROACTIS Central (proactissupport.co.uk, proactissupport.com) and Kayako Support (proactis.kayako.com) (which is also known as Supplier Support) are web-based applications, designed to allow registered users to raise support enquiries regarding the PROACTIS products and services.
Kayako is a third-party application and PROACTIS uses its’ software for Suppliers to log enquiries. It is recommended that you review their privacy policy (kayako.com/about/privacy) in addition to this, should you also use that support software.
As part of the registration process, and to fulfil the enquiries raised in the systems, the following personal data will be captured:
A person’s name, email address, telephone number, company or organisation that person works for, job role.
Whilst the nature of each enquiry is related to the products and services PROACTIS supplies, it is possible that users can add other information to the enquiry which may end up being other personal data, though this should only be for the purposes of resolving that particular enquiry.
To fulfil these enquiries for our customers, the PROACTIS staff who work on the enquiries may be based in any PROACTIS office, in addition to those based in the UK. PROACTIS has offices in the United States, Europe (such as France and Germany) and Australasia (such as New Zealand and Philippines) where support services can be carried out.
PROACTIS will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and has processes in place to help prevent unauthorised access to confidential information about you that is under our control.
For example, complying with internationally recognised standards such as ISO 27001 (more information is here: iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-security.html).
The United States offices comply with the US-EU Privacy Shield Framework (more information about this is here: privacyshield.gov and listed as Perfect Commerce here: privacyshield.gov/list).
These safeguards help prevent unauthorised access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of Data.
