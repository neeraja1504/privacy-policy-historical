This section explains how and why we use cookies on our Sites.
Cookies are small files that reside on your data storage device (such as a computer or smartphone) and store information about your use of our Site. Cookies help us to improve our Site and deliver a more personalized service. Generally speaking, cookies enable us to:

speed up your searches; and,
recognise you when you return to our Site.
For your information, we use the following specific types of cookies on our Site:
“Strictly necessary cookies”: These are cookies that are required for the operation of a website. They include, for example, cookies that enable users to log into secure areas of a website, use a shopping cart or make use of e-billing services.
“Analytical/performance cookies”: These types of cookies allow providers to recognise and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around their website when they are using it. This assists providers in improving the way their website works, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily.
