Disclosure of data to third parties
We do not provide your personal data (including home address or email address) to third parties without your expressed and, at any time, revocable permission. Exceptions are only made for our service partners who require such data in order to complete an order process (eg.

to any other third party with your prior consent to do so.

The security of your personal information is important to DubLi.  When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
