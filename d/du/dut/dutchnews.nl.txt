Privacy policy
We are currently working to become GDPR compliant.
At DutchNews.nl we collect information about our users for three main reasons:
To help us to monitor and improve the services we offer.
For statistical purposes to track how many individual unique users we have and how often they visit our websites.
To sell advertising space on the site. This helps us to keep the site free of charge.
We do not monitor individual traffic patterns on our site. We only collect aggregate reader information.
We do collect information on our users through registration for the newsletter, through Google Analytics, and when you enter sales promotions and competitions.
We will respect your privacy. If you have signed up for our newsletter, or given us your email address in connection with a survey or promotion, we will not sell or pass on your details to any other company. We may very occasionally send marketing emails to you on behalf of trusted partners.
