We may obtain some information about you from third parties. For example, during the Start Service process, Duke Energy supplements the information you provide through our Digital Services with additional data received from third-party sources. We also may supplement your information with additional information we receive from a credit check performed when you apply for certain services. This information helps us to verify, update and correct the information our customers provide to us and enables us to determine if a deposit will be needed to provide you with services.

_Automated Collection of Data  _
When you interact with our Digital Services or open our emails, we may obtain certain information by automated means, such as browser cookies, web beacons, device identifiers, server logs, and other technologies. A “browser cookie” is a text file that we save on your device when you use our Digital Services. Cookies allow us to uniquely identify users and to store information or settings. A “web beacon,” also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, is a clear picture file that allows us and third parties to store information about your interactions with our Digital Services, such as how you use the Digital Services and view our content.
We may use these automated technologies to collect information about your devices, browsing actions, and usage patterns. The information we obtain in this manner may include your device IP address, Internet service provider, identifiers associated with your devices, domain name, device and operating system type and characteristics, web browser characteristics, language preferences, information about your interactions with and preferences on our Digital Services (such as clickstream data), the webpage from which you link to or from our Digital Services, dates and times of access to our Digital Services, and other information about your use of our Digital Services. These technologies help us (1) remember your information so you will not have to re-enter it; (2) track and understand how you use and interact with our Digital Services; (3) tailor our Digital Services around your preferences; (4) measure the usability of our Digital Services; (5) understand the effectiveness of our communications; (6) identify, diagnose and resolve technical issues; and (7) otherwise manage and enhance our Digital Services (and our other products and services) and help ensure they are working properly.
You can manage cookies through your web browser. Most web browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new browser cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new browser cookie and how to disable existing cookies. You can find out how to do this for your particular browser by clicking “help” on your browser’s menu or by visiting www.allaboutcookies.org. In addition, your mobile device settings may allow you to prohibit mobile app platforms (such as Apple and Google) from sharing certain information obtained by automated means with mobile app developers and operators such as us. Please note, however, that without cookies and similar technologies we use, you may not be able to take full advantage of all features of our Digital Services. Our Digital Services currently do not respond to “Do Not Track” signals.
We also may receive your mobile device’s precise geolocation. We may use this information to provide you with location-based services, such as to assist you with finding a nearby payment location. This information is not stored by us for future use. Your device may provide you with a notification when the Digital Services attempt to collect your precise geolocation. Location services can be turned off within the settings of your mobile device.
We may use the information we obtain about you to:
provide and manage our services, including to process, evaluate, communicate and fulfill requests, inquiries and claims we receive in connection with our services;
create, manage, administer and communicate with you about your account, including identifying and authenticating you so you may access your account or use certain features of our Digital Services;

_Third-Party Online Analytics Services  _
Through our Digital Services, we may obtain personal information about your online activities over time and across third-party apps, websites, devices and other online services. We use third-party online analytics services on our Digital Services, such as those of Google Analytics. The service providers that administer these analytics services use automated technologies to collect data (such as email, IP addresses, cookies and other device identifiers) to evaluate, for example, use of our Digital Services and to diagnose technical issues. For more information about how Google Analytics collects and processes data and the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, please visit https://policies.google.com/privacy#infocollect and https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites.
In our Digital Services, we may use certain Google Analytics advertising features, such as Remarketing with Google Analytics, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting, and integrated services that require Google Analytics to collect data for advertising purposes, including the collection of data via advertising cookies and identifiers. In connection with these Google Analytics advertising features, Google Analytics may collect data about your traffic via Google advertising cookies and identifiers. To learn more about how Google uses this information, please visit www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/.

_Online Tracking and Interest-Based Advertising  _
Through our Digital Services, both we and certain third parties may collect information about your online activities to provide you with advertising about products, services and corporate initiatives tailored to your individual interests. Where required by applicable law, we will obtain your consent for the processing of your personal information for direct marketing purposes. You may see our ads on other websites or mobile apps because we participate in advertising networks. Ad networks allow us to target our messaging to users considering demographic data, users’ inferred interests and browsing context. These networks track users’ online activities over time by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of browser cookies, web beacons, device identifiers, server logs and other similar technologies. The networks use this information to show ads that may be tailored to individuals’ interests, to track users’ browsers or devices across multiple websites and apps, and to build a profile of users’ online browsing and app usage activities. The information our ad networks may collect includes data about users’ visits to websites and apps that participate in the relevant ad networks, such as the pages or ads viewed and the actions taken on the websites or apps. This data collection takes place both on our Digital Services and on third-party websites and apps that participate in the ad networks. This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.
