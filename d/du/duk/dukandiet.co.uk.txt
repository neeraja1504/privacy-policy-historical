1.          Types of Information Collected
In order to better provide you with our numerous services and products, we collect two types of information about our users: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information. Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customised experience while using our Site.
(a)       Personally Identifiable Information: This refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are. When you engage in certain activities on this Site, such as registering for diet coaching services, or ordering products, submitting content and/or posting content in discussion forums or other public areas, entering a contest or sweepstakes, filling out a survey, or sending us feedback, we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself by filling out and submitting an online form.
It is completely optional for you to engage in these activities; however, we may ask that you provide us personal information, such as your first and last name, mailing address (including zip code), e-mail address, telephone and facsimile numbers, birth date (primarily for eligibility purposes) and billing and payment information and other personally identifying information. Depending upon the activity, some of the information we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity. Unless you give us permission to do so, we will not sell, share, license, trade or rent your Personally Identifiable Information other than as specified in this Privacy Policy
(b)       Non-Personally Identifiable Information: This refers to information that does not by itself identify or contact a specific individual. We gather certain information about you when you subscribe to one of our diet coaching programmes. This information is compiled and analysed on both a personal and an aggregated basis.
This information may include demographic information (like age, profession or gender) and health information (such as your current and desired weight).
Non-Personally Identifiable Information may also include the Web site's Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”) that you just came from, which URL you next go to, what browser you are using, and/or your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address. A URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web. An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (“TCP/IP”) network, such as the World Wide Web. Networks like the Web use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address of the destination. In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web, allowing Web servers to locate and identify your computer. Computers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet.
(c)       Information from other sources. We may also supplement the information we collect with information from other sources to assist us in evaluating and improving our Site, to determine your preferences so that we can tailor our Site to your needs.
2.          Collection Methods and Use of Information
(a)       Régime Coach does not collect any Personally Identifiable Information about you unless you voluntarily provide it to us.
You provide certain Personally Identifiable Information to us when you:
- register for our services and register your e-mail address with us;

- sign up for special offers from selected third parties;
- send e-mail messages, submit forms, or transmit other information by telephone or letter; or
- submit your credit card or other payment information when ordering and purchasing products and services on our site.
We may also collect information from you at other points on our site that state that such information is being collected.
(b)       In addition, we may also collect, or our third-party ad server and/or content server may collect, certain Non-Personally Identifiable Information.
This information is ultimately stored in the form of store categories, and, in some cases, specific URLs. We use your IP address to diagnose problems with our servers, software, to administer our site, and to gather demographic information. Our third-party ad servers will also provide us with summary, but not individual, reports that will tell us how many ads were presented and clicked upon at our Site.
(c)       We will primarily use your Personally Identifiable Information to provide our services to you, as required by our agreements with you.
We will also use Personally Identifiable Information to enhance the operation of our Site, fill orders, improve our marketing and promotional efforts, statistically analyze Site use, improve our product and service offerings, and customize our Site's content, layout, and services.
We may use Personally Identifiable Information to deliver information to you and to contact you regarding administrative notices.

regimecoaching.com does not sell, trade, or rent your Personally Identifiable Information to others.
We do provide some of our services through contractual arrangements with affiliates, services providers, partners, and other third parties. We, and our service partners use your Personally Identifiable Information to operate our sites and to deliver their services. For example, we must release your credit card information to the card-issuing bank to confirm payment for products and services purchased on this site; release your address information to the delivery service to deliver products that you ordered; and provide order information to third parties that help us provide customer service.
We will encourage our service partners to adopt and post privacy policies. However, the use of your Personally Identifiable Information by our service partners is governed by the privacy policies of those service partners and is not subject to our control.

7.         Security of Information
At our site, you can be assured that your Personally Identifiable Information is secure, consistent with current industry standards. The importance of security for all Personally Identifiable Information associated with our users is of utmost concern to us. Your Personally Identifiable Information is protected in several ways.

We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone.
In addition, your Personally Identifiable Information resides on a secure server that only selected Diet Coaching personnel and contractors have access to via password.

They receive the information needed to verify and authorize your credit card or other payment information and to process and ship your order.

Additionally, other companies which place advertising on our Site may collect information about you when you view or click on their advertising through the use of cookies.
