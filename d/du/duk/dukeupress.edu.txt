Website Security and Data Protection
Duke University Press takes website and data security seriously. All website data is stored in PCI-DSS–compliant environments using industry standard security protocols. Access to personal data is restricted to personnel who have a valid business reason for their access. Duke University Press uses TLS/SSL (i.e., HTTPS) to provide data security and integrity throughout its sites. Duke University Press NEVER stores credit card numbers and will NEVER ask you to supply it over the email or any other insecure method.
Cookies
To make Duke University Press’s websites work properly, we sometimes place small data files called cookies on your device, which is a common practice for websites across the internet. A cookie is a small text file that a website saves on your computer or mobile device when you visit the site, respond to surveys, or participate in polls. It enables our website to remember your actions and preferences (such as login, language, font size, and other display preferences) over a period of time, so you don’t have to keep re-entering them when you come back to the site or browse from one page to another.
Cookies do not give us access to information that will identify you personally. We can use them to identify your computer, and aggregated cookie information from you and users like you helps us analyze traffic patterns on our site and can help us provide you with a better experience by improving content and making the site easier to use. If you do not want Duke University Press to use cookies in your browser, you can set your browser to reject cookies or to notify you when a website tries to put a cookie in your browser software. If you choose not to accept cookies from Duke University Press, you can still access the majority of our website; however, your ability to use some of the services may be affected.

We make efforts to collect only data that is necessary to conduct business with Duke University Press and improve user experience of our sites. Duke University Press may use industry standard analytics tools such as Google Analytics to better understand the needs of its users. Information these analytics tools may collect includes IP addresses, device and software identifiers, referring and exit URLs, onsite behavior and usage information, feature use metrics and statistics, usage and purchase history, MAC Address, mobile unique device ID, geolocation, demographic and interest data, and other similar information.
Analytics companies may combine the information collected by us with other information they have independently collected from other websites and/or other online or mobile products and services relating to your activities across their network of websites, as well as online and/or mobile products and services. Many of these companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies.
