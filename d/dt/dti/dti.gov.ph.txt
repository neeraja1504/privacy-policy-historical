WEBSITE PRIVACY POLICY
Introduction
The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), through its Knowledge Management and Information Service (KMIS), maintains www.dti.gov.ph, which aims to provide information about the Department, its mandates, programs, and services.
As an agency of the government of the Republic of the Philippines, the website adheres to the Government Website Template Design (GWTD) Guidelines prescribed by the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT), which highlights, among others, compliance with the Data Privacy Act of 2012 (Section 2.3.5) and recognizing the importance of improving user experience (Section 3).

The type of data that are obtained include:
Sex

The non-personal data being collected using Google Forms is governed by the external website’s own privacy policy.
