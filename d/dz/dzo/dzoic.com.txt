| DZOIC Development collects information in 2 sections of our site. Some personal information is gathered when you register for a demo of DZOIC Handshakes software (although you can use a preset testing account and do not provide your personal/contact information while testing the demo at all). During registration, we ask for your email address. The system will also ask for your first name, last name, and the URL of your web site. This information is used by DZOIC to associate the order of Handshakes script with you and to create a necessary product license key, which will be sent to the email address which you provided during purchase.
