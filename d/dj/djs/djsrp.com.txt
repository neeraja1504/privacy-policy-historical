Children’s Privacy
Diablo does not solicit or knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If Diablo obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personally identifiable information from a child under the age of 13, Diablo will immediately delete such information from its database. Because Diablo does not collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13, Diablo has no such information to use or disclose to third parties. Diablo has designed this Privacy Policy in order to comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).
Information Collection

Like most website operators, Diablo automatically gathers information of the sort that browsers automatically make available, including: (i) IP addresses; (ii) domain servers; (iii) types of computers accessing the Website; and (iv) types of Web browsers accessing the Website (collectively “Traffic Data”). Traffic Data is anonymous information that does not personally identify you.
(b) Ad Serving. Diablo uses third-parties for advertising and analytics for pages that we host. These third-parties may place Cookies on your machine, use web beacons, gather IP addresses and log data to collect traffic and activity data to send to the United States in order to deliver relevant metrics, content, and advertising.
(c) Advertiser and Publisher Application Information. To enroll in our Services, you are required to become an advertiser or publisher to receive appropriate information. You will be asked to provide Diablo certain information that personally identifies you and/or your company (“Personal Information”). Personal Information includes, without limitation: (1) “Contact Data” (such as your name, phone number, fax number, mailing address e-mail address, and website URLs) and (2) “Financial Data” (such as your credit/debit card number and expiration date). In each case, you will be asked to provide information; the Website will not gather it surreptitiously. The information revealed in an application is stored safely on the company’s information databases and is never accessed by unauthorized third parties. Diablo may supplement the information you provide with additional Personal Information gathered from public sources or from third-parties (e.g., consumer reporting agencies) who may lawfully provide such information to Diablo. An application must be completed in full in order to be accepted. Applicants who do not meet specific criteria will not be approved or admitted into the affiliate network. If you do not wish to submit your personal information, please do not complete or send an application. You are under no obligation to provide your information, with the caveat that your refusal to do so may prevent you from using certain of the Services. Applying as either advertiser or publisher does not guarantee approval and is subject to review.

(b) By Law or to Protect Rights. Diablo discloses Personal Information when required to do so by law, or in response to a subpoena or court order, or when Diablo believes in its sole discretion that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Diablo, third parties or the public at large.
(c) Business Transfers; Bankruptcy. Diablo reserves the right to transfer all Personal Information in its possession to a successor organization in the event of a merger, acquisition, or bankruptcy or other sale of all or a portion of Diablo’s assets.
