DJ TechTools Privacy Policy - DJ TechTools
*DJ Techtools values our members and readers more than anything.  *Our basic policy in all decisions is to be “way cool” and not do anything you would find lame.
Here’s how we collect information:
We collect email addresses when you give them your permission. These are used only by DJ TechTools employees for the purpose collected (mostly our free newsletter or to tell you when you buy something from us). Your email or information will never be traded, sold or bartered to anyone.
We track how well our ads perform through cookies. This helps us show you better ads and not tell our readers about stupid stuff they don’t even like anyway.
We also use third-party tools (for example: Google Analytics) to track how you are using this site, so we can improve it and make things work better. These also rely on cookies, which are stored on your computer. You can access the site without cookies, or delete yours at any time.
None of the information we collect will ever be given away, sold, or traded to anyone without the users’ consent.
The Bottom Line:  We collect information on how our members interact with and use the site so we can build a better DJ community, and that information is never provided to anyone else. Sweet!

California Online Privacy Protection Act
CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. – See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf
According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:
Users can visit our site anonymously.

Our Privacy Policy link includes the word ‘Privacy’ and can easily be found on the page specified above.

Fair Information Practices
The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.
In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:
We will notify all potentially effected users via email within 7 business days
We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
CAN SPAM Act
The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.
We collect your email address in order to:
Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions
Process orders and to send information and updates pertaining to orders.
Send you additional information related to your product and/or service
Market to our mailing list or continue to send emails to you after you complete a transaction on our webstore

Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters.
Monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.
