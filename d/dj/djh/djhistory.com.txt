We value our privates so we protect your privacy carefully, and make sure your personal details don't fall into the wrong hands. We follow all UK regulations about holding personal data, including the Data Protection Act and the Freedom of Information Act.

Your information
** ** If you join www.djhistory.com we take your name, country and email address, so we can let you post content on the public areas of the site, and email you about new releases, special tracks and other DJhistory news. We will only email you if you have given your permission, or to contact you about an order. When you buy something we collect the information we need to complete your order, including name, address, email address, payment details and your delivery address for any physical items. We will keep a record of what you buy in case there are any problems. The only other time we would share your information is if required to do so by law, in connection with legal proceedings, to defend our legal rights, or to prevent fraud.
Security
When you enter your card details these go straight to an extremely secure server at our payment gateway (or PayPal if you're paying that way). We don't keep any of your payment details. Stay safe by keeping your username and password secret, change your password regularly and log out at the end of each session. Tell us immediately if anyone uses your login without your permission, or about any other breach of the website's security.
