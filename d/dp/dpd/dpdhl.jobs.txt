As of July 13, 2016
Deutsche Post AG (hereinafter called 'Deutsche Post DHL Group') is pleased that you have visited our website and are interested in our company, products and services. It is important to us to protect your personal data during handling throughout the entire business process. We want you to feel secure when you visit our Internet pages.
In the following, we explain what information Deutsche Post DHL Group collects when you visit our website and how this information is used.
Personal data
Personal data is specific information about personal or factual characteristics relating to a certain natural person or a natural person who can be specified. This includes information such as your real name, address, telephone number and date of birth. Information that cannot be directly linked to your real identity - such as favorite websites or number of users of a site - is not considered personal data.
Collection and processing of personal data
Deutsche Post DHL Group is committed to preserving the privacy of users of our website. When you visit our web pages, our web servers always temporarily save for security purposes the connection data of the computer connecting to our site, a list of the web pages that you visit within our site, the date and duration of your visit, the identification data of the type of browser and operation system used as well as the website through which you linked to our site. Additional personal information such as your name, address, telephone number or e-mail address is not collected unless you provide this data voluntarily, e.g. while completing an online contact form, as part of a registration, survey, competition, fulfillment of contract or an information request.
Utilization and passing on of personal data
We use the personal data which you have made available to us exclusively for technical administration of the web pages and to fulfill your wishes and requests - thus primarily for fulfillment of a contract concluded with you or to answer your request.
Only when you have previously granted your approval or - if so stipulated by legal regulations - have not raised an objection do we also use this data for product-related surveys and marketing purposes.
Deutsche Post DHL Group does not share, sell, transfer or otherwise disseminate your personal data to third parties and will not do so in future, unless required by law, unless required for the purpose of the contract or unless you have given express consent to do so. For instance, it may be necessary to pass on your address and order data to our contractors when you order products.
Information from the Group
The Deutsche Post DHL Group companies would like to contact you in order to provide you with the latest information about updates to our website or our offers, news, products and services. If you contact or register on our web pages, we sometimes request that you indicate whether or not you would like to receive direct advertising material from us. If you are already a customer of Deutsche Post DHL Group, you will naturally continue to receive necessary information about important changes in connection with existing contracts (e.g. rate changes).
Use of web tracking
We use tracking software to determine how many users visit our website and how often. We do not use this software to collect individual personal data or individual IP addresses. The data are used solely in anonymous and summarized form for statistical purposes and for developing the website.
