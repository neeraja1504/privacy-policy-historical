Texas Public Information Act
The Texas Public Information Act requires disclosure of information by a public body -- unless the law specifically protects the information. Most information kept by a public body is public under the Act. The State Attorney General enforces this Act. View additional information about the Texas Public Information Act.
Family Education Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA)
FERPA protects educational records of a student from public disclosure without written permission of the student. Although many exceptions to the Act exist, the exceptions are very limited. The Department of Education enforces this Act. View additional information about FERPA.

Directory Information
Unless you request that your information be withheld, to comply with FERPA, DCCCD may release information classified as "directory information" to the general public without the written consent of the student. Directory information includes:
name;
home address;
home telephone number;
email addresses;
field of study;
photograph;
dates of attendance;
enrollment status, i.e., full-time, part-time, undergraduate, graduate;
degrees, certificates and other honors and awards received;
the type of award received, i.e., academic, technical, tech-prep, or continuing education;
participation in officially recognized activities;
weight and height of members of athletic teams;
student classification;
name of the most recent previous institution attended.
How to request that your directory information be withheld
A student may request that the institution withhold from the public all or any part of the student's directory information. To request withholding of this information, a student shall give written notice (in person, by mail or fax) to the Registrar's Office during the first 12 class days of a Fall or Spring semester or the first four class days of a Summer session. If they are unable to provide written notice within these time frames, credit students may protect their directory information at any time during the academic year through eConnect's 'My Privacy' feature. If a request to withhold information is not made, the institution shall release all directory information.
Directory information is released only upon written request unless permitted by law. Telephone requests are not acceptable. Transcripts or academic records are not released without a student's written consent except as allowed by law.

1) the information you entrust to us is not intercepted or abused; and 2) to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.
Industry standard technologies like Secure Socket Layers (SSL) are used to protect your credit card information, email address, social security number and other information so it cannot be read as it travels on the Internet.
