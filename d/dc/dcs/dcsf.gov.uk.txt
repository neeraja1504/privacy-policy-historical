Policy statements : Department for Children, Schools and Families
Under the Data Protection Act 1998, the Department and its contractors have legal obligations towards you in the way that we deal with data collected from you. We use leading technologies and encryption software to safeguard your data, and keep strict security standards to prevent any unauthorised access to it. We do not pass on your details to any third party or government department unless you give us permission to do so, or we are obliged or permitted by law to disclose it.
The Department for Children, Schools and Families' website, with the exception of the registration systems and the Discussions facility, does not store or capture personal information, but merely logs the user's IP address (Internet Protocol: standard allowing data to be transmitted between two devices) which is automatically recognised by the webserver.
The Department's site uses cookies for collecting user information from the site; it does not collect any information about you except that required for system administration of the website. In order to continuously improve the Department's website, we use tracking technology which monitors user sessions via a Java applet which activates a session cookie. No information is stored on your computer and no personal data is obtained from this software.
If you register to receive updates your information will be held on a secure server. It will be used only to provide you with e-mail updates on the topics you have requested or postal information if you request that service. If you respond online to a consultation exercise your data will only be used to facilitate the analysis of responses. This privacy statement only covers this Department's website at www.dcsf.gov.uk and subsequent subsites of that domain. Other websites linked to from the Department's domain are not covered by this privacy statement.
This site is taking part in a pilot project sharing campaign material across government. The pilot uses cookies to avoid you seeing the same campaign repeatedly, over and over, and to gauge the number of people viewing a campaign or particular web page. These cookies are pieces of data created when you visit a site, and contain a unique, anonymous number. They are restored in the cookie directory of your hard drive, and do not expire at the end of your session.
