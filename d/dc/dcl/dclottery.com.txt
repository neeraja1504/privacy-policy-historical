To provide better service and a more effective website, sections of this site may use "cookies" as part of our interaction with your browser. A cookie is a small text file (typically only a few bytes) that we place on your hard drive to allow our server to identify your computer. Our cookies will not attempt to read any information on your hard drive, and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personal information to determine your identity or your email address.
When you visit certain areas of this site, you may be asked to provide personally identifiable information (such as name, address, telephone number, email address, etc.) that we need to process your request. In the event that you decline to provide such information, you limit our ability to serve you. Still, we invite you to continue to visit the site and take advantage of the wealth of information it offers.
The DC Lottery may occasionally survey website users for their voluntary opinions on games or other matters of interest to lottery players, as well as for marketing and/or statistical analysis.
