Privacy Policy for dcrainmaker.com, DC Rainmaker
DC Rainmaker (well, I) takes user privacy very seriously. Absolutely no information submitted to DC Rainmaker via the contact form, comments form, or DCR newsletter/mailing list will be given out, sold, or distributed to any outside organization (unless you win a giveaway, or specifically ask me to share your concern/comment with a company). Your contact information is used to contact you (the visitor) with information from DC Rainmaker. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings by contacting DC Rainmaker, or using the subscription management form.
DCRainmaker.com uses third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit the Web site. These third-party advertising companies may use advertising technologies such as cookies, web beacons and other similar advertising technologies.  These companies may use aggregated information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.

Third Party Links: DCRainmaker.com offers affiliate links on the site. DCRainmaker.com is in no way responsible for the content of these websites. Please be sure to read their Privacy Policies and terms of use for information regarding those particular sites.
Post Comments: Any public comments left on the site are indeed public, and as such, searchable via search engines.  Your e-mail address is never posted publicly, nor available to any 3rd parties.  Publicly made comments cannot be removed except on a case by case basis, relating only to user privacy and/or comments that violate the rules of the site. When a comment is left an e-mail address is required and logged (real or otherwise), and an IP address is logged. This e-mail address is NOT shared with any 3rd parties, nor is the IP address.
DCR Supporters: Paid DCR Supporters are treated exactly the same way as newsletter subscribers. No personal subscriber data is shared with any 3rd parties. Period.  By default, you will receive regular newsletters from DCR, for which you can unsubscribe if you’d like to.  You can request to remove your account at any time using the ‘Contact’ form option on the site. Note you will receive an e-mail notification/reminders for renewal each year (unless you cancel your subscription). The IP address you signed up with will be logged for security reasons.  All payment is handled by PayPal, and you will need to refer to their privacy policies for any PayPal-specific items.
DCR Analyzer: All data uploaded to the DCR Analyzer is considered private unless you select to make a set public. Once a set is made public it is accessible only via the shared URL specified on the set page.  The original files are available for any data set, which can include your GPS information (such as your exact start/stop locations). You can remove public access at any time.  If you’d like to remove all of your data from the DCR Analyzer and/or close your account, you can request to do so via the ‘Contact’ form.  You can download your existing sets at any time using the ‘Download Set’ option from within the Dashboard.  Note you will receive an e-mail notification/reminders for renewal each year (unless you cancel your subscription). Your IP address may be logged for security reasons.
Google Analytics and StatCounters: Both of these platforms are analytics based platforms that track views and visits to this website. As a 3rd party, you should refer to both Google Analytics and SiteMeter’s and StatCounter’s respective privacy policies for how they handle information.  From a DC Rainmaker perspective, we do not share ANY private data (such as IP addresses) with any entity.  Summary information (such as total page views or country traffic) is used in relation to site trending, and may be shared with 3rd parties.
Thanks!
