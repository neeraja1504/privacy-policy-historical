BMW CAR SHARING LLC
PRIVACY POLICY
1.     Introduction. BMW Car Sharing, LLC (“BMWCS”) provides car sharing
services in certain cities in the United States by making BMW and MINI vehicles
(including BMW electric vehicles) available to people who meet its membership criteria
and are approved as members. You must apply for membership, be authorized by
BMWCS and enter into a Membership Agreement with BMWCS (the “Membership
Agreement”) before reserving or operating any BMWCS vehicle.
2.     Scope. BMWCS appreciates the trust you place in us and does not want
to jeopardize that trust. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting the
security of your personal information. This Privacy Policy applies to the BMWCS
website, located at www.bmwcarsharing.com (the “Website”) and the BMWCS mobile
application (the “App”) and other websites or applications that link to or display this
Privacy Policy (collectively, the “Technology Platform”). By accessing or using the
Technology Platform, you hereby consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy and
the BMWCS Mobile Application and Website Terms of Use (the “Terms of Use”).
If you do not consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy and Terms of Use, please do
not use our Technology Platform, products or services.
3.     What Information Does [BMWCS] Collect? As part of evaluating your
application to join BMWCS and providing you with our products and services, we, and
third parties engaged by us, obtain personally identifiable information about you
including, but not limited to, your first and last name, home or other physical address,
email address, phone number, date of birth, drivers’ license information, personal photo,
and credit card information. As part of the application process for joining BMWCS, we,
or a third party engaged by us, will also run a Driver Record Check (as defined in the
Membership Agreement) on you. We may also collect information from you as
described in Section 6 below.
4.     How Does [BMWCS] Use My Information? Our primary goals in
collecting personally identifiable information from you are to: (a) enable us to approve or
disapprove your membership status (on an ongoing basis) in accordance with the
Membership Qualification Standards (as defined in the Membership Agreement); (b)
facilitate efficient transactions; and (c) provide you with information regarding relevant
products and services. We may also use information we collect from you to improve or
develop new products, services or websites; conduct research or analysis; comply with
legal requirements; or other purposes. We, or third parties engaged by us, may store
any information we collect from you.
5.     What Information Does [BMWCS] Share? We will share personally
identifiable information with certain third parties in order to process your application to
join BMWCS and as part of providing you with our products and services. For example,
we may share personally identifiable information with members of the BMW Group or
any subsidiaries of any member of the BMW Group who may assist us in providing
offers for products or services that may be of interest to you. Members of the BMW
Group include, but are not limited to, BMW AG, BMW of North America, BMW Financial
Services, BMW Bank of North America and BMW Insurance Agency. We may also
share personally identifiable information with non-affiliated companies that market our
products and services, such as our retail centers who are distinct entities and have their
own privacy policies. We may also share information about you and your reservation
and use of rental vehicles with law enforcement officials or other third parties in
connection with traffic and parking violation citations; accident reports; tolls; and other
citations, violations, fines, or similar items. We may also share personally identifiable
information with non-affiliated companies that provide services on our behalf (including,
but not limited to, insurance companies, customer support companies, mail fulfillment
companies, or identification verification companies). For example, we have engaged
Jumio, an identification credentials authentication company, to verify the identification
you submit to us and so we will share information submitted by you to Jumio including,
but not limited to, the information contained on, and an image of, your driver’s license
and a comparison photo. Jumio may store these images and information. The third
parties listed in this Section 5 are not exclusive. We may engage other third parties to
assist us with providing you with our products and services from time to time, without
notice to you, and we may share any and all information we collect from you with such
third parties subject to applicable law.
6.     Confidentiality. In certain areas of the Technology Platform you may
choose to share personal information with us, such as your name, address or even your
driving interests. We may use this information for marketing research and other
marketing and service related purposes like sending brochures you request and
keeping in touch by email. Where required or permitted by law, we may share your
personal information with our related companies, our business partners or others. We
may transfer information about you to a company that acquires the assets of [BMWCS]
or one of our business units, for example, as a result of a sale, merger, reorganization
or liquidation. Customer telephone calls may be recorded to protect you and our staff.
7.     Registration and Personal Settings. Before you may reserve a car, you
must register and be approved as a member and enter into a Membership Agreement.
Registered members may access the reservation system and correct or update their
personal information by entering their login ID and password. To edit, delete or add to
information you have shared while visiting our Technology Platform, log in and go to the
[General and Personal Data] section. If you notify us that any information you provided
us (such as ZIP code or email address) has changed, we will endeavor to correct or
update your personal data. If your membership of BMWCS is terminated for any reason,
we may keep the information we have collected from you for a period of time to be
determined in our sole discretion subject to applicable law. Additionally, the information
you include in a registration or reservation request is secure while in transit to us.
