We have no control over how your data is collected, stored or used by other websites and We advise you to check the privacy policies of any such websites before providing any data to them.
1. The types of information we collect from you

NPII may be analyzed and/or compiled on an aggregate or personal basis.

A. Website Use – AbeApps Pte Ltd. may collect information through the use of cookies, log files, web analytic tools, subscription sign ups, contact us forms, and other means of communication as may be made available on our websites.
Cookies – When you use our websites we may store cookies on your computer in order to facilitate and customize your use of our websites. A cookie is a small data text file, which a website stores on your computer’s hard drive (if your web browser permits) that can be later retrieved to identify you to us.

We are able to look up information about your preferences, origin, and other information about you and your devices in order to save you time by eliminating the need to enter the same information repeatedly. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits. However, some parts of our websites may not work properly and some services may not be available if you decline to accept our cookies. If a third party ad serving company is used to display advertisements on our websites they may, as a part of their service, place a separate cookie on your computer. However, these companies will not be given any of your PII without your consent.

Web Analytics Tools – AbeApps Pte Ltd. or third parties we have contracted or sub-contracted may employ the use of website analytic tools.

A. How our systems combine information and how we store, transfer, retain, and protect your information?
Our Systems – All PII is recorded in our ecommerce system and all NPII is stored in a separate tracking system. A user’s PII and NPII are linked by way of the fact that their information in both
systems is categorized under the same unique identification number (UID). Due to the shared UID number in these systems, all information collected and stored in both systems is treated by AbeApps Pte Ltd. as PII. However, neither system is able to use nor automatically access the information stored in the other. Where the NPII collected is disassociated from the UID, the information collected is treated as
NPII. Where such Mix Panel is a third party application utilized by AbeApps Pte Ltd. for the purpose of securely hosting Customer Relations Management (CRM). AbeApps Pte Ltd. analyzes data collected on an aggregate basis to optimize ecommerce flow and marketing campaigns.
Storage of Your Information – Information that we collect may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which we, our subsidiaries, affiliates, contractors, representatives, agents, or resellers maintain such information.

For the same purposes the information may be shared with partners and vendors that process information on behalf of AbeApps Pte Ltd., including, for instance, banking and credit card partners to process payments made by you on our site. AbeApps Pte Ltd. has taken steps so that the collected information, if transferred, receives an adequate level of protection.
Data Retention – In general, AbeApps Pte Ltd. will retain your PII for as long as you are a user of our products and thereafter for internal reporting and reconciliation purposes as necessitated by legal requirements and to provide you with any feedback or information you might request or require. After this time period we may delete orde-identify the information from our systems. Please note that if we remove your PII from our systems as described above, because we keep track of past transactions, we cannot delete information associated with those transactions. Additionally, it may be impossible to completely delete your information because of our data backup processes.
Security –We use administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect the information we maintain and ensure it is used in accordance to the terms of this policy. Our security controls are designed to restrict access to the information to authorized personnel only. We test our website for security vulnerabilities.
