Google offers an opt-out mechanism for the web available here.
In some of our apps, we create a video recording of some sessions. In parallel with that, a log of app activity is created and uploaded to the server, along with the user id used during the session. Each session is also provided with a rough location (country/district) at the time of use.

If you are under 13 years of age, then please do not use or access the service at any time or in any manner.

Data Security
How do we protect your data?
Enverus takes data security very seriously and we use industry-standard physical, technical, and administrative procedures. These measures include computer safeguards and secured files and buildings.
Our services use industry-standard Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption. All supplied sensitive and credit card information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our payment gateway provider’s database only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems and are required to keep the information confidential.
It’s important to stress, however, that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute security. If you have any questions about our security protocols, please email us at support@drillinginfo.com.
How can you improve your data security from side?
When logging into the Enverus website and apps, you should take every precaution to protect your own personal information, change your passwords often, use a combination of letters, numbers and symbols, and make sure you use a secure browser.
Sharing Data with Third Parties
Do we share your information with third parties?
We may share certain information, including your personal information, with third parties for the following reasons:
To help service providers assist in operating our business.
To comply with the law or in response to a subpoena, court order, government request, or other legal process.
To produce relevant documents or information in connection with litigation, arbitration, mediation, adjudication, government or internal investigations, or other legal or administrative proceedings.
To protect the interests, rights, safety, or property of Enverus or others.

We may disclose information about our users on an anonymized and aggregated basis to third parties, without restriction. Efforts will be made to assure that individual companies will not be recognizable in these aggregate statistics. We also reserve the right to use data where companies have given explicit permission.
What protections are provided by third parties with whom we share data information?
Enverus uses a limited number of third-party service providers to assist us in providing our services to customers. These third party providers offer customer support to our customers, perform database monitoring and other technical operations, assist with the transmission of data, and provide data storage services.
These third parties may access, process, or store personal data in the course of providing their services. Enverus maintains contracts with these third parties restricting their access, use and disclosure of personal data in compliance with our Privacy Shield obligations, including the onward transfer provisions, and Enverus remains liable if they fail to meet those obligations and we are responsible for the event giving rise to damage.
Do we source data from third parties?
Enverus obtains business contact and company information and other data from third party sources, such as business intelligence providers. The information obtained from these third parties is used to support Enverus’s marketing, sales, and business efforts.
What about information posted on blogs and other social media?
Our website and apps include social media links, such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn buttons. Please be aware that Enverus is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites or third parties. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personal information.
We also have a dynamic blog which is regularly updated. You should be aware that any information or comments you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from our blogs, contact us at support@drillinginfo.com.
Information Across Borders
Where is Enverus’s service hosted?
Enverus’s service is hosted in the United States and the United Kingdom. If you choose to use the service from Canada, the European Union, or other regions of the world with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that you are likely transferring your personal information outside of those regions to the United States for storage and processing.
What if my personal information is transferred to other countries? Do they have their own privacy policies and regulations?
Some of the uses and disclosures mentioned in this privacy policy may involve the transfer of your personal information to various countries around the world that may have different levels of privacy protection than the United States. By submitting your personal information through the Enverus website or apps, you consent to such transfers and to the processing of your personal information in such countries for the purposes described in this privacy policy.
** Are there international mechanisms?**
Yes. We comply with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks, designed by the U.S. Department of Commerce, and the European Commission and Swiss Administration, to provide companies with a mechanism to comply with data protection requirements when transferring personal data from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States in support of transatlantic commerce. We have certified to the Department of Commerce that we adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles of notice, choice, accountability for onward transfer, security, data integrity and purpose limitation, access, recourse, enforcement and liability.  If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.  To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/
In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, we commit to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal information. EU and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield policy should first contact us at support@drillinginfo.com. We commit to cooperate with EU data protection authorities (DPAs) and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) and comply with the advice given by such authorities with regard to human resources and non-human resources data transferred from the EU and Switzerland. In certain circumstances, the Privacy Shield Framework provides the right to invoke binding arbitration to resolve complaints not resolved by other means, as described in Annex I to the Privacy Shield Principles.
EU individuals and Swiss individuals have rights to access personal data about them, and to limit use and disclosure of their personal data. With our Privacy Shield self-certification, Enverus has committed to respect those rights. Because Enverus personnel have limited ability to access data our customers submit to our services, if you wish to request access, to limit use, or to limit disclosure, please provide the name of the Enverus customer who submitted your data to our services. We will refer your request to that customer, and will support them as needed in responding to your request.
Administrative Information About the Privacy Policy

Enverus is constantly reviewing its privacy policies in the light of ongoing regulations and user needs and issues. Enverus therefore reserves the right to modify this privacy policy at any time by posting the revised version on the Enverus web site and updating the effective date.
