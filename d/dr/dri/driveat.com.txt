DriveAt - Discover, Review, Share
DriveAt is an online application that helps people business listings and local services they can trust by accessing information, soliciting and aggregating reviews. To accomplish this, our users add business listings/places and write reviews about business listings and local services that are posted to the DriveAt Site. These listings and reviews can then be accessed and read by other DriveAt users. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, a "user" is defined as someone using the DriveAt Site, and a "friend" is defined as someone you have explicitly invited to share reviews with you. To fulfill the purpose of our site, we need to display a limited amount of personal information, so that users are able to evaluate the trustworthiness of a particular review. By using DriveAt, you permit the collection and use of your personal information as outlined below in our Privacy Policy. You should visit this page periodically to review any changes to the Privacy Policy.

Some information collected is not explicitly submitted by the user; we log your browser-type related information, IP address, requested URL, referring URL, and timestamp.
2. How We Use Your Information
Information such as your full name, profile photo and any personally identifiable information you have included in your reviews may be shown to friends or other users primarily in conjunction with reviews you have contributed.
