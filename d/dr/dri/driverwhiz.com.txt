telephone, and other personal information.
B. NPII – refers to information that does not in and of
itself allow us to identify a specific individual such as your “log
files” which tell us your IP address, which website your came from
before ours or go to after, which browser you use, your browser
language, the date and time of your requests, and the other similar
activities. NPII may be analyzed and/or compiled on an aggregate or
personal basis.

stores on your computer’s hard drive (if your web browser permits)
that can be later retrieved to identify you to us. Our cookies
consist of identification numbers only. We are able to look up
information about your preferences, origin, and other information

4. How our systems combine information and how we store, transfer, retain, and protect your information
Our Systems – All PII is recorded in our ecommerce system
and all NPII is stored in a separate tracking system. A user’s PII and
NPII are linked by way of the fact that their information in both
systems is categorized under the same unique identification number
(UID). Due to the shared UID number in these systems, all information
collected and stored in both systems is treated by 383 Media as PII.
However, neither system is able to use nor automatically access the
information stored in the other. Where the NPII collected is
disassociated from the UID, the information collected is treated as
NPII. Where such Mix Panel is a third party application utilized by
383 Media for the purpose of securely hosting Customer Relations
Management (CRM). 383 Media analyzes data collected on an aggregate
basis to optimize ecommerce flow and marketing campaigns.
Storage of Your Information – Information that we collect
may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country
in which we, our subsidiaries, affiliates, contractors,
representatives, agents, or resellers maintain such information. PII
on our servers is only accessible from our physical premises, premises
of our subsidiaries, affiliates, contractors, representatives, agents
and authenticated networks and personnel. Access is limited to
authorized personnel only, and company networks are password protected
and subject to additional policies and procedures for security. By
your use of our product you consent to any such transfer of
information outside of your country.
Data Transfer – Information may be transferred to the 383
Media group in the United States or other countries that may have less
protective data protection laws than the region in which you are
situated and be accessible by 383 Media employees or contractors
exclusively to be used in accordance with the purposes outlined in
this policy. For the same purposes the information may be shared with
partners and vendors that process information on behalf of 383 Media,
including, for instance, banking and credit card partners to process
payments made by you on our site. 383 Media has taken steps so that
the collected information, if transferred, receives an adequate level
of protection.
Data Retention – In general, 383 Media will retain your PII
for as long as you are a user of our products and thereafter for
internal reporting and reconciliation purposes as necessitated by
legal requirements and to provide you with any feedback or information
you might request or require. After this time period we may delete or
de-identify the information from our systems. Please note that if we
remove your PII from our systems as described above, because we keep
track of past transactions, we cannot delete information associated
with those transactions. Additionally, it may be impossible to
completely delete your information because of our data backup
processes
.
Security – We use administrative, technical, and physical
safeguards to protect the information we maintain and ensure it is
used in accordance to the terms of this policy. Our security controls
are designed to restrict access to the information to authorized
personnel only. We test our website for security vulnerabilities. When
you make payment on our websites using your credit card, we use SSL
encryption in the transmission to 383 Media of the credit card number.
5. How we share your information
We may share your PII with corporate affiliates to carry out
transactions you request, or to make our products, business or that of
our corporate affiliates more responsive to your needs which include our
corporate affiliates providing you with information about 383 Media, and
our products. We provide some of our services through contractual
arrangements with affiliates, service providers, partners, and other
third parties. For example, we must release your credit card information
to the card-issuing bank to confirm payment for products and provide
your order information to third parties who help us provide customer
service. Subject to applicable laws, 383 Media reserves the right to
cooperate with any legal process and any law enforcement or other
government inquiry related to your use of our product. This means that
383 Media will disclose your PII upon receipt of a court order,
subpoena, or to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation. We fully
cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our
product for illegal activities. We reserve the right to report to law
enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be
unlawful. Except as described above, we will not disclose your PII to
third parties for their own marketing purposes unless you have provided
consent.
6. Third-Party Websites and Services
Except as otherwise discussed in this policy, this document addresses
only the use and disclosure of information we collect about and from
you. We do not endorse, approve, or guarantee any third party sites or
products. Third party sites or products accessible through our
products have their own privacy policies, data collection, and use and
disclosure practices. Please also be aware that, in providing services
on 383 Media’s behalf, our business partners may collect personal
information about you. Please contact these third parties if you have
any questions as to their privacy practices. 383 Media shall not be
held liable for any damage or loss arising out of your interactions
with any third party.

contacting us through the contact information provided herein. We
encourage you to promptly update your PII if it changes. At this time

clicking on the unsubscribe link or following the instructions
provided within those emails or contacting us using the contact
information provided herein. If you choose to no longer receive
marking communications, 383 Media may still communicate with you
regarding such things as product updates and functionality, responses
to service requests or other transaction related communications. Any
marketing by 383 Media, or any third parties on behalf of 383 Media,
will be conducted in accordance with applicable laws. Please allow at
least 10 business days for your email preferences to take effect.
Because some promotions, such as direct mail catalogs, are developed
in advance, you may sometimes receive solicitations after we receive
your communication preference request.

collect, use or disclose personal information from children under the
age of 13 through our websites. If you are under 18 years of age or
