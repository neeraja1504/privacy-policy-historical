A Note To California Residents (Online Privacy Protection Act Of 2003 - OPPA)
It is the intent of the Privacy Policy to comply with the California Act. Various provisions throughout this Privacy Policy address requirements of the act. In summary, you must presume that we collect electronic information from all visitors. This is not usually personally identifiable. If you purchase a product or service via this website (and thereby become covered by the Act), the Terms of Service you electronically sign prior to purchase allows the website to collect and archive all the personal information you provide and to transmit and/or transfer that personal information to third parties. There is no way you can modify this information and you have no right to do so. Under the terms of the Terms of Service you have no right to view or receive any information about our database. In the event that the website, under advice of counsel agrees to divulge information, the requesting party must submit whatever information is demanded by the website in order to insure that the website is releasing information to the correct party. Other provisions of the OPPA may exempt this website from complying. While we take measures to ensure that outside parties do not have access to any information we have about you, we do not warranty that outside parties will not breach our system and thus have access to your information. (You should know that merchant service providers do not allow us access to your credit card information.)
We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy. If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, our Home page, and other places we deem appropriate. We will also notify You via the Software when changes have been made to this Privacy Policy, and other documents such as our EULA, Terms of Service, etc.
