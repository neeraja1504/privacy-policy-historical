Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but allow you to modify security settings so you can approve or reject cookies on a case-by-case basis. You need not have cookies turned on to visit this Site but doing so may ensure the most optimal customer experience while using the Site.
2.3. Use of Personal Information. Driscoll’s collects personal information from you, (such as your name, address, phone number, email address, etc.) only when you voluntarily provide it to us. This information may then be used to communicate with you regarding our products, services and promotions, solicit feedback via surveys, or provide you with information that you specifically requested. We will not send you unsolicited emails unless you have opted in for marketing communication or we are contacting you to follow-up on a specific request, issue, or communication you have initiated with us.
2.4. Sharing and Disclosing Your Information. Driscoll’s is not in the business of renting or selling personal information you provide on this Site to other people or nonaffiliated companies.

We provide information to trusted partners who work on our behalf or with Driscoll’s under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help Driscoll’s communicate with you about us. Examples of such arrangements include receiving your Customer Relation question or comment, sending and capturing survey questions and data or receiving a career applicant’s resume, application or other job related information or attachment. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information.
We may share your information to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process or to otherwise cooperate with law enforcement agencies or officials, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.
We may share your information if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to physical safety of any person, violations of Driscoll’s Terms of Use, or as otherwise required by law.
We may transfer information about you if Driscoll’s is acquired by or merged with another company.
