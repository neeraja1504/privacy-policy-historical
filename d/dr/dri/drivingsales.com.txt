We collect the following types of information about you:
Information you provide us directly:  We ask for certain information such as your username, first and last name, birth date, phone number and e-mail address when you register for a DrivingSales or DrivingSales Data account, or if you correspond with us.

We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Services.

A cookie may also convey information to us about how you use the Services (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on the Services), and allow us or our business partners to track your usage of the Services over time. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site.
