Privacy Policy
At drdavidwilliams.com it is quite important to us that we protect your privacy. When you place an online order with us, or register for our email communications, we collect your email address, land address, and sometimes telephone number. This information will be used by Healthy Directions, LLC for service, editorial, and marketing purposes. We will sometimes share your information with third party vendors who assist us with the preparation and mailing of our editorial and marketing communications, and with order fulfillment facilities. We will also occasionally provide your address to carefully-screened partners or third-party companies for the purpose of contacting you with news about relevant products or publications. We will never rent or sell your telephone or fax number to any third party.
The web sites maintained by Healthy Directions, LLC, including this one, may place a "cookie" in your computer's browser file. The cookie helps us recognize your browser and allows us to provide you with a more personal experience and better service when you visit our site. For example, cookies help us provide you with recommendations for information, products, or services that may be helpful to you, based on how you've browsed our site before. Cookies also help us keep track of products you've left in your shopping cart that you may wish to put on "hold" to purchase later. The cookie itself does not contain any of your personal information, so it does not jeopardize the privacy of your activities, or the security of the transactions you place at our site.
You should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose personal information (e.g., user name, email address) on the message boards or in the chat areas of this site, that information can be collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited messages from other message board posters or parties.
If we change or update this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by posting a notice in our free e-letters and on our website. These notices will allow you to easily link to and view the updated policy if you wish.
We sometimes make our customer list available to selected merchants whose products may be of interest to you. If you do not wish to receive these mailings or you do not want us to use your information for any marketing purposes, please write to:
