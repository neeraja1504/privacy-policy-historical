We allow you to restore your Cherry account with a grace period of 30 (thirty) calendar days from the moment you request deletion of your Cherry account.

After the grace period, Personal Data associated with your account will be deleted subject to section 4. above
In some cases, deletion of your Cherry account, and therefore Personal Data deletion, is complicated. Namely, if your account has a business relationship with Cherry Credits, such as due to your work for Cherry Credits or a game developer, you will only be able to delete your Cherry account after you have transferred this role to another user or have dissolved the business relationship. In some cases, considering the complexity and number of the requests, the period for Personal Data erasure may be extended, but for no longer than three further months.
