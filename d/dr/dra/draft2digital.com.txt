We may disclose your personal information to any of our affiliated entities, including parents, subsidiaries, successors, legal assigns, franchisees, or in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, bankruptcy or reorganization, financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.
Our strategic partners, vendors, or other service providers may need access to some of your personal information. In such cases, we only provide third party agents with the minimum amount of information needed to complete the requested service or transaction. When you purchase a service from our Site, you authorize D2D to share information with its strategic partners, vendors, or other service providers who are working on our behalf and need access to your information to carry out their work for us so that we may process and deliver to you the purchased service.

Information shared with such third parties is done securely and these third parties will have access to your information only as reasonably necessary to perform tasks on our behalf to provide you services through the Site and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes.
Non-personally identifiable user information (such as usage pattern, browser type and your computer) may be shared with third party businesses or advertisers with which we have a business or contractual relationship. We reserve the right to provide third parties with aggregate statistics about our clients, traffic patterns and related site information. This data reflects site usage patterns, but does not contain personally identifiable information about any individual user. Our vendors may provide us with sales information regarding publications distributed through our Site and services. Such information may indicate an author or contributor’s name for an individual publication, but does not include personal information such as tax ID, banking information, etc., and we may share such information with third party businesses or advertisers with which we have a business or contractual relationship.

Please keep in mind that if you disclose personally identifiable information in a public manner whether through collaborative postings, message boards or other public on-line forums, this information may be collected and used by others.

We are not responsible for the privacy statements, policies or content of other websites, including websites you link to or from our Site. Websites containing co-branding (referencing our name and a third party’s name) contain content delivered by the third party and not us.
We have implemented industry standard encryption and security solutions to protect our servers against intrusion. Access to our servers and users’ personal information by D2D employees is limited to a need-to-know basis. Sensitive information related to payment such as tax IDs and banking information is encrypted and stored on a separate server with no direct write-access. When you place orders on our site, your order information, including your card number and delivery address, is transmitted through the internet using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. SSL technology works with your browser to encrypt your order information before transmitting it to our processing facility.
The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to our Site. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Site.
Visitors to our Site may be given the opportunity to choose whether to have their information used for certain purposes at the point where we ask for the information. Visitors and users of the Site may also be sent messages concerning selected products, companies and/or events that we think may interest you. If you later decide you do not want to be contacted for such promotional purposes, please let us know through the opt-out procedures described in those communications or contact as at the contact information found at www.draft2digital.com/contact/ or by emailing us at support@draft2digital.com.

We may decline to process requests if we cannot verify the requestor's identity, if we believe the request will jeopardize the privacy of others, if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect, or for a similar legitimate purpose. In any case, where we provide information access, deletion or correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort.
If you choose to close your account or ask that we modify or delete some or all of your personal information, we will retain your personal data if reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations (including law enforcement requests), meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, maintain security, prevent fraud and abuse, enforce our Terms of Use or fulfill any others requests from you (for example, to opt-out of further messages or for a copy of your data)
We have no control of information you have shared with others through the Site after you close your account or asked to delete information or attempted to delete your account yourself. Your information and content you have shared may continue to be displayed in the services of others (for example, search engine results) until they refresh their cache.
