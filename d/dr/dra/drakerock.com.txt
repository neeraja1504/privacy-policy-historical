The only personally-identifying information we collect and store about you is the information you voluntarily choose to provide to us, such as your name, e-mail address, address, zip code, telephone number, etc., in response to a specific prompt that requires you to initially enter the information. In addition, we, our agents, affiliates, Third Party Program Participants and others may ask you to voluntarily provide additional personal information for billing, shipping and other similar purposes.
When a visitor, member, subscriber, or other Site user requests web pages from the Site's server, clicks on banners or other links or otherwise uses the Site's services or other functionalities, we or our agents may automatically collect some information or data about the user and the user's Site use, including the IP address from which the Site is being accessed, the pages or links that were requested, the special preferences or requests of the user and cookie information received from the computer of the user.

3. Cookies
We use cookies for your convenience. For example, we use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate and otherwise use our Site. Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored by a user's Web browser on the user's hard drive. Cookies can be used to "remember" what information a user accesses on one Web page to simplify subsequent interactions with that Web site by the same user or to use the information to streamline the user's transactions on related Web pages. This makes it easier for a user to move between and interact with Web pages and to complete commercial transactions over the Internet. The Site also uses cookies to store and sometimes track information to make your online experience easier and more personalized and for other purposes related to your use of the Site and related services. For example, because a cookie can be linked to information you have input or which has otherwise been collected, the need to repetitively enter certain information, such as your username or email address, can be eliminated. The use of cookies also assists us in acquiring important Site usage Data. Cookies can also assist us in tracking and targeting the interests, preferences and desires of our Site users to present the most appropriate messages, offers and other communications to our users, and to generally enhance their experience at our Site.
Currently, there are two general types of cookies commonly used in association with typical Web sites including our Site: "session" cookies and "persistent" cookies. A session or "session ID" cookie is functional only during the current "session" use of your browser, i.e., it ceases to function when you log off or close your browser. A "persistent" cookie remains on your hard drive beyond the current browser session. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "Help" file. We use both session cookies and persistent cookies.
We also use persistent cookies to track the actions of our users to enhance the experience on our site and to more effectively communicate Offers, promotional data and other useful information to you. At the present time, we intend to also adopt and use helpful future cookie technology, and similar types of technologies, as they become available. We may implement any and all such new technologies and similar improvements to Site functionality without notice.
We may also track special offers, promotions and other advertising delivered by us, and your responses to them, by using cookies. This helps us reduce the number of offers that might not be interesting to you. We also use cookies to help us credit persons who referred or introduced you to us.
The Site may also automatically collect traffic and click-through data as well as information regarding the online behavior of subscribers and other Site users by the use of cookies or other programming means. Any and all information about Site users collected by the Company, or its agents or affiliates via the Site or otherwise, through the use of cookies or other programming means may be freely included in our databases and used in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.
Some of our Third Party Program Participants, advertisers, agents and others use cookies on or in association with our Site. We have no access to or control over these cookies. We may also allow third-party service providers to deliver special offers or services to Site users and to control the use of their cookies on your computer. Since such providers may set, access, and otherwise control their cookies on your computer, we urge you to consult their privacy policies as they pertain to use of their cookies and the data collected from such use.
Most major Web browsers are set up so that they will initially accept cookies, but you may modify your computer's preferences to issue you an alert when a cookie is downloaded, or to disable the ability of third parties to download a cookie to you. If you choose to reject cookies, or disable your computer's ability to receive or process them, there are areas of this Site, other related web sites and related services that may not function properly. For example, you may not be able to view or interact with parts of the Site or access some of the services or offers otherwise available on the Site.
