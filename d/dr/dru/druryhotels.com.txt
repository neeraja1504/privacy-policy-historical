1. Information That We Collect
Drury collects Personal Information regarding its current, prospective and former guests, visitors, website visitors and other consumers (“Consumers”), travel and other business partners (“Business Partners”), and individuals who work for us including current, prospective and former employees, contractors and temporary and other seasonal workers (“Team Members”) based on the legal grounds and legitimate business purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy.
Drury collects Personal Information directly from Consumers, Business Partners, and Team Members and indirectly through third parties and Business Partners such as an online travel agencies, airline or other electronic travel reservation service, staffing agencies and recruiters, and other agencies and service providers. The types of Personal Information we may collect (directly from you or from third parties) and our privacy practices depend on the nature of the relationship you have with Drury and the requirements of applicable law.
We endeavor to collect Personal Information only relevant for the purposes of processing. Below are the legal bases and some of the ways we collect information and how we use it.
1.1 Information That You Provide
Drury collects Personal Information directly from you when you contact us to make a room reservation or stay at a hotel, buy a gift certificate, apply for a job, or create a personal profile through our Drury Rewards loyalty program or otherwise engage directly with us. You may choose to create a personal profile, to make it more convenient for you to do business with us or stay informed you about products and special offers that may be of interest to you. In addition, in certain circumstances and if you elect, you may include credit or debit card information in your profile, to be used for subsequent reservations to increase reservation speed and eliminate the need for you to repeatedly enter your credit card information.
We may collect other information about you, such as demographic information (for example, your age or gender), employer information (for example, travel agents and potential applicants), information about your preferences and interests (such as if you prefer a non-smoking room or tour packages) and your hotel-based activities (such as vehicle information, or use of hotel services). We may collect payment information (such as a credit or debit card number), if applicable. If we combine other information with Personal Information, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.
Drury may ask you to provide Personal Information about others. For example, may ask you to provide an employment reference or you may purchase a gift certificate or make a reservation for someone else, or we may allow you to forward information about our products, services, and hotels to another person. When you provide us with such information, you represent that you have gotten any necessary consent of the other person before disclosing their information to us, which we will use in accordance with the provisions of this Privacy Policy.
1.2 Information Third Parties Provide to Us About You
Drury may collect information about you from third party sources to provide the services you request or to supplement information provided by you.
For example, we may receive information about you from third parties, including without limitation airlines, travel agents and companies (for example, booking.com and expedia.com) and event planners. In addition, we may supplement the information we collect with outside records such as from your travel agent in order to provide you with information, services, or products you have requested, to tailor content, to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may interest you, and for other purposes, including marketing demographics. We may combine the information we receive from those other sources with information we collect. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to the combined information.
1.3 Research/Survey Solicitations
From time to time, Drury may perform research (online and offline) via surveys. We may engage third party-service providers to conduct such surveys on our behalf. All survey responses are voluntary, and the information collected will be used for research and reporting purposes to help us better serve you by learning more about your needs and the quality of the products and services we provide. The survey responses may be utilized to determine the effectiveness of our Site, various types of communications, advertising campaigns and/or promotional activities. We may share anonymous individual and aggregate data for research and analysis purposes.

We may also share such de-identified information we have collected with third-party advertising partners. These advertising partners may use this information (and similar information collected from other websites) for purposes of delivering targeted advertisements to you when you visit non-Drury related websites within their networks. This practice is commonly referred to as “interest-based advertising” or “online behavioral advertising.”
8. Choice and Ways You Can Opt Out
You have the right to opt out of certain uses and disclosures of your Personal Information, as set out in this Privacy Policy.
8.1 General
Where you have consented to Drury’s processing of your Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information, you may withdraw that consent at any time and opt out by following the instructions in this section.
Additionally, before we use Personal Information for any new purpose not originally authorized by you, we will provide information regarding the new purpose and give you the opportunity to opt out.
Prior to disclosing sensitive Personal Information to a third party or processing sensitive Personal Information for a purpose other than its original purpose or the purpose authorized subsequently by you Drury will endeavor to obtain your e explicit consent (opt-in). Where your consent for the processing of Personal Information is otherwise required by law or contract, Drury will comply with the law or contract.
8.2 Email and Telephone Communications
An “Unsubscribe” button will be provided at the top or bottom of each email communications sent by Drury so that you can opt-out. However, we may continue to send transaction-related emails regarding reservations, programs or services you have requested in response to such request. We may need to send you certain communications regarding the Drury programs and services and you will not be able to opt out of those communications – e.g., communications regarding updates to our Terms of Service or this Privacy Policy. We maintain telephone “do not call” lists and “do not mail” lists as mandated by law. We process requests to be placed on do not mail, do not phone and do not contact lists within 60 days after receipt, or such shorter time as may be required by law.
8.3 Human Resources Data

If Drury intends to use this Personal Information for any other purpose, Drury will provide the individual with an opportunity to opt-out of such uses.
8.4 “Do Not Track”
Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. Some Internet browsers may be configured to send “Do Not Track” signals to the online services that you visit. There is no consensus among industry participants as to what “Do Not Track” means in this context. Like many websites and online services, Drury does not alter its practices when it receives a “Do Not Track” signal from a visitor’s browser. To find out more about “Do Not Track,” please visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com.
8.5 Advertising Choices
We may use certain tools offered by third parties that enable such third parties to collect or receive information about actions users take on: (a) the Drury Site and elsewhere on the internet through use of cookies, pixel tags and other storage technologies; or (b) a Drury mobile application and other mobile applications, in order to provide interest-based advertising. Interest-based advertising is advertising that tries to make the ads you see more interesting and relevant to you based on the types of sites you visit online and other information that does not personally identify you. Advertisements on Third-Party websites that contain the AdChoices link and that link to this Privacy Policy may have been directed to you based on anonymous, non-Personal Information collected by advertising partners over time and across websites. These advertisements provide a mechanism to opt-out of the advertising partners’ use of this information for interest-based advertising purposes. You can opt out of the collection and use of your information for interest-based advertising by going to http://optout.aboutads.info or http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/ to limit collection through the Drury Site or by configuring the settings on your mobile device to limit ad tracking through the mobile applications. Even if you opt-out, we may still collect and use non-Personal Information regarding your activities on our Websites and/or information from the advertisements on third-party websites for non-interest based advertising purposes, such as to determine the effectiveness of the advertisements.
9. How and When We Disclose Information to Third Parties
In addition to receiving your Personal Information from third parties, Drury may so share or disclose the Personal and non-Personal information we collect or receive. Drury endeavors to require third parties to which it discloses Personal Information to protect Personal Information using substantially-similar standards to those required by Drury and to notify Drury if they make a determination that they can no longer meet this obligation.
We may share the information we have collected about you (including Personal Information): (i) as disclosed at the time you provide your information, (ii) with your consent, (iii) as described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, or (iv) in any of the following circumstances:
9.1 Provide You Services

9.3 When You Agree to Receive Information from Third Parties or Request That We Share Your Information
You may be presented with an opportunity to receive information and/or marketing offers from one or more third parties. If you agree at that time to have your Personal Information shared (by opting in or choosing not to opt out at that time), your Personal Information will be disclosed to that third party (or parties) and will be subject to the privacy policy and practices of that third party. If you later decide that you no longer want to receive communications from a third party, you will need to contact that third party directly. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of third parties.
9.4 Administrative and Legal Reasons
We reserve the right to disclose any information (including Personal Information) if we believe such action is necessary: (i) to conform to legal requirements, to comply with legal process or a subpoena, or at the request of a governmental entity conducting an investigation; (ii) to collect amounts owed to Drury (iii) to enforce Drury policies or contracts or protect and defend the legal rights or property of Drury, our Consumers, Partners, the Drury Site or its users, or any other party; (iii) if we in good faith believe that such action is permitted by law; or (iv) in an emergency, to protect the health and safety of our Consumers, Partners, users or the general public. In addition, from time to time, server logs may be reviewed for security purposes – e.g., to detect unauthorized activity on the Site. In such cases, server log data containing IP addresses may be shared with law enforcement bodies in order that they may identify users in connection with their investigation of the unauthorized activities.
9.5 Business Transfers & Transitions
Drury may share your information, including Personal Information, with its parent, subsidiaries, and affiliates, primarily for business and operational purposes. In the event Drury goes through a business transition (such as a merger, acquisition by another company, bankruptcy or sale of all or a portion of its assets, including, without limitation, during the course of any due diligence process), your Personal Information will likely be among the assets transferred. By providing your Personal Information, you agree that we may transfer such information to the acquiring entity without your further consent.
9.6 Sweepstakes, Contests, & Promotions
We may offer sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions (any, a “Promotion”) that may require registration. By participating in a Promotion, you are agreeing to the provisions, conditions or official rules that govern that Promotion, which may contain specific requirements of you (including, except where prohibited by law, allowing the sponsor(s) of the Promotion to use your name, voice, likeness or other indicia of persona in advertising or marketing materials). If you choose to enter a Promotion, Personal Information may be disclosed to third parties or the public in connection with the administration of such Promotion, including, without limitation, in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment, and as required by law or permitted by the Promotion's official rules (such as on a winners list).

You may view, update, delete, and/or edit the registration data you have provided to Drury by logging in to your account and going to “My Profile” section, and following the appropriate instructions.
At any time you may seek confirmation regarding whether Drury is Processing Personal Information about you, request access to Personal Information, and ask to receive (port), amend or delete your Personal Information where it is inaccurate by calling 1-888-324-1851. Drury will make good faith efforts to implement requested changes in our active databases. Note, however, that we may keep information you update or change for Drury’s administrative purposes. Also, it is not always possible to completely remove or delete all of your information from our databases, and such requests will be processed in line with local laws.
Although Drury makes good faith efforts to provide Individuals with access to their Personal Information, there may be circumstances in which Drury is unable to provide access, including but not limited to: where the information contains legal privilege, would compromise others’ privacy or other legitimate rights, where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the individual’s privacy in the case in question or where it is commercially proprietary. If Drury determines that access should be restricted in any particular instance, we will provide you with an explanation of why that determination has been made and a contact point for any further inquiries. To protect your privacy, Drury will take commercially reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access to or making any changes to your Personal Information.
11. Retention
Drury retains the Personal Information we receive as described in this Privacy Policy for as long as you use our Website(s)s or as necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected, provide our products and services, resolve disputes, establish legal defenses, conduct audits, pursue legitimate business purposes, enforce our agreements and comply with applicable laws.
12. Protection of Personal Information by Drury

Drury does not knowingly solicit or collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13 (and in certain jurisdictions under the age of 16).

If you are under the age of 13 (and in certain jurisdictions under the age of 16), please do not submit any Personal Information to Drury.
If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child under the age of 13 (and in certain jurisdictions under the age of 16), has directly provided us with Personal Information without his or her consent, he or she should contact us and we will delete such information from our files.
14.2 Third-Party Links and Content
Please note that Drury Website(s) may contain links to other websites, including to our Drury branded credit card partners, for your convenience and information. Drury does not control these third-party websites or their privacy practices, which may differ from those set out in this Privacy Policy. Drury is not responsible for the privacy practices of third party sites and does not endorse or make any representations about the third-parties website privacy practices. Any Personal Information you choose to give to unrelated third parties is not covered by this Privacy Policy. Drury encourages you to review the privacy policy of any company or website before submitting your Personal Information. Some third parties may choose to share their users’ Personal Information with Drury; that sharing is governed by that company’s privacy policy, not this Privacy Policy.

14.5 California Residents
Your California Privacy Rights: Pursuant to California Civil Code Section 1798.83, residents of the State of California have the right to request from companies conducting business in California certain information relating to third parties to which the company has disclosed certain categories of Personal Information during the preceding year for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that a company may comply, as Drury does, by disclosing in its privacy policy that it provides consumers choice (opt-out or opt-in) regarding sharing Personal Information with third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes, and information on how to exercise that choice. As stated above in this Privacy Policy, Drury provides you with a choice prior to sharing your Personal Information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. If you do not opt-in or if you choose to opt-out at the time Drury offers that choice, Drury does not share your information with that identified third party for its direct marketing purposes.
If you are a California resident and you have questions about our practices with respect to sharing information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes and your ability to exercise choice, please send your request by email to legal@druryhotels.com or write to us at: 721 Emerson Road, Suite 400, St. Louis, MO 63141 Attn: Legal Department. You must put the statement “Your California Privacy Rights” in the subject field of your email or include it in your writing if you choose to write to us at the designated mailing address. You must include your name, street address, city, state, and ZIP code. We are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or do not have complete information.
