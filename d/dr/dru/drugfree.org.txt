Privacy Policy
Privacy Assurance
We will not willfully disclose any individually identifiable information about you to any outside source without your express consent.
The Partnership for Drug-Free Kids is committed to protecting the personal information you choose to share with us. Below you will find our privacy assurance and some additional information about how we gather information about our registered users, why we gather it and what we do with it. Please see Terms of Use for more information about the use of the Partnership for Drug-Free Kids website.
How does the Partnership for Drug-Free Kids use cookies?
The Partnership for Drug-Free Kids uses cookies to facilitate the login process for you to access sections that require registration to post or contribute to the site. When you register in these sections, we assign a unique user ID to you and we place a cookie on your computer, which will remind our system of that USER ID the next time you visit the site. This cookie allows you to access the areas of the site that require registration without having to log on multiple times. If you choose to log out, the cookie we set in registration will be deleted and we will then set another cookie like it on your computer next time you log in.
Please note: Nothing in a cookie allows anyone to identify you individually. Your computer is assigned a number and that number is tracked using the cookie. This number is only meaningful in the context of our secure database system and your personalized version of the Partnership for Drug-Free Kids website.
What information do we gather?
The only individually identifiable information that we collect about you is that which you provide to us through registration and submission forms, polls and surveys that you choose to fill out. This information will be closely protected and used for internal purposes only. We will never willfully release your personal information to any third party other than vendors who provide us with web and other technology services (see more about third party vendors under “Registrant Donor Database” below.)
We also collect information about aggregate site usage. Statistics that we gather about unique visits, repeat visits and page views are all based on IP address, not on your individual activities.
Donating to the Partnership for Drug-Free Kids:
When you donate to the Partnership for Drug-Free Kids online you submit confidential credit card information, contact information, and acknowledge whether you would like to be contacted by the Partnership for Drug-Free Kids via email in the future. We recognize the importance of respecting the integrity of this material and limit access only to personnel authorized to process your request.
You may also choose to make a donation in memory of someone or in honor/tribute of someone in recovery. When you make a donation of this type, the amount of your gift is shown only on your receipt. The person or family you designate will receive an acknowledgment e-card or regular-mail card in your name if you choose to send one. We collect this additional contact information in order to honor your request to send an acknowledgement. The information is not used for any direct mail or email databases or solicitations, nor is it shared with any third parties. Email-communications from the Partnership for Drug-Free Kids are only issued through the direct consent of each unique visitor (known as “opting in”).
Online donors are also offered the option of choosing to let the Partnership for Drug-Free Kids contact them via email in the future.
Registrant and Donor Database

Stories: Personal Stories, Recovery Stories and Memorial Stories
Many visitors to our site have stories to share about their experiences, or experiences of their friends and family, with substance abuse, recovery, treatment, prevention, etc. We created the “Stories” sections to enable visitors to submit a personal story for possible posting to our site.  Submitting gender, age range, ethnic background, city and state is optional. When you share a story to this section, an email address is required in case we need to contact you. By submitting a story, you automatically give us permission to post the story on our website. The Partnership for Drug-Free Kids reserves the right to edit the story for publication. Your email address will not be published, and your email address will not be shared with any outside organizations or individuals. Please review our Terms of Use for more information.

The Partnership for Drug-Free Kids reserves the right to terminate your account if it learns that you have provided false or misleading registration information.
eNewsletter Sign-up
We use Blackbaud, Inc. for email communication. Our eNewsletter sign-up section requires you to enter your email address to sign up for email newsletters. When you choose to sign up for one of our email newsletters, your email address is used solely to provide the newsletter to which you subscribe. Your email address won’t be shared with any outside organizations or individuals without your express permission. Whenever you do receive a mailing from us you will always find an easy method to unsubscribe within the contents of the email.
Online Surveys
Our occasional online surveys ask visitors for contact information (like email or mailing address). We use contact data from our surveys to send the user information about the Partnership for Drug-Free Kids and its activities. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings (see the Choice/Opt-out section below). Other data collected by online surveys is used to educate the Partnership for Drug-Free Kids about the interests and concerns of its supporters and general site visitors concerning the Partnership for Drug-Free Kids mission, programs and events. This information is not shared with other organizations. The Partnership for Drug-Free Kids operates email discussion and contact lists to reach its members who request such information. Such services are run both by the Partnership for Drug-Free Kids and contracted vendors. These email addresses, whether housed on the Partnership for Drug-Free Kids servers or those of our third-party contractor, are never shared with any other organization and users may opt out of participating or receiving email information from the Partnership for Drug-Free Kids at any time. Instructions are contained within each email sent.
“Tell-A-Friend,” “Email Others”, “Tell Others”
If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, programs or events, we ask them for the friend’s name and email address. The Partnership for Drug-Free Kids will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site to learn about the feature, program or event. The Partnership for Drug-Free Kids stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. The friend may contact the Partnership for Drug-Free Kids at webmaster@drugfree.org to request the removal of this information from the database.
Security
This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. This includes a firewall and 24 monitoring of site activities by our hosting service provider as well as 128-bit SSL encryption (where allowable by law) on all transaction oriented operations between you and the Partnership for Drug-Free Kids via our transaction service provider. While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to your information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers’ information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store identifiable personal information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage.
Contact Information
Please contact us if you have any questions, concerns, or comments about our privacy policies or practices so we can address them: (212) 315-8799 or email us at webmaster@drugfree.org.
