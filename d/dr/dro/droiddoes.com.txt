Privacy Policies | Verizon
At Verizon, we are committed to maintaining strong and meaningful privacy protections for customers. Our privacy policy is designed to inform you about the information we collect, how we use it, and your options about certain uses of information.
Verizon's privacy policy applies to website visitors and customers of the Verizon family of companies in the United States. Additional privacy practices that apply to Fios, Verizon Wireless, AOL and hum services are also described in the full policy. Supplemental privacy policies for AOL companies and the services they provide are described in the AOL privacy policy. In the event of a conflict between the Verizon privacy policy and the AOL privacy policy, the AOL policy will control when you are on an AOL site or using an AOL product or service.
Below, we've summarized key elements from our full privacy policy for your convenience.
Information we collect and how it is used
Verizon collects and uses information about our customers and website visitors when you interact with us, when you use our products and services, and when you visit our websites. This information is used to deliver, provide and repair products or services; establish and maintain customer accounts and billing records; contact you about our products and services and direct offers or promotions to you; monitor website statistics; and manage and protect our networks. Information may also be aggregated or de-identified for business and marketing uses by us or by third parties.
We may also obtain consumer information from outside companies who provide such data. We use this data and combine it with other information we have to help us analyze customer information, predict customer preferences and direct marketing offers. Learn more.
Information provided to or used by third-party advertisers
You may see third-party advertisements on some Verizon websites, services or devices. In some instances, advertisers seek to provide advertising that may be more relevant to your interests. They do this, for example, by placing cookies on your browser and using them to collect information about your visit on our websites. They may combine this information with similar information obtained from other websites.
We also may provide third-party advertisers with the ability to target their ads using certain information about customers. This information does not identify you individually. You have choices and may limit the use of your information. Learn more.
Information shared
Verizon shares customer information within our family of companies. You can limit our sharing of certain types of customer information, known as Customer Proprietary Network Information, for certain marketing uses.
Except as explained in our Privacy Policy, in privacy policies for specific services, or in agreements with our customers, Verizon does not sell, license or share information that individually identifies our customers with others outside of Verizon who are not doing work on Verizonâ€˜s behalf without your consent. We may share information with our vendors and partners for business purposes and when necessary for them to perform work on our behalf.
