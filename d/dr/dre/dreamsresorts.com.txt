Policy and guidelines for use of marks in advertising, promotion and display
AMRESORTS and its affiliates have the exclusive rights to use the AMRESORTS service mark and other AMRESORTS marks and logos. Under the trademark laws, the AMRESORTS companies must prevent the use of their names and marks in ways that could give customers and potential customers the mistaken impression that an AMRESORTS company owns or is affiliated with an agency using its marks. AMRESORTS (and trademark law) allow the "fair use" of AMRESORTS marks and logos by agencies, in a truthful, informational way in accordance with the rules provided here. Please adhere to the following specific rules when using AMRESORTS names and marks in promotions on Internet web sites and in print advertisements.
General Rules
All uses of the AMRESORTS name or any AMRESORTS mark must relate solely to AMRESORTS travel packages and not to the agencies selling them. Agencies that sell AMRESORTS packages may not refer to themselves in any context as "AMRESORTS travel agents" or to their businesses as "official AMRESORTS travel agencies."
Travel agencies may only use signage, window displays, or point of purchase items employing the AMRESORTS name or any AMRESORTS mark (a) as provided by AMRESORTS, or (b) as approved in writing by AMRESORTS.
No one may copy any content appearing in any AMRESORTS website, brochure, or advertising without express written permission from AMRESORTS.
AMRESORTS marks should be used with the ® symbol, and the use should be accompanied by a legend appearing at the bottom of the page where used that the mark is registered; for example, AMRESORTS is a registered trademark.
