Cookies are files that can identify you as a unique customer and store your personal preferences as well as technical information (including click through and click stream data). Cookies can either be permanent (i.e., they remain on your computer until you delete them) or temporary (i.e., they last only until you close your browser).
How Site Uses Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies
We send “cookies” to your computer primarily to enhance your online experience. For example, we may use cookies to:
store visitors’ preferences;
record session information;
record user-specific information, such as information on what pages users access or visit;
alert visitors to new areas that we think might be of interest to them;

ensure that visitors are not repeatedly sent the same banner ads, if any;
customize Site content based on a visitor’s browser type or other information that the visitor sends.
We may also use “web beacons” that monitor your use of our Site. Web beacons are small strings of code that provide a method for delivering a graphic image on a web page for the purpose of transferring data, such as the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the web beacon appears, the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) of the page on which the web beacon appears, the time the page containing the web beacon was viewed, the types of browser that fetched the web beacon and the identification number of any cookie on the computer previously placed by that server. When corresponding with you via HTML capable e-mail, web beacons let us know whether you received and opened our e-mail.
How To Disable Cookies
You may adjust your browser to reject cookies from us or from any other web site. Additionally, by setting your web browser to display HTML e-mails as text only, you may be able to prevent the use of some web beacons. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information.

Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information
We do not sell or rent your personally identifiable information. However, we may share your personally identifiable information and any information about the content you post to the Site, submit as part of your profile or otherwise share with us (collectively “your information”), with DBI subsidiaries and affiliates who may use the information for marketing, advertising, research and other purposes.
We may also share your information with third party service providers and contractors of DBI who perform services on our behalf. Third-party agents and contractors of DBI who have access to personally identifiable information are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy by, for example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for DBI.
Notwithstanding the above, if you choose to post content on our Site (e.g., a dream), we may freely disclose to others that content and any other information you have agreed to allow us to disclose to third parties based on your account settings. You should note that if the content you post on our Site (e.g., a dream) contains names or other personally identifiable information about you or another person, that information will be disclosed to others in accordance with your account settings. For example, if you choose to share your dreams, any visitor to the Site, whether a registered user or not, will be able to view your dreams and any information it contains. You should keep this in mind when deciding what information to include in the dreams and other content you post to the Site and when setting your account settings.
We may also disclose your information in response to legal process. For example, we may disclose personally identifiable information about you in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose your information in response to a law enforcement agency’s request or where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our terms of use, or as otherwise required by law. In addition, we may transfer your information if we are acquired by or merged with another company or if our assets are acquired by another entity.
In addition, we may disclose non-personally identifying demographic information and aggregate information about Site users with third parties, including marketers and advertisers.

Our Commitment To Security
We have put in place commercially reasonable physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and use the information we collect online as provided in this Privacy Policy.
Despite these precautions, however, no data security safeguards are foolproof. Identity thieves, hackers and other unauthorized individuals may find ways to obtain Personal Data. Although this is unlikely, if Company learns that any of your personally identifiable information was obtained without authorization and there is a risk of fraud or identity theft, we will notify you and take steps to mitigate any harm.
Notice Regarding Changes to this Privacy Policy
From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice. If our information practices change at some time in the future we will post the policy changes to our website to notify you of these changes, together with a new date at the top of the Privacy Policy. If those changes are material, we will give you the chance to opt out of those changes with regard to information collected under previous versions of this privacy policy.
We encourage you to check back to this Privacy Policy periodically and review the effective date at the top of the Privacy Policy to see if the Privacy Policy has changed, so that you always will know what information we collect, how we use it, and to whom we disclose it.
