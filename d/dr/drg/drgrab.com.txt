We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future shopping for you, improving our stores, and communicating with you. We always try to personalize and continually improve your DrGrab shopping experience.
Please note that use of the Website by you is subject to this privacy policy (the "Policy") and the Website’s terms and conditions of use ("Terms and Conditions"). In this Policy a word/term used with a capital letter, is defined in the Terms and Conditions or elsewhere in this Policy.
Our Policy explains what information we collect on the Website, how we use and/or share this information, and how such information is maintained by us. By using this Website, you signify your acceptance of this Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Policy, in whole or part, you should not use this Website. Please note that this Policy applies only with regard to the information collected on the Website and not any information collected or obtained through other methods or sources.
Our Policy ensures that any information you provide us remains private and secure. To reassure you, below we provide details of the information you provide to us, and how it will and, more importantly, will not be used. We will never collect sensitive information about you without your explicit consent. The information we hold will be accurate and up to date. You can check the information that we hold about you by contacting us (and there may be an administrative fee payable for this). If you find any inaccuracies we will delete or correct it promptly.
2. Personally Identifiable Information - Collection of PII that we collect
We collect personally identifiable information ("PII") that is volunteered during Registration or in response to specific information requests explicitly presented to you.
We may also collect your IP (Internet Protocol) address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer this Website. An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. Your IP address is also used to help identify you during a particular session and to gather broad demographic data.
We may ask for your e-mail address during your use of the Website. Also, to purchase Vouchers you may be requested to provide any or all of the following PII: first and last name, postal address, e-mail address, date of birth, telephone number and details of a payment mechanism, such as credit card details.
3. Use and Sharing of PII
All PII is retained in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998 and other applicable data protection laws in Australia.
We use PII to provide you with information about DrGrab, to properly provide you with the Service and for marketing ourselves to you. It is our policy not to sell or pass any PII to any third party organisations (outside our group companies) unless we are required to do so for fraud prevention and detection. We will never sell or rent your PII to anyone else for their marketing or any other commercial purposes without your prior consent.
However, we may pass your PII to our agents and subcontractors to help us with any of our uses of your data set out in this Policy. For example, we may use third parties to provide us with marketing or customer service assistance or send it to a credit card provider to process a payment.
We also always reserve the right to disclose PII in order to:
(a) comply with applicable laws;
(b) respond to governmental enquiries (or enquiries from a legal, governmental or quasi-governmental or local authority agency or Internet protection agency of any type);
(c) comply with a valid legal process or procedure;
(d) protect our rights or property, this Website, and/or other users of this Website.
Please note that as part of any PII sharing which we list above, we may send your information internationally including to countries outside the European Economic Area. Some places outside of the EEA may not have adequate data protection laws at all or may offer differing levels of protection of personal information which are not as high as in Australia. By submitting PII to us, you acknowledge that provided we have used your data in the ways set out in this Policy, we cannot be held responsible for any use of your data by third parties who receive and process your data.
