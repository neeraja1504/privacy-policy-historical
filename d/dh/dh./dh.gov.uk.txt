These policies will explain how they collect and use your personal information, and whether they pass this on to websites they link you to.
Social networking websites
The Department of Health website has buttons at the bottom of website pages so you can use social networking websites (eg Facebook and Twitter) with the DH website. These websites are not controlled by DH. By using these buttons you accept the privacy policies of these websites.
Social bookmarking
Social bookmarks are a way of saving links to web pages that interest you, and sharing those links with other people.
Social bookmarking websites are free to use, but you will need to register with them to start bookmarking.
To use a social bookmarking website, you need to:
register with a social bookmarking website
find a web page you like
save the link to the social bookmarking website, which stores it
add words or ‘tags’ to the link to explain what the page is about
You can then visit the social bookmarking website whenever and from wherever you want, and view the bookmarked links you have saved or shared. You will also be able to look at other people’s bookmarks and comments, and they will be able to view yours.
Social bookmarking websites all work in different ways and you may prefer to use one or many. It’s worth having a look at the different websites before you decide which one you want to use. You can register with as many as you like.
The social media and social bookmarking services that DH links to are third party websites. DH does not have any control over the way that these websites use your data.

analysing anonymised data to help us understand how people interact with govt services so we can make them better
