Privacy Policy | DSMtuners
What we collect
DSMtuners collects personal information from you when you register to participate, enter a contest, or complete a survey on our website. Personal information consists of your email address, first name, last name, and password. In some rare cases, like for contests, we'll ask for street address and zip code - none of this information is saved on our servers or shared with third parties. If you enter a sweepstakes, contest or survey we may also ask you for some demographic information such as your age or income range. Other information collected may include your IP address, browser type and operating system.
How we use this info
The information collected is used for administration purposes and to help improve the services we provide. This information will not be sold, rented or disclosed in any way to outside parties unless required to do so by law. We also may disclose aggregated information (for example, X number of our viewers visit the Gallery section) to third parties.
Use of cookies
We set and access cookies on your computer each time you access our website. These cookies are used to determine whether you have been to our website before, to automatically store your password, and to ensure the efficient use of ad banner rotation. DSMtuners uses third party ad servers and advertisers who also use cookie information and technology. For more information on cookies and privacy, visit the National Advertising Initiative (NAI) cookie identification website at: http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices
Receiving Email from us
We occasionally send out email to our members to announce site news and updates (no more than once per month). This email only goes out to those who have chosen to receive email from our website administrators. If you no longer wish to receive news or updates, you can change this option setting in your profile. You can also adjust your settings to not receive emails from other others through our website if you like. Allowing other members to email you does not mean your email address is visible to anyone. Only if you reply to an email sent from a member of the website through our system will that member be able to view your email address.
This policy is subject to change, so please check back periodically. Direct all questions regarding this policy to the webmaster.
