Privacy Policy – www.dsogaming.com
What information we collect
To prevent abuse and enhance the features of our site, we collect non-personal information such as the IP (internet provider). Sometimes, we may store a file called a cookie on your computer. These non-malicious files are set to delete themselves within a short period of time (usually one day). They are used by us to help our advertisers target their traffic. A cookie may also be saved on your computer by our ad providers (ValueForClick, and Google Adsense) when you click an ad. This is saved on your computer so the advertisers can tell that you’ve already clicked an ad. This saves our advertisers from paying for double and fraudulent clicks.
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our DSOGaming.com. These companies may use information (not including your name, address email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click here.

The information we collect is only the information which is necessary. No personally identifiable information (such as your phone number, address, name etc) is ever collected unless you have willingly submitted it such as through registration.
Sites like DSOGaming  use cookies, files which stay on your PC, and you can turn that feature off in your browser if you’re not comfortable with it. There are 3rd-party adverts on this site, and they often collate traffic data and use cookies. You can block their tracking with systems like this one, or any number of other cookie blockers available on the web, such as Spybot.
