Privacy Commitments
Dynamic Search takes your privacy very seriously. Our customers told us they want to see clear, easy-to-read information about our privacy commitments and policy.

Our privacy commitments are fundamental to the way we do business every day. These apply to everyone who has a relationship with Dynamic Search — including customers and site visitors.
We will protect your privacy and keep your personal information safe. We use powerful encryption and other security safeguards to protect customer data, including your credit cards information which we may store.
We will not sell your personal information to anyone, for any purpose.
Our customers are in control and you can change, delete or cancel your listing at anytime.
You can send us questions or feedback on our privacy policy by emailing legal@dynamicsearch.com.au

Maintenance, Updates And Site Changes
Our mission is to build Australia’s leading business directory. To enable this we must continue to introduce new facilities, services and features to the website.
