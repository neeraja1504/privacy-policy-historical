Privacy Policy (DT4)
DYMO's Privacy and Security Policy
This site has been designed with your privacy, security and convenience in mind.
You're in control of how your information is used:
We will not rent or sell your name or personal information to any third party.
You will be notified of any substantial changes to our policy:
Since offerings and technologies change, we reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add or remove portions of this policy at any time.
Some of our sites include an ordering system, enabling you to purchase products from one of our subsidiaries, dealers, or other third parties. In the case of dealers or other third parties we will only provide them with your name, address and other non-financial information to help them to serve you.
Our sites have the ability to store information to save you from having to re-enter it on a subsequent visit to that site. Financial information such as credit card details that you enter whilst ordering from an Esselte subsidiary are not stored on our web servers after your order has been processed.
If you have set up an account with us or entered personal information including your email address (eg. when entering one of our contests), we may occasionally update you via e-mail of special opportunities. If you would rather not be alerted to such opportunities, you have the ability to opt out by editing your account details to say so, or by replying to the email with an 'unsubscribe' command.
Other sites (outside of www.dymo.com) to which this site is linked have a similar policy, but you should check their policy statements before supplying further personal information on their site. Other resellers listed in our dealer locator systems may operate web sites with a different policy to this site. You should always check their policy statements carefully before supplying them with any personal information.
We may share statistical or demographic information with our marketing partners, advertisers, or other third-parties. This information is in the form of statistics or purchase demographics and is never connected to an individual person.
If you detect any inaccuracy in your account or personal information, we will be happy to make any changes you deem appropriate.
You will be notified of any substantial changes to our policy
Since offerings and technologies change, we reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of our policy at any time. If policy changes are substantial, we will notify each of our customers individually through e-mail, and provide an opportunity to delete or amend account details. Please check back here for changes.
