Privacy & Security
Design Within Reach is committed to respecting your privacy. We use the information we collect about you to process orders and to provide a more personalized shopping experience. We will not sell or disclose any information that identifies you to a third party if requested. In addition, when you place an order with Design Within Reach your personal information and credit card information are safe. Please read on for more details about our privacy policy.
What information does Design Within Reach collect?
When making a purchase through our Site, we collect your name, billing address, phone number, e-mail address and credit card information, in order to process your order. Therefore when you visit our Site to place subsequent orders we can save you time by providing your previous account information for you. If you request a catalog, we collect your name, mailing address and e-mail address. Once we have collected an email address, we send our weekly email newsletter informing you of news and our special product offers. You are welcome to visit our Site without providing any of this information; however, we are unable to process an order or send a catalog or newsletter without the requested information.
We use cookies, which is a feature of your browser used to assign identification to your computer. The unique user ID contained within your cookie automatically identifies your computer – but not you – to our servers every time you visit our site. Cookies by themselves cannot be used to find out the identity of any user, but may be correlated with identity information in our log files. You can decline cookies through your browser preference options, but you may not be able to use some of our services properly as a result, such as the option to save your user name and password.
We also collect the IP address of visitors to our Site and collect aggregate information about the use of our Site. All information described in this section entitled "What information does Design Within Reach collect?" constitutes "Data" for purposes of this Privacy Policy.
Design Within Reach may collect your email address via cookies and pixels on the Website through the use of trusted third party partners. These partners may also combine your email information with other information they have access to such as mailing address so that Design Within Reach may serve relevant marketing offers to you via email and direct mail. If you do not want Design Within Reach to collect information about you, please contact us to opt out.
