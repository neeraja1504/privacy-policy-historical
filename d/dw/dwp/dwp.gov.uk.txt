Cookies
We want our services to be easy, useful and reliable. For services delivered on the internet, this sometimes involves placing small amounts of information on your device, for example, computer or mobile phone. These small files are known as cookies. They cannot be used to identify you personally.
These pieces of information are used to improve services by, for example:
enabling a service to recognise your device so you don't have to give the same information several times during one task
recognising that you may already have given a username and password so you don't need to do it for every web page requested
measuring how many people are using services, so they can be made easier to use and there's enough capacity to ensure they are fast.
If you delete cookies or you set your browser not to accept cookies, you will not be able to use some of our services.
On this website we only use cookies that do not collect personal information.
How we use cookies
You can manage cookies yourself and learn more about them on GOV.UK.
