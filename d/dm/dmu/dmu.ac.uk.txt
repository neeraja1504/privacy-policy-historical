Data protection and privacy laws
The main laws are the Data Protection Act 2018 and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).  We also adhere to the duty of confidence and the Human Rights Act (Article 8).
For electronic communications, including email and cookies, we comply with the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR).
Sensitive information
The GDPR defines some types of information as special category data because it is more sensitive. We must have an additional lawful basis to process special category data.
For educational purposes:
The lawful basis we rely on is ‘substantial public interest on the basis of union or member state law’.
For academic research:
All our research is done in the public interest, therefore, where our research involves special category data, we will rely on one of the public interest lawful bases to process special category data, in addition to the lawful basis of ‘public task’ for general processing.
For some courses, we need to know about criminal offences (including spent convictions) because the course includes a placement working directly with children or vulnerable adults.  We will comply with Schedule 1 of the Data Protection Act 2018 and the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act (Exceptions) Order 1975.
Your rights
The GDPR gives you rights over how your personal information is used:
The right to be informed - we must tell you how we process your personal information.
The right of access - you can ask to see what personal information we hold about you. This is called a Subject Access Request (SAR).
The right of rectification - where information about you is inaccurate, you can ask us to correct it.
The right to erasure – in some circumstances, or where DMU has no compelling reason to retain your personal information, you can request deletion of that information.
The right to restrict processing – in some circumstances, you can ask us to restrict the processing of your personal data. This right, where it applies, also allows you to ask us to retain your personal information but not to use it.
The right to data portability – in some circumstances, you can request a copy of the personal data you have provided to us in a machine-readable form, so you can transfer it to another organisation for a similar purpose.
Right to object – where there is no legal obligation for DMU to process your data, you can object to us processing your personal information.
Rights in relation to automated decisions and profiling - where computers make decisions about you, including automated profiling, you have a right to challenge the decision or ask for a human to check an automated decision.
To discuss any of these rights, please contact dataprotection@dmu.ac.uk and let us know how we can help.
DMU is the data controller
DMU is the data controller.  This means that we determine the purpose of the processing and are responsible for the adequate protection of personal information.
All our staff are appropriately trained and understand their responsibilities for protecting personal data.
When we purchase services or support from a third party, or outsource a service or function to a third party, we remain the data controller, and our suppliers and service providers must adhere to our contract terms and conditions, which include data protection and information security requirements.
How to make a Subject Access Request
You can make a Subject Access Request (SAR) to find out what information DMU holds about you.  We will respond to your request within one calendar month.
To make a SAR, please either email us at dataprotection@dmu.ac.uk or complete and submit our online SAR form.
There is not normally a fee for a SAR, but if your request is involves an excessive amount of information, we may charge an administration fee.  We will let you know beforehand if we intend to apply an administration fee.
To help us locate your information, please include with your request your name (and any other names you have been known by, if relevant), the period for which the information relates (the calendar year(s), or academic year(s) for students), your date of birth, your address at the time, and your DMU identification number (if relevant).  We will send the information to you by email.
Before we can disclose any information to you, we will need to see evidence of your identity.  We ask for photo ID if possible.  Please include either a copy of your passport (showing your photo, name, date of birth and signature), or a copy of your driving licence (UK or EEA photo card driving licence).
If you do not have either of the above, please send us a copy of your original birth certificate.
If you don’t have any of the above documents, please send us two documents from the below list.  These must be addressed to you and cannot both be bank statements or from the same utility company.
Utility bill
Council tax bill
Bank statement
Old style driving licence
Official notification letter from either the DWP or HMRC
You can ask someone else to make a SAR on your behalf.  We will need to see evidence that the person making the request is entitled to act on your behalf and they will also need to provide us with evidence of your identity.
How to complain
If you have any concerns or wish to complain about a data protection issue, please contact our Data Protection Officer at DPO@dmu.ac.uk
If you are dissatisfied with the way DMU has handled your complaint, you have a right to complain to the Information Commissioner’s Office at ICO.org.uk
Social media
We use information posted publicly on social media to so we can make information available where it may be relevant or of interest. We never attempt to access private social media accounts.
If you raise a query or a complaint through DMU’s social media, we’ll of course have a record of your user name. We will only use this to resolve your query or complaint and to improve your user experience with the university.
