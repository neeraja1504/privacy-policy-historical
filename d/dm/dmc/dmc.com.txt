How we share your information:
We do not, and will not, sell any of your personal data to any third party – including your name, address, email address or credit card information. We want to earn and maintain your trust, and we believe this is absolutely essential in order do that.
However, we share your data with the following categories of companies as an essential part of being able to provide our services to you, as set out in this statement:
* Companies in the DMC Group, as sometimes different bits of our group are responsible for different activities (especially licensed ones)
* Companies that do things to get your purchases to you, such as payment service providers, warehouses, order packers, and delivery companies
* Professional service providers, such as marketing agencies, advertising partners and website hosts, who help us run our business
* Credit reference agencies, law enforcement and fraud prevention agencies, so we can help tackle fraud
We may provide third parties with aggregated but anonymised information and analytics about our customers and, before we do so, we will make sure that it does not identify you.
How we store your information
We’ll hold on to your information for as long as you have your account, or as long as is needed to be able to provide the services to you, or (in the case of any contact you may have with our Customer Care team) for as long as is necessary to provide support-related reporting and trend analysis only.
If reasonably necessary or required to meet legal or regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, prevent fraud and abuse, or enforce our terms and conditions, we may also keep hold of some of your information as required, even after you have closed your account or it is no longer needed to provide the services to you.
We don’t gather any more information than is necessary for fulfilling our obligations to you and providing a great customer experience, and we don’t hold on to your data for longer than is necessary.
We have a fulfilment centre in the USA, which we may use for processing orders from customers in the EU. The USA is not a country in respect of which there is a European Commission decision of adequacy, and we protect your privacy and your rights through the use of the European Commission’s standard data protection clauses. More information about these is available here http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32010D0087
How we deliver marketing and advertising messages
If you have said we can, we’ll send you marketing messages by email to keep you aware of our products, promotions and other content.
You can stop receiving marketing messages from us at any time by clicking on the ‘unsubscribe’ link in any email or by contacting our Customer Service team.
Once you do this, we will update your profile to ensure that you don’t receive further marketing messages.
Stopping marketing messages will not stop service communications (such as order updates or where you have expressed an interest in a product or activity).
We also engage in online advertising, also to keep you aware of what we’re up to and to help you see and find our products.
Like many companies, we target banners and ads to you when you are on other websites and apps. We do this using a variety of digital marketing networks and ad exchanges, and we use a range of advertising technologies like web beacons, pixels, ad tags, cookies, and mobile identifiers, as well as specific services offered by some sites and social networks, such as Facebook’s Custom Audience service.
The banners and ads you see will be based on anonymised and aggregated information we hold about you, or your previous use of our website.
How we use cookies
Like most websites, we use cookies when you visit our site. There are four main types of cookies – here’s how and why we use them.
(1) Site functionality cookies – these cookies allow you to navigate the site and use our features, such as “Add to Bag” and “Save for Later”.
(2) Site analytics cookies – these cookies allow us to measure and analyse how our customers use the site, to improve both its functionality and your shopping experience.
(3) Customer preference cookies – when you are browsing or shopping on DMC, these cookies will remember your preferences (like your language or location), so we can make your shopping experience as seamless as possible, and more personal to you.
(4) Targeting or advertising cookies – these cookies are used to deliver ads relevant to you. They also limit the number of times that you see an ad and help us measure the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.
By using our site, you agree to us placing these sorts of cookies on your device and accessing them when you visit the site in the future. If you want to delete any cookies that are already on your computer, the “help” section in your browser should provide instructions on how to locate the file or directory that stores cookies.

* The right to request the correction of inaccurate personal information we hold about you

* The right to stop direct marketing messages, and to withdraw consent for other consent-based processing at any time
* The right to request that we transfer or port elements of your data either to you or another service provider
