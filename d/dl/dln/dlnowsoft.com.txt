Privacy Policy
Introduction
We at DLNow are committed to respecting your online privacy and recognize your need for appropriate protection and management of any personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") you share with us. DLNow has established this Online Privacy Policy so that you can understand the care with which we intend to treat your Personal Information. For the purposes of this statement, "Personal Information" means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, a home or other physical address and an email address or other contact information, whether at work or at home.
Information Collection
We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you ("Personal Information") or allows us to contact you. Generally this information is requested when you want to provide us with your personal data, to give us the opportunity to get in touch with you.
We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is also used to help identify you and your time spent at our sites, and to gather broad demographic information. This allows us to see which parts of our sites users are visiting. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means, for instance, that a user's session will be tracked, but the user will remain anonymous. We do not use this information for any other purposes.
Use of personal information
DLNow does not intend to transfer Personal Information without your consent to third parties who are not bound to act on DLNow behalf unless such transfer is legally required. Similarly, it is against DLNow policy to sell Personal Information collected online without consent. In short, DLNow does not sell registrant information to lists. In some cases, DLNow may use a visitor's personal information to understand overall patterns for site usage, to contact the user for clarification on inaccurate information, or to follow up on a customer service issue. Personal information may include name, address, telephone number, etc.
