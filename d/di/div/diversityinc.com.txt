Personally identifiable information provided by subscribers (name, email or home address, etc.) is never disclosed to any individual or business.
Cookies
Each time a subscriber logs into DiversityIncBestPractices.com, we store a temporary “cookie” in the browser files of that subscriber’s computer. This cookie is used during your online session to allow you free access to the subscribers area, without repeatedly requiring you to re-enter your user name and password.
When you log off or leave the site, the cookie file is automatically removed.

In order to provide visitors with greater value, some of our pages may provide links to various third-party websites. Subscriber information and “cookies” are not provided to the third-party sites.
However, keep in mind that many sites do attempt to capture visitor information when you browse those sites. Once you leave our site, we are not able to alert you should another site attempt to gather information from your browser.
Private Forums
We provide our subscribers with a comment feature that makes sharing information with other subscribers easy. To protect your privacy when posting or replying to comments, your personal information and email are not revealed.
However, remember that any information you disclose in the message areas can be read by all other subscribers, so exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.
