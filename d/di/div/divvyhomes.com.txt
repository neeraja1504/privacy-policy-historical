Last Updated on November 11th, 2013
Scope
We at Plaid Inc. ("we", "us" or "our") know you care about how your personal information is used and shared - and we take your privacy seriously. This privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") covers our treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information"), and certain non-personally identifiable information, that we gather when you use or otherwise engage (via mobile application, web browsing or otherwise) with our website or services (collectively, the "Service"). It describes what types of information we collect, how we use that information, and who we share that information with.
By using or accessing the Service in any manner, you acknowledge that you accept and agree to the terms, practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you hereby consent that we may collect, use, and share your information as set forth below.
This policy does not apply to any website, product or service of any third-party company even if the website or application links to (or from) the Service. Plaid does not operate those websites, products, or services - please always review the privacy practices of a company before deciding whether to provide any information to them.
Information We Collect
In general, we collect information in a number of ways, including (i) when a client or end-user provides it directly to us via the Website and/or Service, (ii) when we obtain end-user information through trusted third parties including financial institutions, (iii) through your continued access of the Service, including data passively collected through technology such as "cookies". The types of information we collect and our use of that information will depend on whether you are a Website Visitor, Client, or End-User.
By signing up for the Service, whether directly on our site, with one of the third-party applications that uses our software, or by any other means, you consent to these terms. Some features of the Service allow you to provide content, including financial credentials and information, to the Service. All content submitted by you to the Service or collected on your behalf from a third-party (e.g., client) application or a financial institution (e.g., a bank) may be retained by us indefinitely, even after you terminate your account. We may continue to disclose such content to third parties in a manner that does not reveal Personal Information, as described in this Privacy Policy
Cookies and IP Addresses
We automatically receive and record information from your web browser when you interact with the Service, including your IP address and cookie information. This information is used for fighting spam/malware and also to facilitate collection of data concerning your interaction with the Service (e.g., what links you have clicked on). Generally, the Service automatically collect usage information, such as the number and frequency of visitors to the Site. We may use this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us and third parties authorized by us to figure out how often individuals use parts of the Service so that we can analyze and improve them. We may also receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. We use this confirmation to improve our customer service.

Our cookies do not, by themselves, contain Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who you are. As noted, however, we do use cookies to identify that your web browser has accessed aspects of the Service and may associate that information with your Account if you have one. Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave cookies active, because they enable you to take advantage the most attractive features of the Service.
