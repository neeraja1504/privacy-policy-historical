We will fully cooperate with any request to release information to any law enforcement agency when a proper request is received. We may also take steps to protect the health and well being of members, visitors and other parties if we have reason to believe that any of these persons are in danger.
When you register with and use divxme.com, you create your own profile and privacy settings and the information you submit/post, such as personal information, comments, messages, photos, etc. may be shared with other members and visitors in accordance with the privacy settings you select.

We sometimes receive calls from and/or attempt to call parents or guardians about a minor's use of a credit card belonging to someone other than the member. Where a credit card belonging to a person other than the member has been submitted, we will first attempt to verify the identity of the caller as being the credit card holder and, if this is verified, we may release the name of the member who submitted the credit card information to us. It is important that you have the full consent of the credit card holder before submitting their card number to us to pay for services. We reserve the right to cancel your account at any time and prohibit your future use of the divxme.com site if you attempt to use a credit card without prior authorization.
