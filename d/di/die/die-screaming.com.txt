Privacy and Ethics Policy
We promise to never use our website or the Internet to spy on you while you pee.
The Internet is full of shitty people who will steal your information and then use it to do all kinds of horrible things.  Additionally, many websites that you visit collect as much information about you as possible.  The owners of these websites will use this information for any number of things, everything from adding your email address to their mailing list to outright selling your information to third parties.  I want to take a moment to make it clear to all of our visitors that Die-Screaming doesn’t do any of that crap.
We will never, not even ever, give any of your information that you choose to share with us (Name, Email, Weird Sex Fetishes) with any third party.
We will not add you to any of our mailing lists.  In fact, we don’t even have a mailing list.
While we do require users to register with us to leave a comment, we only do this to stop assholes from spamming us.  We do not, and will not, use this information for anything else.
If you follow us on Twitter and/or Facebook, we promise never to spam, harass, hack, stalk, or send you pictures of our genitals.
You will never see a pop-up on this site, and if you do, your computer is probably infected with either a virus or spyware.
Bottom line: We strongly believe in your right, everyone’s right, to absolute privacy and we conduct ourselves and our website accordingly.
We will never use this website to promote any form of hate speech, nor will we allow anyone to post any comments that can be considered hate speech.
Each and every one of our blog posts is original content that we wrote.  Yes, we do sometimes reference the work of others, but we will always properly give credit where credit is due.
We do have affiliate links on this site.  We do this to offset the costs associated with running this website.  Also, it helps fund our raging alcoholism and addiction to comics, porn, and movies.
We do not do “sponsored” reviews.  If we choose to review something (movie, comic, piece of tech, etc.) it’s because we chose to.  Any opinion we offer in any of our blog posts is our own.  We are not for sale.
At times, we use some pretty harsh language on this site.  Additionally, we frequently discuss things like porn, violence, and sex.  We assume that anyone who is reading this site is of a mature enough mindset to handle that kind of shit.  If foul language offends you, I’m sorry.  Go somewhere else.
Die-Screaming has no parent company.  This website is owned by Dan C. and he runs it with the help of some of his friends.  No one involved makes a living from this website and we answer to no one.
