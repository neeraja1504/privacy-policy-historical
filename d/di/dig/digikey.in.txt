What does Digi-Key do?

For more information about Digi-Key, please see the "About Digi-Key" section of our website.
What personal information does Digi-Key collect and why?
The personal information that we may collect about you broadly falls into the following categories:
Information that you provide voluntarily
Certain parts of our website may ask you to provide personal information voluntarily. For example, we may ask you to provide your contact details in order to register an account with us, to fulfil an order you place with us, to subscribe to our newsletters or other marketing communications from us, and/or to submit enquiries to us. We also collect your credit card details when you make a purchase with us. The personal information that you are asked to provide, and the reasons why you are asked to provide it, will be made clear to you at the point we ask you to provide your personal information (unless it is obvious from the context).
If you leave comments on the website, information associated with that comment, such as your user name and the time of the post, may be saved. Information is also collected from our online customer support chat service (such as your chat login details and chat communications, which we monitor for quality assurance purposes).
Information that we collect automatically
When you visit our website, we and our third party service providers or partners may collect certain information automatically from your device. In some countries, including countries in the European Economic Area, this information may be considered personal information under applicable data protection laws.
Specifically, the information automatically collected may include information like your IP address, device type, unique device identification numbers, browser-type, broad geographic location (e.g. country or city-level location) and other technical information. It may also include information about how your device has interacted with our website, including the pages accessed and links clicked.
Collecting this information provides a better understanding of the visitors who come to our website, where they come from, and what content on our website is of interest to them. This information is used for our internal analytics purposes, to improve the quality and relevance of our website to our visitors, and to enhance the security of our website.
Some of this information is necessary for the proper functioning of the website and may be collected using cookies and similar tracking technology, as explained further under the heading "Cookies and similar tracking technology" below.
Information that we obtain from third party sources
Our website may contain links to third party websites, embedded content that comes from or relates to third party websites and services, and buttons from third party websites and services (such as social media sharing buttons). From time to time, we may receive personal information about you from third party sources.
These third party sources may include, but are not limited to, suppliers, third party web analytics services and social media platforms, such as YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram. The types of information we may receive from these third parties includes information on your web activity about how you interact with our website and their services and aggregated analytics. We use this information to help improve our website, provide information and advertising, and to be able to analyze aggregate click statistics and trends.
Who does Digi-Key share my personal information with?
We may disclose your personal information to the following categories of recipients:
to our related companies and third party suppliers, partners and services providers (for example, to support the delivery or drop shipment of products ordered, provide functionality on, or help to enhance the security of our website, or for order fulfilment or market research purposes), or who otherwise process personal information for purposes that are described in this Privacy Notice or notified to you when we collect your personal information. For example, we utilize services provided by our third party partners to enable the detection of devices connected with fraud and other types of information security vulnerabilities to enhance security on our website and other pages on the internet.
to any competent law enforcement body, regulatory body, government agency, court or other third party where we believe disclosure is necessary (i) as a matter of applicable law or regulation, (ii) to exercise, establish or defend our legal rights, (iii) as part of a lawsuit or investigation, or (iv) to protect your vital interests or those of any other person;
to credit reference agencies for the purposes of identity and credit checking when placing an order, and periodically if you have an open account with us;
to an actual or potential buyer (and its agents and advisers) in connection with any actual or proposed purchase, merger or acquisition of any part of our business, or as part of reorganization, bankruptcy, or change in ownership control, provided that we inform the recipient it must use your personal information only for the purposes disclosed in this Privacy Notice;
to any other person with your consent to the disclosure.
Legal basis for processing personal information (EEA visitors only)
If you are a visitor from the European Economic Area, our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.
However, we will normally collect personal information from you only (i) where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, (ii) where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your rights, or (iii) where we have your consent to do so.
If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us using the contact details provided under the "How to contact us" heading below.
Cookies and similar tracking technology
We use cookies and similar tracking technology (collectively, " Cookies ") to collect and use personal information about you, including to serve interest-based advertising. For further information about the types of Cookies we use, why, and how you can control Cookies, please see our Cookie Notice.
How does Digi-Key keep my personal information secure?
We use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the personal information that we collect and process about you. The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information.
In particular, Digi-Key's website is equipped with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. Online orders to Digi-Key can only be placed from a browser that supports SSL. Where this is the case, your browser will automatically enter a secure mode when you make purchases. If your browser does not support SSL or you would like to place orders using a method other than the website, please review the Ordering FAQs for alternative ordering methods.
International data transfers
Your personal information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident. These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country and, in some cases, may not be as protective.
Specifically, our website servers are located in USA, and our group companies and third party service providers and partners operate around the world. This means that when we collect your personal information we may process it in any of these countries.
However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Notice. These include implementing the European Commissionâ€™s Standard Contractual Clauses where appropriate, which can be provided on request. We have implemented similar appropriate safeguards with our third party service providers and partners and further details can also be provided upon request.
Data retention
We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax, compliance, or accounting requirements).
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
Your data protection rights
You have the following data protection rights:
If you wish to access, correct, update or request deletion of your personal information, you can do so at any time by contacting us using the contact details provided under the "How to contact us" heading below.
In addition, you can object to processing of your personal information, ask us to restrict processing of your personal information or request portability of your personal information. Again, you can exercise these rights by contacting us using the contact details provided under the "How to contact us" heading below.
You have the right to opt-out of marketing communications we send you at any time. You can exercise this right by clicking on the "unsubscribe" or "opt-out" link in the marketing e-mails we send you. To opt-out of other forms of marketing (such as postal marketing or telemarketing), then please contact us using the contact details provided under the "How to contact us" heading below.
Similarly, if we have collected and process your personal information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal information. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority. Contact details for data protection authorities in the European Economic Area are available here.
We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
Children
The website is not intended to solicit, collect or process personal information from any individual under the age of 16. If you are a parent or guardian, please contact us if you believe information regarding a child has been collected by us through our website.
Do Not Track
Presently the website does not honor "do not track" settings on web browsers and does not offer you the opportunity to request that we not track your use of its services.
Third party websites
The Digi-Key website may contain links to other websites. Digi-Key cannot take responsibility for personal information collected on these third party websites, nor does Digi-Key monitor or accept responsibility for the accuracy or content of these other websites.
Nevada Privacy Rights
A verified request under Nevada law to not make any sale of any personal information we have collected or will collect about you may be sent to customer.inactive@digikey.com. Please included in your email "Request for Nevada Opt-Out" in the subject line and in the body of your message. Digi-Key currently does not sell personal information to third parties as defined under Nevada law.
Updates to this Privacy Notice
We may update this Privacy Notice from time to time in response to changing legal, technical or business developments.
