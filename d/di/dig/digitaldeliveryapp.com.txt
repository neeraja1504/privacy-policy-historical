Cookies
A cookie is a text file that websites send to a visitor’s computer to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. Cookies may use your IP address, timestamps, logins. Information collected from cookies is used by us to evaluate the effectiveness of our website, analyse trends, and administer our website. This allows us to determine such things as which parts of our website are most visited and difficulties our visitors may experience in accessing our website.
We use cookies for authentication (logging you into your account), site functionality (the shopping cart, the affiliate scheme and the referral scheme), to analyse our site performance (via Google Analytics) and for advertising management (SendOwl adverts you may see around the internet). These cookies record session information on the device you're using to access our website.
For cookies that are essential, your consent is not required. For the use of the other types of cookies described in this policy, we do ask you for your consent when you first visit our website. You can withdraw your consent or remove these cookies at any time via your browser preferences but you will have to re-login to the SendOwl site if you remove the authentication cookie. To find out more about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set and how to manage and remove them, visit www.allaboutcookies.org. To explore what cookie settings are available to you, look in the "preferences" or "options" section of your browser's menu.
Data Collection and Storage
SendOwl collects personal data and stores it securely. We also use third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary equipment required to run the service. Specifically: Cloudflare, Amazon Web Service, Rackspace, MailGun, Google Analytics, FreeAgent, HelpScout, Stripe and MailChimp. We have contracts in place with our third party vendors that require them to use personal data only as necessary to perform services on our behalf and to implement appropriate security measures as required by law.
Retention and Withdrawal
We retain your personal data as long as needed for the purposes for which we collected it, plus a reasonable period to take into account the applicable statute of limitation period or to comply with legal requirements.
Data Transfer
We may transfer your personal data to recipients in countries other than the country in which the personal data originally was collected. Those countries may not offer the same level of protection to your personal data. When we transfer your personal data to recipients outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”), we will comply with applicable legal requirements by providing adequate protection for the transfer of personal data, including by (i) entering into the European Commission’s EU Standard Contractual Clauses with the data recipients, or (ii) verifying that the recipient has implemented Binding Corporate Rules or has adhered to the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework. To obtain a copy of the safeguards we have put in place, please contact us as indicated below.
Data Security
We protect your personal data which we collect and store by implementing administrative, technical and physical security measures. These measures ensure an appropriate level of security and confidentiality for your personal data.
