Use of Information Obtained by Digparty
Profile information is used by Digparty primarily to be presented back to and edited by you when you access the service and to be presented to others permitted to view that information.
Digparty may send you service-related announcements from time to time through the general operation of the service.
Digparty may use information in your profile without identifying you as an individual to third parties. We do this for purposes such as aggregating how many people like a band or movie and personalizing advertisements and promotions so that we can provide you Digparty. We believe this benefits you. You can know more about the world around you and, where there are advertisements, they're more likely to be interesting to you.
We may use information about you that we collect from other sources, including but not limited to newspapers and Internet sources such as blogs, instant messaging services, Digparty Platform developers and other users of Digparty, to supplement your profile.
Sharing Your Information with Third Parties
Digparty is about sharing information with others â€” friends and people who host and attend a Digparty session.
We may provide information to service providers to help us bring you the services we offer. Specifically, we may use third parties to facilitate our business, such as to host the service at a co-location facility for servers, to send out email updates about Digparty, to remove repetitive information from our user lists, to process payments for products or services, to offer an online job application process, or to provide search results or links (including sponsored links). In connection with these offerings and business operations, our service providers may have access to your personal information for use for a limited time in connection with these business activities. Where we utilize third parties for the processing of any personal information, we implement reasonable contractual and technical protections limiting the use of that information to the Digparty-specified purposes.
We may be required to disclose user information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws. We do not reveal information until we have a good faith belief that an information request by law enforcement or private litigants meets applicable legal standards. Additionally, we may share account or other information when we believe it is necessary to comply with law, to protect our interests or property, to prevent fraud or other illegal activity perpetrated through the Digparty service or using the Digparty name, or to prevent imminent bodily harm. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, agents or government agencies.
We may offer stores or provide services jointly with other companies on Digparty. We may share customer information with that company in connection with your use of that store or service.
If the ownership of all or substantially all of the Digparty business, or individual business units owned by Digparty were to change, your user information may be transferred to the new owner so the service can continue operations. In any such transfer of information, your user information would remain subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy.

Digparty may contain links to other websites. We are of course not responsible for the privacy practices of other web sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by Digparty.
