When you visit a web-page that is operated by digiDirect for one of its business partners; when you visit a co-branded web-page that is operated in conjunction with digiDirect, will be governed by the privacy policy that will be accessible from that web-page and which you may view before you provide or authorise the provision of that personal information. It is your own choice whether or not you decide to disclose any personal information to digiDirect business partners.
