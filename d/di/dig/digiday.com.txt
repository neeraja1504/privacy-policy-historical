We collect your data (specifically outlined below, but generally basic information about you in a professional context, such as email, job title, company name, etc) strictly to provide you with access to our news, events and other programs.

You deserve to know how we collect and use the data you provide to us, and thatâ€™s what we are providing to you on this page. This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the Digiday website or through our tools such as Digiday Connect, or the website of our sister sites, specifically Glossy and Gather.

How we use your information
We use the data you provide to us for the following purposes:

In these instances, we will make it clear that the data you share will be transferred to the third party. You will always have the option to not have your data shared by not taking part in that specific program.
We will store this information to keep you informed about other relevant products that may be useful to you.
We will never use or share the information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above.
