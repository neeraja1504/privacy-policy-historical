How long we keep your personal information for

11.2.

11.3. When we use service providers or other data processors to process personal information on our behalf, we require them to follow our instructions and apply appropriate technical and organisational security measures to protect the personal information they process on our behalf, which may include the following:
a. Obtaining the data processor's undertaking that neither itself nor its employees shall disclose personal information to any third party without our authorisation.

11.4. When you log into your account to use our services with your phone number or username and password, all data is using cryptographic protocols designed to provide communications security such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption. We employ such cryptographic protocols on all pages on our websites where we collect personal information.

12.2. This means that we may transfer your personal information to countries outside Malaysia for the processing of Personal Data. Such countries may not provide the same level of protection as Malaysia, so when we process personal information internationally, we take appropriate steps to ensure that your personal information is adequately protected. Typically, such steps include carrying out data security reviews of any recipients and putting in place contracts with such recipients, which require the recipients to ensure that personal information in that country will not be processed in a manner which, if that country is Malaysia, would be in contravention of the applicable data protection laws in Malaysia.
