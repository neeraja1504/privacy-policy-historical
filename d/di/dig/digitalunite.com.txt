Disclosure of personal information

Digital Champions self-enrol on the Digital Champions Network using a voucher code that is created by Digital Unite. Where a client organisation buys a membership, they can then recruit their Digital Champions and distribute the voucher codes which Digital Unite has provided to them. Only the client organisation can access their own Digital Champions’ personal information, in addition to Digital Unite.
We may use third parties to process your personal information on our behalf. Where we do so, we ensure that they process information in accordance with our confidentiality and security requirements as well as in accordance with data protection requirements.
