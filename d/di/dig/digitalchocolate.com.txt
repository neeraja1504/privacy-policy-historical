Third parties that place advertising on our Service may also use cookies.

Third Party Tools
The Service may also contain third party tracking tools from service providers, examples of which include Magic Box, Flurry and AdMob.  Digital Chocolate may use these third parties’ APIs/SDKs in our Service, which may enable these third parties to analyze user information.  While these third parties may have access to your personal information in connection with the performance of services for Digital Chocolate, they may not use such information for any purpose other than providing their services.

The offer wall allows third party advertisers to provide virtual currency to users in exchange for completing an offer, fulfilling a survey or otherwise interacting with an advertisement. These are offers made by third party advertisers; not by Digital Chocolate.
These offers may be targeted to you based on certain information, such as your geographic area or other demographic information. After clicking on one of these advertisements, you will no longer be on a site hosted by Digital Chocolate orthe SNS.
We may need to share your user ID number with the offer wall provider.

Once you complete an offer, you will then return to Digital Chocolate’s Service.

Phishing
Identity theft and the practice currently known as “phishing” are of great concern to Digital Chocolate. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your account ID, login password, or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication.

How We Protect Your Information
We have put reasonable security measures in place to prevent the loss, misuse, destruction and alteration of information under our control. For example, when you access your Account Information, we use the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol to encrypt information you input before it is sent to us.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information over the Internet is not completely secure. Although we strive to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data while it is being transmitted to our Site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we have procedures and security features in place to try to prevent unauthorized access.
