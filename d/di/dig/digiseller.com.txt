Your privacy on the Internet is of the utmost importance to us. Because we gather certain types of information about the users of DigiSeller.com, we feel you should fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses what information we gather, how we use it, and how to correct or change it.
DigiSeller.com has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website:
http://www.digiseller.com/.
This site contains links to other sites. DigiSeller.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.
Users will receive e-mails regarding their account status with us, however, users may opt-out of receiving future mailings from DigiSeller.com or additional third parties regarding a product or service that DigiSeller.com or third parties may think would be of value to you; see the choice/opt-out section below.
1. Information DigiSeller.com gathers or tracks.
We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is used to gather broad demographic information. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a user session will be tracked, but the user will be anonymous.
A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information, such as a user ID and password, which the site may use to track the pages you've visited. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. DigiSeller.com uses cookies in only two instances--when you log-in as a DigiSeller.com user and when you click an ad:
Log-in: when you log-in, DigiSeller.com uses a cookie to store your username and password. We do not store any other personal information about you.

Cookies also enable you, when you log-in, to enter DigiSeller.com as a user without having to log on each time, and to visit member-restricted areas of our site. We encrypt the password for added security.
Ads: We use an outside ad company to display ads on our site. These ads may contain cookies. While we use cookies in other parts of our Web site, our ad company collects cookies received with banner ads, and we do not have access to this information. These cookies are used by our outside ad company to better track ad impressions and click rates.
