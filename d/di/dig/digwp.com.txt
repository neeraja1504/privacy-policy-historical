How long the data will be stored (or the criteria used to determine that period)
If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us.
For any such request, we will provide you with the information within 30 days, unless doing so would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others (e.g. another person’s confidentiality or intellectual property rights). We’ll tell you if we can’t meet your request for that reason.

At any time and for any reason, you may contact us to correct any inaccurate personal information that we may have about you.

We have physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the data we collect. Every effort is made to ensure that Digging Into WordPress data is safe and secure. Our business literally depends on solid security, so it is taken very seriously.
We do not share your information
Other than the third-party vendors listed below, or in situations where we have obtained your consent, we do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer any personally identifiable information to outside parties.

Note that you can find the privacy policy for each of our trusted third-party vendors below, in the section “Third parties who process your data”.
Steps we take to help secure your data
We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you submit a request, place an order, or access your personal information. These security measures include, but are not limited to:
Password protected directories and databases
SSL technology for encrypted data transmission
Proprietary security measures that actively protect our servers from threats and malicious activity
We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted to our third-party payment processors via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our Payment gateway provider's database, only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and who are required to keep the information confidential. After a transaction, your billing information (credit card numbers, etc.) will NOT be stored on our servers.
And please remember:
You are responsible of your username and password: keep them secret and safe
If you believe your privacy has been breached, please contact us immediately
You provide personal data at your own risk: unfortunately, no data transmission is guaranteed to be 100% secure
