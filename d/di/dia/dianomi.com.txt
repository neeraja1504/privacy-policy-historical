Change of purpose
We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose.
Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.
Disclosures of your personal data
We may share data or aggregated data with affiliates, subsidiaries or service providers for the purpose of delivering our services.
Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy notice.
We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law.
International transfers
We share your personal data within the Dianomi Group. This will involve transferring your data outside the European Economic Area ( EEA ).
Some of our External Third Parties in North America and APAC are based outside the European Economic Area ( EEA ) so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.
Data security
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
Data retention
How long will you use my personal data for?
The retention period will depend on the type of data concerned.
Data in our DMP is retained for 12 months for users outside the US, Canada, Singapore, Hong Kong, India, then deleted.
Data relating to contracts might be kept for 7 years (ie the 6 years within which a legal claim could be brought under the contract plus one year for the claim to be dealt with).
Financial data (eg payments) are kept for 12 years.
Your legal rights
You have the right to make a complaint at any time to the data protection authority about data protection issues. To know more, please contact your local data protection authority on  this link.
We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach your local authority so please contact us in the first instance.
You have certain rights regarding your personal data, please see here.
Where we rely on our legitimate interests to obtain and use your personal data then you have the right to object if you believe your fundamental rights and freedoms outweigh our legitimate interests.
Where processing is carried out based upon your consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent.
Your ability to exercise these rights will depend on a number of factors and in some instances, we will not be able to comply with your request e.g. because we have legitimate grounds for not doing so or where the right does not apply to the particular data we hold on you.
You should note that if you exercise certain of these rights we may be unable to continue to provide some or all of our services to you (for example where the personal data is required by us to comply with a statutory requirement, or is necessary in order for us to perform our contract with you).
Please contact us to update or correct your information if it changes or if the personal data we hold about you is inaccurate.
You may also exercise a right to complain to your Supervisory Authority. Please contact the Data Protection Officer if you wish to exercise any of your rights.
If you wish to exercise any of your rights, please contact us
No fee usually required
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
What we may need from you
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity such as your driving licence or passport and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
Time limit to respond
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
