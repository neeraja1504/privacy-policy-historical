Without additional information, this information alone cannot usually be used to identify you.
4. Use of Personal and Other Information
The information we collect from you, to the extent that it is private, is used and/or disclosed only in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Comments that you make to your stylist are not made publicly viewable.
We use your personal information to verify your registration, to provide you with the styling, the Box, and other services available through our Website, to process your transactions, and to provide and ship products to you. We will use the email address you provided to us to communicate with you about your transactions and to respond to your inquiries.
In addition, we may use your Personally Identifying Information and/or Customer Data:

For these reasons, you need to enable cookies in your browser. If you choose not to accept cookies, you will not be able to use certain features of our Website.

7. Links to Third Party Websites
Dia.com provides links to third-party websites such as Pinterest, Facebook, and Instagram. Those websites have their own privacy policies that may differ substantially from ours. Please review the privacy policy and terms of service for each site you visit through such links.
8. Third-Party Access to and Sharing of Personal Information
Dia.com uses other companies to provide support to our Website and our Services, and we must share your personal information and transactional information with these companies, or they may collect your personal information directly, so that they can provide their services to us and ultimately to you. For example, we use a third-party company to host our site and another third-party company to process your payments. Our contracts with those companies prohibit those companies from making use of your Personally Identifying Information for any purpose other than to assist our Site and Service.
Your payments are handled by a third-party payment processor. By making a purchase on the Site, you authorize us to collect, share, and otherwise use your information in conjunction with our payment processor. All credit-card information is stored by our payment processor; dia.com itself does not retain credit card numbers.
We may combine your Personally Identifying Information and Customer Data with other information about you (such as demographic information and past purchase history) available from our records and other sources. This information will be used to make our future marketing efforts more efficient.
Your Personally Identifying Information and Customer Data may also be shared with our third party service providers that assist us with our marketing efforts and with other marketers whose products or services we believe may be of interest to you. If you prefer that we do not share your name and address with other marketers, please email us at privacy@dia.com.
Dia.com may co-market its products with those of other companies, or we may rent or sell information about you, including your Personally Identifying Information and Customer Data, to other companies that offer products that may be of interest to you. Such other companies will receive your email and/or mailing address and other Personally Identifying Information and, occasionally, Customer Data.
You can direct us not to share your Personally Identifying Information and Customer Data with such other companies by sending us an email to privacy@dia.com.
Finally, in the event our Website or company is sold or restructured, the personal information that we have collected about you will be transferred to the acquiring company. The acquiring company will assume the rights and obligations regarding your personal information as described in this privacy policy.
9. Release of Your Information for Legal Purposes
At times Dia&Co may be required by law to release information about you in response to a legal request from a government agency or a private litigant. In the event that we receive a subpoena affecting your privacy, we may elect to notify you to give you an opportunity to file a motion to quash the subpoena, or we may attempt to quash it ourselves, but we are not obligated to do either, and in certain cases we may be prohibited from notifying you. We also reserve the right to report you, and release personal information about you to, law enforcement or other appropriate third parties where we believe that it is prudent to do so for legal reasons, such as our belief that you have engaged in fraudulent activities.
If you are a New Jersey consumer, the terms of this Section 9 do not limit or waive your rights as a consumer under New Jersey law and the provisions in this Privacy Policy are intended to be only as broad and inclusive as is permitted by the laws of the State of New Jersey.
