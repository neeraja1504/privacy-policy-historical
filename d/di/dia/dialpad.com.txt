Cookies
Our website uses cookies to improve your experience at our site. Cookies manage Dialpad call sessions, provide customizable and personalized services and enhance your web viewing experience. Cookies are user-specific data that are sent by a web server and are stored on your computer. Cookies are created by the web server or the Java script in the HTML. When you visit Dialpad, cookies will be sent to your web browser by a web server, which can be later read by that server. We use cookies to:
Keep track of your session ID to allow you to securely login and manage your account.
Measure certain aggregated traffic patterns of the Dialpad web site to enhance the service that we provide to you.
Ensure that new users are able to sign up correctly.
We use cookies only for these objectives. Cookies cannot be used to get data from your hard drive, your email or any other personal data about you. We do not ask if you accept cookies or not on our website. However, if you set your web browser to not accept cookies, you cannot use our service.
In some cases our Ad Network will place clear gifs on our site in order to track the effectiveness of Dialpad's ads that appear on third party Web sites.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. This information is not tied to our customers' personally identifiable information.
Information Dialpad Gathers and Tracks
We collect IP addresses to administer our website and diagnose problems. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information. In addition, we collect information regarding log times, call duration, call numbers, country code and region code of our users for internal data analyses only. Such website usage information is not personally identifiable information. Personally identifiable information is data about you that distinguishes you specifically such as first name and last name, email address, postal address, etc.
Our website's registration process asks for contact information (such as name and email address), by which you can be personally identified. When you purchase products or services on our website, you will be asked for financial information, such as account or credit card numbers, as well as billing verification information, such as billing address.
We do not target our services to children under the age of 18. We do not collect personal information from children under the age of 18 without parental consent. Minors under the age of 18 can only use our service with parental consent.

We use demographic and website usage information internally to improve the products and services we provide to you.
If you have provided credit card information, we will not use your credit card information for any purpose other than for processing payments. We use an outside credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services. This company does not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes other than as described herein.
We reserve the right to also use personally identifiable information to investigate and help prevent potentially unlawful activity that threatens either Dialpad, any company affiliated with Dialpad or the general public. Moreover, upon the appropriate request of a government agency, law enforcement, court or as otherwise required by law, Dialpad may disclose personally identifiable information.
We may send information to you from time to time regarding improvements to our services, or about new benefits related to your account. Also, on occasion it may be necessary for Dialpad to send out a service related announcement.  For instance, if our service will be temporarily suspended for maintenance, we may send you an email to that effect. You may not opt-out of these service related communications that enable us to provide information regarding service.
Choice/Opt-In
You may choose to visit our website and not provide any information. If you do not provide any information to us, we will not have any information from you other than the information that the cookies send to your computer. If your cookies are turned off, we will not have any of your information but you will not be able to use our service.
During the period between October 1999 and January 2003, Dialpad allowed its users to 'opt in' on our registration form to receive promotional emails from Dialpad and our partners.  At that time, users were given the ability to 'opt in' and to then complete a survey form that asked for specific demographic information.  This information has been shared with reputable third parties.  If you were a Dialpad user during this time and are receiving emails from any of these partners or from Dialpad and you wish to unsubscribe from their services, please follow the instructions contained in any promotional email to unsubscribe from receiving future promotional emails.  In addition, please send an email to privacy@dialpad.com and include the email address to which you are receiving email and you will be removed from the Dialpad database and will not be included in any future data exchanges between Dialpad and our third party marketing partners.  Any email that is coming to you as a result of your having registered with Dialpad during that time period should have a clear and working link to allow you to unsubscribe; please report any such emails that do not to privacy@dialpad.com.
