We use the information you provide about someone else when placing an order only to ship the product and to confirm delivery. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order. We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.

Information you submit on our website will not be used for this purpose unless you fill out the registration form. We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals. We never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.

All individuals who purchase will be enrolled in our email marketing program. Users are free to opt-out of our email marketing program at any time by selecting unsubscribe at the bottom of any email. Unsubscribing will permanently remove the user from email marketing unless that user enters another contest or requests promotional materials again at a future date. Users requesting catalogs will be enrolled to receive physical mailings alerting them to future sales & promotions. Any user who does not wish to receive physical mailings can contact customer service to be removed from these mailing lists.
