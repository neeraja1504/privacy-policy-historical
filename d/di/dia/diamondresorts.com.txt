As an owner, member or guest we would like to provide you with updates about promotions, special offers, new services and products which may be of interest to you based on what we know about you. If you have booked accommodation with us, we may send you information about offers for related travel services such as flights and rental cars.
Depending on your location (and reflecting applicable law), you may have been asked to indicate your preferences, provide us with your consent regarding the receipt of such information from us, and indicate how you would like to receive it.
Wherever you are located, we will send you marketing communication based on any preferences you may have expressed.
We only want to send you information you are interested in. If you do not want to receive these communications or would like to understand more about other unsubscribe options, see below under "Communications" in this section or please contact us as set out in section 21 headed "Contacting Us".
We do not sell your personal information to third parties for marketing purposes and do not intend to do so in the future, except as expressly described in this policy.
Communications. You can opt out of receiving certain promotional communications (e-mails, text messaging, phone calls, or push notifications) from us at any time by (i) for promotional e-mails, following the instructions provided in e-mails to click on the unsubscribe link, or if available by changing your communication preferences by logging onto your account; (ii) for text messages, following the instructions provided in text messages from us to text the word, "STOP"; (iii) for calls, you can advise us of this during the telephone call, and (iv) for app push notifications, turn off push notifications on the settings of your device and/or the app, as applicable. Please note that your opt-out is limited to the e-mail address or phone number used and will not affect subsequent subscriptions. If you opt-out of only certain communications, other subscription communications may continue. Even if you opt out of receiving promotional communications, we may, subject to applicable law, continue to send you non-promotional communications, such as those about your account, transactions, servicing, or our ongoing business relations.
Mobile Apps. With respect to our mobile apps ("apps"), you can stop all collection of data generated by use of the app by uninstalling the app. Also, you may be able to exercise specific privacy choices, such as enabling or disabling certain features (e.g., location-based services, push notifications, accessing calendar/contacts/photos, etc.), by adjusting the permissions in your mobile device and/or the app’s settings. Beware that if GPS precise location services are disabled, other means of establishing or estimating location (e.g., connecting to or proximity to wi-fi, Bluetooth, beacons, or our networks) may persist.

Certain Tracking Technologies and Interest-based Advertising. For information on how to opt out of processing by certain Tracking Technologies and processing related thereto, including Interest-based Advertising, Matched List Ads, and analytics, please visit our cookie policy.
12. How long will you keep my personal information?
We will retain your personal information for as long as necessary in order to fulfill the purposes for which we collected it and as set out in this Privacy Policy and for the purpose of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements that apply to us. For example, we retain contractual documents for long enough to ensure they are available to us if we need them to resolve disputes. When determining how long to keep your personal information we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of that personal information, the potential risk of harm from its unauthorized use or disclosure, the purposes for which we process it and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means.
13. Devices
We use versions of our regular Sites that are optimized for mobile, which process the personal information you give us in much the same way as our Site does. We offer a Diamond App which allows you to use location services to find accommodations and facilities nearby.
14. Who will the information be shared with, if anyone?
We share your personal information with third parties to fulfil any request to us for bookings or services with them. Vacation ownership sales are protected by the use of a trustee who makes sure ownership is allocated correctly, so if you purchase a vacation ownership product from us we will pass your personal information onto the trustee. As you may expect, if you signed up for finance from a third party finance company we will pass documentation on to them after you have signed it. Like other vacation companies, we are sometimes obliged by law to disclose your personal information to governmental or customs/ immigration authorities in countries on your itinerary.
Like many companies, we pass on customer personal information to external companies we use to carry out services on our behalf such as mailing campaigns, sales and conducting surveys. Sometimes these companies (and their sub-processors) conduct processing of your personal information in countries other than your home country. To learn more about how we protect your personal information when it is subject to a cross-border transfer see section 15 headed Cross-border data transfers from the European Economic Area and Section 16 headed Cross-border data transfers (non EEA or Switzerland).
14.1. Affiliate resorts
Affiliate resorts are resorts which we do not own or manage, but with whom we have agreements to allow members of our vacation ownership clubs to use their points to stay at those resorts. We have agreements with affiliate resorts all over the world to give our members an even greater choice for their perfect vacation, including through promotional communications sent directly to you from the affiliate resorts. If you tell us you want to book an affiliate resort, we will make the booking on your behalf, providing information required by the affiliate to administer your booking and contact you if they need to. We will share your name and contact details, your status as a Diamond Resorts™ member and any access requirements or special requests you tell us about. When you check in and during your stay at an affiliate resort you may be asked for further information.
Any personal information provided to the affiliate will be subject to their privacy policy, which you should read before making a booking.
14.2. Exchange companies
If you are a member or owner you may have signed up for a membership with a third party organization such as Interval International or RCI that allows you to "exchange" your week or points for vacations at non-Diamond resorts. If you signed up with an exchange company when you bought your product from us, we will send your signed contract on to the company along with your name, address, telephone number and e-mail address to allow it to administer your membership.
Any time you request an exchange we will confirm with the exchange company whether or not you are entitled to make the exchange and if you are not the reason why.
14.3. Providers of member benefits
If you are a member or owner you will have access to a wide range of member benefits. You can see which member benefits are currently available by logging onto the member’s area of www.diamondresorts.com. Depending on the provider, you may make a booking or request goods or services yourself by contacting the provider directly, or, we may make them on your behalf. If we make them on your behalf, we will share some personal information with the provider to allow your booking or request to be fulfilled. The information we share about you depends on what member benefit is being provided and may include your name, your status as a Diamond Resorts™ member, any access, medical or dietary requirements you tell us about and your contact information in case the provider needs to contact you. When providing any third party member benefit provider with your personal information directly, you should make sure you read the provider’s privacy policy.
14.4. Travel fulfilment partners
In order to offer a full and seamless service to our members and owners, we have partnered with several companies to allow us to offer, through them, all of the services you need for your vacation (for example, flights and rental cars). Some of these companies also help us to fulfil gifts and incentives provided during the sales process. As you would expect, if you contact us to make a booking with them we will send them the personal information they need to fulfil your request and to send you any tickets and/ or confirmations.
During this process, we might have to share personal information about you, which is sensitive. For example, if you request an airline booking we may pass on information about a medical condition you have told us about or about your dietary requirements to inform meal choices on the flight.
If you are making a booking that is fulfilled by a third party and require further details about how they treat your personal information you should ask us or the fulfilment partner during the booking process so you can be directed to their privacy policy.
14.5. Third party finance providers and providers of banking services
If you purchased third party financing brokered by us when you bought your vacation ownership product we will pass on to them any personal information you provided to us as part of the application process. Similarly, if we need to set up a direct debit to take an agreed regular payment from you, we will pass information about you to our bank to enable us to do this.
14.6. First National Trustee Company Limited
Information for Diamond European Members is shared with First National Trustee Company Limited, an Isle of Man based company (whose details are set out in the Deed of Trust members received when they purchased their product or which you can request from us at any time) in order to enable it to perform its supervisory and regulatory functions.
14.7. Third parties carrying out services on our behalf
We engage third parties to carry out services on our behalf that involve the processing of your personal information. For example, to process reservations, to conduct market research activities, to process the results of contests, to collect monies owed to us, to process payments, to send out mailings for billing or information about our services, to securely store archived or back up data for us and to carry out marketing campaigns on our behalf. In addition, we sometimes use third party providers of software on our websites to collect personal information from you, such as e-mail sign ups and to allow you to share your comments on our resorts and services via social media.
The personal information we provide to such third parties is protected by an appropriate legal agreement ensuring that your personal information is used solely for the purposes for which it was provided.
14.8. Authorities permitted by law
We will only disclose your information to law enforcement and other governmental authorities if required by law or if doing so is strictly necessary for the prevention, detection or prosecution of criminal acts and fraud. Diamond Resorts™ may also disclose owner, member, non-member and non-owner information, if, in good faith, we believe that disclosure is necessary or advisable including, without limitation, to protect the rights or properties of Diamond Resorts™ or in order to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing interference with our rights or properties, whether intentionally or otherwise, or when anyone else could be harmed by such activities.
Laws introduced in the United States and other countries to give cross border control agencies access to customer data. Accordingly, we may disclose any personal information held about you and your travel arrangements to the customs and immigration authorities of any country in your itinerary if required by law.
14.9. Corporate transactions
We may disclose your information to a third party who acquires any part of Diamond Resorts® or any of its affiliates, whether such acquisition is by way of merger, consolidation or purchase of all or a substantial portion of Diamond Resorts™ assets.
