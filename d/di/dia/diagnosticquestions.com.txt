What information are we going to collect from you?
1. The types and amounts of information collected will vary depending on whether the user is a student, parent/guardian or teacher and how users use the Site.
2. Where we collect information directly from a student under the age of 16, we will also ask for a parent/guardian email address from the student so we can seek verifiable parental/guardian consent to the collection and processing of the student’s personal data. In cases, however, where we collect personal data in respect of students from their teachers or schools, we will rely on the authority of the teachers or schools to provide such data to us and will not seek to obtain separate parental/guardian consent to the collection and processing of such students’ personal data.
