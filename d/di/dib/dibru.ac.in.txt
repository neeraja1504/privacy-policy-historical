This policy explains what types of personal information will be gathered when you visit the Dibrugarh University's website, and how this information will be used. Please note that this policy applies to the University's main web pages (i.e. those in www.dibru.ac.in).
All colleges, divisions, faculties, departments, schools, centres, academic services, libraries, museums and collections of the University run and maintain their own websites on the dibru.ac.in domain. These sites may carry their own privacy policy or provide additional information relating to their activities, which will supersede or supplement this Privacy Policy. For further information about the structure of the University's web presence, please see About this site.
If you follow a link to any other website, please check their policies before you submit any personal information to those websites.

The University may store this information manually or electronically. By supplying this information you are consenting to the University holding and using it for the purposes for which it was provided. Information provided will be kept for as long as is necessary to fulfil that purpose.

We may disclose your personal information to third parties if we are under a duty to disclose or share such information in order to comply with any legal obligation or to protect the rights, property or safety of the University, its members or others.
