Privacy Policy
DIME Consultants Inc. has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website: http://www.dime-co.com, and is applicable to ALL of our websites.
Simply put, we NEVER rent, sell, trade, share or give out your private information in any way unless required by law. For more legal details, read on:
We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is used to help identify you and your shopping cart and to gather broad demographic information, as well as to protect against fraud. We track IP addresses on all order forms for this reason.
Our site uses cookies to keep track of your user log in. We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests, possibly to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site, and for other purposes such as for affiliate tracking and site membership where applicable.
Our site's registration form may require users to give us contact information (like their name and email address) and in some instances, unique identifiers (like their social security number). We may use customer contact information from the registration form to send the user information about our company and promotional material in the form of newsletter or website ads. We do not share our client's private information with our partners or any advertisers.
The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings. Opt Out information is on every mailing we send.
Log Files
As with most other websites, we collect and use the data contained in log files. The information in the log files include your IP (internet protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider, such as AOL or Shaw Cable), the browser you used to visit our site (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox), the time you visited our site and which pages you visited throughout our site.
Cookies and Web Beacons
We do use cookies to store information, such as your personal preferences when you visit our site. This could include only showing you a popup once in your visit, or the ability to login to some of our features, such as forums. We do not use any web beacons on our website.
Our site contains advertising which is paid for by our sponsors. While we request that our advertisers adhere to strict privacy policies, we have no control over their use of your private information if you choose to supply it to them.
This site contains links to other sites. DIME Consultants Inc. is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites outside of the DIME Consultants ownership. (See  Terms of Use.)
Our site may use an order form for customers to request information, products, and services. We collect visitor's contact information (like their name and email address). We will NEVER ask for your financial information (like credit card numbers). Â  Our advertisers and customers who purchase from us, do so securely via our third party processing systems such as Paypal and 2Checkout, both of which utilize their own security systems, keeping your payment information completely confidential.
Contact information from the order form is used to process orders and verify for fraud protection. The customer's contact information is used to get in touch with the visitor when necessary, but is not sold, rented or traded.
Our online surveys may ask visitors for contact information (like their email address) and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level).
We use contact data from our surveys to send the user information about our company and promotional material from some of our partners. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary. However, we never release this information to any public entity.
Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We may use this data to tailor our visitor's experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences.
SECURITY
This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.
