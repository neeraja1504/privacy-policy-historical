Cookies
Cookies are small data files that are sent from our servers to your computer during a browsing session. In order to make our site more responsive to the needs of our visitors, we may use cookies to assign your Internet browser a unique random number, a sort of anonymous user ID that is stored in a file on your computer. By using a cookie, we are able to automatically identify your browser and track your use of our site.

Personally Identifiable Information
Other than information you supply on our forums or other discussion areas and as described in the next three paragraphs, we do not sell, rent, loan, or otherwise share personally identifiable information, including email lists, to third parties. You need not take any action to prevent such disclosure.
We may share all of the kinds of nonpublic personal information we collect with:
Third Parties
In connection with, or as may be necessary to service or process a product or service requested or authorized by you, or to effect, administer, or enforce a transaction requested or authorized by you.
Service providers, including those providing marketing services (such as mailing, events management, marketing analysis, and similar services), compliance services, accounting, institutional brokerage services, transaction processing, and systems support.
Third parties may include data processing companies, compliance support organizations, and marketing organizations.
Affiliates
We may provide all of the nonpublic personal information we collect about you to our affiliates to enable them or enhance our ability to offer you new or additional products or services, improve the quality of the products and services we currently offer to you, and to aid us and them in the assessment of our existing products and services and the development of new products or services.
Affiliates may include providers of systems support and services, and compliance services.
We may be required by law, court order, governmental agency, or law enforcement authority to disclose your personally identifiable information.

We do not combine personally identifiable information with any of the non-personally identifiable information gathered on the public portions of our sites.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information
We compile and analyze non-personally identifiable information on an aggregated basis. But because we do not know their names or addresses, they are anonymous to us. We may also use this information to conduct internal research on our visitors' demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand and serve our visitors.
