_ Defined Terms_
The following terms used in this Privacy Policy have defined meanings.
Personal information/data
Personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (“data subject”). An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.
Data subject
The data subject is an identified or identifiable natural person, whose personal data is processed by the controller responsible for the processing.
Processing
Processing is any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.
Restriction of Processing
Restriction of processing is the marking of stored personal data with the aim of limiting their processing in the future.
Profiling
Profiling means any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person's performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements.
Pseudonymisation
Pseudonymisation is the processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person.

Controller or controller responsible for the processing is the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or another body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law.
Processor
The processor is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or another body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller.
Recipient
The recipient is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or another body, to which the personal data are disclosed, whether a third party or not. However, public authorities which may receive personal data in the framework of a particular inquiry in accordance with Union or Member State law shall not be regarded as recipients; the processing of those data by those public authorities shall be in compliance with the applicable data protection rules according to the purposes of the processing.
Third party
The third party is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or body other than the data subject, controller, processor and persons who, under the direct authority of the controller or processor, are authorized to process personal data.
Consent
Consent of the data subject is any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her.

_ Data storage, transfer, retention, and deletion_
Where is  my Information stored?
Information submitted to the Service will be transferred to, processed, and stored in the United States and/or the Europen Union. When you use the Software on your computing device, User Content you save will be stored locally on that device and synced with our servers. If you post or transfer any Information to or through our Site, Software, and/or Services, you are agreeing to such Information, including Personal Data and User Content, being hosted and accessed in the United States and/or the Europen Union.
How secure is  my Information?
The Service is committed to protecting the security of your Information and takes reasonable precautions to protect it. However, Internet data transmissions, whether wired or wireless, cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and as a result, we cannot ensure the security of Information you transmit to us, including Personal Data and User Content; accordingly, you acknowledge that you do so at your own risk.
We use industry-standard encryption to protect your data in transit. This is commonly referred to as transport layer security (“TLS”) or secure socket layer (“SSL”) technology.
Once we receive your data, we protect it on our servers using a combination of technical, physical, and logical security safeguards. The security of the data stored locally in any of our Software installed on your computing device requires that you make use of the security features of your device. We recommend that you take the appropriate steps to secure all computing devices that you use in connection with our Site, Software, and Service.
If the Service learns of a security system breach, we may attempt to notify you and provide information on protective steps, if available, through the email address that you have provided to us or by posting a notice on the Site. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive such notices in writing.
The Service uses appropriate technical and organisational measures for your rights and freedoms, taking into account the nature, scope, circumstances and purposes of the processing as well as the different probability of occurrence and severity of the risks, in order to be able to ensure that the data processing takes place in accordance with the statutory provisions.
How can I delete my Personal Data from the Service?
You can remove your Personal Data from the Service at any time by logging into your account, accessing the Settings page, and then deleting your account. The User Content you submitted to the Service, such as posts, videos, and comments, will still be available to the public and stored on our servers though but will be transferred to an anonymous account.
How long is Personal Data retained?
You can remove your Personal Data from the Service at any time by deleting your account as described above. However, we may keep some of your Personal Data for as long as reasonably necessary for our legitimate business interests, including fraud detection and prevention and to comply with our legal obligations including tax, legal reporting, and auditing obligations.
What happens if  the Service closes my account?
If the Service closes your account due to your violation of the Terms of Service or Community Guidelines, then you may contact the Service to request deletion of your data. The Service will evaluate such requests on a case by case basis, pursuant to our legal obligations.
_ For EEA users_
The Service uses, processes, and stores Personal Data and User Content, including those listed in the "What Information does the Service collect about me?" section, as necessary to perform our agreement with you, and based on our legitimate interests in order to provide the Service. We rely on your consent to process Personal Data to send promotional emails and to place cookies on your devices. In some cases, the Service may process Personal Data pursuant to a legal obligation or to protect your vital interests or those of another person.

Please note you will continue to receive transactional messages related to our Service, even if you unsubscribe from marketing or newsletter emails.

_ Will this Privacy Policy ever change?_
As the Service evolves, we may need to update this Policy to keep pace with changes in our Service and Site, our business, and laws applicable to us and you. We will, however, always maintain our commitment to respect your privacy. We will notify you of any material changes that impact your rights under this Policy by email (to your most recently provided email address) or post any other revisions to this Policy, along with their effective date, in an easy-to-find area of the Site, so we recommend that you periodically check back here to stay informed of any changes.

_ Legal bases_
The legal regulations for data protection can be found in particular in the Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) and the Telemedia Act (TMG). From 25 May 2018, however, the Basic Data Protection Ordinance (DSGVO) will take precedence. Insofar as you have given your express consent to the processing of your data, this is also the legal basis for data processing for the purposes to which you have consented (Art. 6 para. 1 letter a DSGVO).
Insofar as the processing is necessary for the performance or initiation of a contract, this constitutes the legal basis (Art. 6 para. 1 letter b DSGVO). These are usage contracts concluded between you and the operator or initiated upon your request. Furthermore, the legal basis for data processing is the protection of the legitimate interests of the operator (Art. 6 para. letter f DSGVO).
This is the economic interest in the operation of the platform, in particular in the delivery of target group- and interest-oriented advertising. There is no automated decision making including profiling within the meaning of Art. 22 DSGVO. In particular, the assignment to advertising features has no legal effect on you or significantly impairs it in a similar manner.
