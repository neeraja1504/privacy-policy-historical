This Privacy Policy discloses the self-regulated privacy practices of Excelligence Learning Corporation (Excelligence®), sole owner of DiscountSchoolSupply.com. By posting this policy, we want you to understand what information we gather about you, how we use it, and the safeguards we have in place to protect it.
If you have questions/comments regarding this posted Privacy Policy, please contact our Webmaster:
Webmaster@DiscountSchoolSupply.com (Subject: Privacy Policy Question).Information Collection and Use
Excelligence® Learning Corporation is the sole owner of the information collected on this website. We collect information from site users at several different places on this site. Other than as disclosed in this policy, we will not sell or rent this information or share it with a third party.
We may collect personal information about you on this site to service your account and to personalize your experience. For example, we may collect your name, mailing address, email address, telephone number, or credit card number when you voluntarily submit the information to us during the checkout process or when you request a catalog via our site.
We use your information to process and complete your order and to inform you of your order status. We also use your information to register you as a user of our site or to provide you with services, such as access to your order history. We also collect personal information from you if you choose to subscribe to our emails or participate in giveaways, contests, surveys, or in connection with comments, activity ideas or other content you post on our site.
We may also collect information about you, such as the size of your classroom, how often you purchase certain items, etc., that you provide to us on our site. Non-personally-identifiable information may also be collected from you through “cookies” and “pixel tags,” which are explained in the next section of this Privacy Policy.
In addition, we may collect demographic information about you from third parties, such as your USPS postal address designation. We use this information to provide you with the most appropriate services and relevant offers from us.
Cookies and Pixel Tags
A “pixel tag” is a clear GIF image used in combination with cookies to pass measured information to a third party.
Cookies are a repository of measured values set on your computer to monitor your behavior while visiting the web site. The cookies are required for personalization features and for our shopping cart and checkout to function properly.
By allowing cookies, you allow us to preserve some of your account information, including your zip code and your customer ID. Cookies save you time when using our website in the future because they allow us to recognize you when you return to our site and to provide you with a personalized experience that we feel will be of value to you. The cookies that are configured by our website do not contain any personally- identifying information, such as your name or your credit card number.
We and our third-party service providers use cookies on our site to identify, for example, your IP address, type of browser, and specific web pages through which you click. This data is collected automatically and is used to help us look for ways to improve our site and your experience on it.
Information Security
We take safety measures to safeguard your personal information. When you submit sensitive information through our website, the information is protected both online and off-line.
When our registration/order form asks you to enter sensitive information (such as name, address, or credit card number), that information is encrypted and protected with the current industry standard encryption protocol known as “secure socket layer” or “SSL.” While on a secure page, such as our order form, a lock icon (as shown here ) appears on the bottom or top of your web browsers. Secure web pages also have URL’s (Uniform Resource Locator) that start with https:// instead of http://. To learn more about SSL, visit
http://www.verisign.com/.
In addition to using SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also take reasonable measures to protect your information off-line. Other than information that is shared (as described in the “Sharing Information” section below), your personally-identifiable information referenced above is restricted in our offices. Within our offices, access to your information is granted to our employees/auditors for the sole purpose of performing specific jobs that relate to our business. (For example, a personal service manager may need to access your contact information.) Employees are instructed on the importance we place on privacy, and when new policies are implemented, we stress the steps employees should take to ensure that our customers’ information is safeguarded. Finally, the servers on which we store personal information are kept in a secure environment, accessible only to authorized employees.
We also work with security company, McAfee® to add an additional layer to our security protocol. McAfee SECURE™ scans the Discount School Supply website daily and, after it is determined the site is safe and secure, posts its seal of approval with the date of the last scan. Look for the McAfee SECURE™ seal the next time you place an order.
If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to
Webmaster@DiscountSchoolSupply.com (Subject: Security Question). Sharing Information
We do not share your personally-identifiable information with outside marketers except as described in this section. We may share your information with our partners to enhance your experience. (For example, through our partnerships with other companies, you may receive information or offers regarding products or services in which you have previously expressed an interest and/or selected promotional offers that may be of interest to you.) Excelligence’s partners include all Excelligence® affiliates as well as other selected companies with which Excelligence® or its affiliates have a business relationship. These selected businesses use commercially-strict standards for providing quality products and services, responding to your needs, and safeguarding customer information. If you prefer that we do not share your name and address with our partners, please send an email to noshare@excelligence.com (Subject: Do Not Share).
In certain circumstances, we may share your information with service providers, such as PayPal, only when such access is necessary to provide operational or other support services. Those service providers agree to maintain confidentiality and security of your information.
Excelligence® may also provide information to regulatory authorities and law enforcement officials in accordance with applicable law or when we otherwise believe in good faith that the law requires it. In some instances, we may access or disclose your information to protect or defend our own legal rights, to guard against fraud, and/or to protect the safety and security of other customers/users.
Analytics & Insights
Excelligence® partners with third-party analytics service providers like Google Analytics to collect visitation information from its websites and/or apps and associate this information with Google information from accounts of signed-in users who have consented to this association for the purpose of ads personalization. This Google information and data may be accessed and/or deleted by end users anytime via My Activity. These features are also subject to the Google Analytics Advertising Features policies. Online Ad Serving
Excelligence® partners with third-party advertising service providers known as Ad Networks to distribute ads on our behalf across the Internet. To facilitate the delivery of advertisements that may be of particular interest to you, we permit Ad Networks to collect anonymous information about your visits to our website and other websites using cookies and pixel tags (also called web beacons). No sensitive or personal information (including name, phone number, address, and email address) is collected or shared with Ad Networks by Excelligence® during this process. To find out more about how the networks manage the privacy of information in conjunction with delivering ads online, please visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/participating the Network Advertising Initiative website, which offers useful information about Ad Networks, including information about how to opt-out of their information collections.
