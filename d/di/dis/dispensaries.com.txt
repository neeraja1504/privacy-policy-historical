From time to time, we may use the standard “cookies” feature of major browser applications that allows us to store a small piece of data on your computer that tracks information about your visit to our Services. We do not set any personally identifiable information in cookies. Cookies help us customize your content experience (for example to store your password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you use the Services) and to learn which areas of our Services are useful and which areas need improvement. Our business partners (advertisers) may use cookies on our Services. We have no access to or control over these cookies once our business partners have been given permission to set cookies. This Policy covers the use of cookies by us only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings on your browser.
