Certain countries and regions (i.e., the EU) require that You provide consent for cookies that are not strictly necessary, which can be managed through Your “Cookie Settings” link on the Service in those locations.
Performance cookies allow us to analyze how users use the Service and infer Your general location (country-level), preferences, interests, and online behavior to improve Our Service by providing more relevant content based on analytics results.
Targeting cookies allow us to target advertisements to You based on Your inferred location (country-level), preferences, interests, and online behavior.
Social media cookies are used to indicate a “like” or other action to content on social media.
Cookies may also provide information to Us about Your online interaction with other sites and provide information to other sites about Your online interaction with Us. The collection and use of information by companies placing cookies is governed by the relevant company’s privacy policy and is not covered by this Policy. You have rights regarding Our use of cookies. Please see the Cookie and Internet Advertising Policy for more information about Your cookie options.  We do not participate in any automated decision making, such as profiling (other than for cookie-based targeted marketing), with regards to the Service and Your personal information.
INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE
We share personal information with service providers (processors) that act as an agent to perform tasks on Our behalf and under Our instructions. Examples include providers that assist with payment processing (i.e., PayPal), shipping (i.e., USPS), or providers that We contract with to send emails on Our behalf (i.e., MailChimp). If You process payments through Discogs Payments, in the U.S., You will be contracting for this service directly with Zink Media, LLC (d/b/a Discogs), and in the EU, You will be contracting for this service directly with Discogs B.V. sending emails on Our behalf, and fulfilling orders. In both cases, the payment processor working on Our behalf is Adyen B.V. This information is limited only to the information needed to perform the tasks.  If certain cookies are enabled on Your device, then We may also share cookie-related information with related service providers, such as analytics and advertising providers or social media companies. Additional information about the service providers/processors We use to support delivery of Our Service is set forth at Processors List.  For additional information about service provider (processor) and third party privacy practices, please review those partes’ privacy policies and notices.
We will provide You with notice in the event We intend to share Your information with a third party (other than as described above) or for a purpose that is materially different from the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by You. Prior to sharing such information, You will be provided with clear, conspicuous, and readily available mechanisms to opt in or out of such sharing, as required by applicable laws and regulations.  Except as described in this Policy, We do not otherwise share Your information with any third parties without Your consent.  We do not provide or sell email addresses or collection/wantlist information to any third party without Your consent.  Registered users can control the public availability of their collection/wantlist information in the account settings.  Please see “Notification and Other Privacy Preferences” below for additional information on limiting the sharing of Your information.
Affiliates : We may share information with domestic and foreign affiliates controlling or controlled by Us, including Meta Zink Corporation, Discogs B.V., Discogs G.K., and NearMint, LLC, in order to provide the Service. Our affiliates are subject to the terms of this Policy and follow the same privacy practices as Us. Zink Media, LLC is the primary Data Controller for personal information collected and processed through Our and Our affiliates’ sites and services. All sharing is subject to the Privacy Shield frameworks noted above and an intercompany data processing agreement.
Cookies : We may share information with advertising companies to serve You targeted advertisements, analytics providers, or social media providers.  This sharing is considered a “sale” under the California Consumer Privacy Act. You must be 16 years of age or older to use the Service. As a result, We do not sell personal information of consumers under 16 years of age.  The information is sourced from cookies/tags placed on Your device. The categories of information shared include:
Geolocation Information: Non-precise geolocation data based on Your IP address or other analytics tools.
Inferred Information: Inferences drawn from your online activities reflecting Your preferences, behavior, and interests.
Depending on your location, you may need to opt in/consent to the placement of these and other cookies or you may have the option to opt out of these and other cookies.  Please see the Cookie and Internet Advertising Policy for additional information about controlling cookies.
In addition to the above cookie-related actions, California consumers may select the “ Do Not Sell My Personal Information ” link, which has been included on Our sites as a component of California Consumer Privacy Act compliance to block targeted advertising, analytics, and social media cookies upon Your request.  See “California Disclosures” below for additional information.
Other Sharing : We may share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Our Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law enforcement or national security requirements. We may also disclose information when requested to comply with a court order, regulatory investigation, or governmental request.
Sensitive/Protected Information : We do not currently collect or process sensitive, special, or protected information.  In the event We decide to collect sensitive, special, or protected categories of information (i.e., personal information specifying medical or health conditions, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership or information specifying the sex life of the individual), We will first obtain affirmative express consent (opt in) from You if We intend such information to be disclosed to a third party or used for a purpose other than those for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by You through the exercise of an opt in choice.  You will have the ability to opt out at any time.
Nevada, United States, Residents : We do not sell Your personal information for monetary consideration as set forth in Nevada Senate Bill 220. If We change this practice in the future, We will obtain affirmative express consent (opt in) from You before taking any such action.  You can write to Us at Our Help Center to add Your email address to a “do not sell” list.  Please note that You are responsible for updating Us in the event that You need to change Your email address on file.

Physical access controls, including secured premises to prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to personal information, and ensuring that off-site data centers and server facilities adhere to similar appropriate controls;
System access controls to prevent unauthorized access and use of personal information, which vary based on the nature of information processing, but may include: industry standard firewalls, authentication via hashed and salted passwords;
Data access controls to ensure personal information is accessible and manageable only by properly authorized staff, including restricted catalogue query and application access, need-to-know access restrictions, and restrictions on the personal information that can be read, copied, modified and/or removed;
Transmission controls, including encrypted data transfer over SSL and other controls to ensure that personal information cannot be read, copied, modified or removed without authorization during electronic transmission or transport;
Input controls to ensure that any personal information is provided and edited by You or by Us at Your direction;
Data backups are taken on a regular basis, and are secured and encrypted;
Logical separation to ensure that personal information is only processed per the terms of this Privacy Policy and the privacy settings selected by You.
Despite Our efforts, no security measure can be absolute, and there can be no guarantee that Your personal information will not be accessed through malicious means, inadvertent disclosure, or mistake. If We are the source of a breach, We will contact You and describe the breach, along with Our mitigation actions. Where applicable, We will provide appropriate identity theft prevention and mitigation services at no cost to the affected person for not less than 12 months.
TRANSFER OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
Privacy and data protection laws and regulations and their associated transfer requirements vary by location (state, country and region).  We strive to comply with transfers of personal information under these laws and regulations by ensuring transfer is made under an appropriate legal basis.  We only transfer personal information to those parties that act as service providers or processors with respect to the Service We provide to You, with your consent, or under a legitimate interest or business, or commercial purpose, as described in this Policy.  We may also transfer personal information if required to do so by other applicable laws and regulations, including those related to criminal or civil matters.
Our technical infrastructure is located in the United States.  If you choose to use the Service, you agree to Our Terms of Service which states that Your personal information will be hosted within Our United States infrastructure and Your personal information is required to be transferred to the United States as a result.
To the extent that We transfer Your personal information outside of Your country of residence, We rely on the following mechanisms to ensure the security of that information:
EU-US Privacy Shield and Swiss-US Privacy Shield
Data Processing Agreements
Model Clauses (EU standard contractual clauses)
EU Adequacy Decisions
Intercompany Data Transfer Agreement (among Our affiliates)
In the event that We go through a business transfer such as a consolidation, merger, restructuring, acquisition, or sale of part or all of Our assets, We will obtain Your consent to the transfer of Your information as permitted by law and to the continued use of Your information by the recipient following the transfer so long as they comply with this Policy.
