Aggregated Information
Aggregated information, such as which page users access or visit, and information volunteered by users is collected through various methods. For example, SavingStory collects IP addresses; an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web.

SavingStory only uses IP addresses for the purposes of Web traffic analysis and trends.
