Privacy | Admedo
Updated  on May 17th, 2018
Hi.
We’re Admedo.
We want to make advertising easier for everyone. And that includes people being advertised to. Like you.
Advertising is an important part of the internet. It’s one of the ways you find out about things you might be interested in: a new model of car or a book, a TV show or movie. It’s also how a lot of websites and apps you use make money to pay their staff, without asking it from you directly.
Without advertising your favourite websites might no longer be free. They might not exist at all.
When they’re good, ads can be very clever. They can be funny and memorable, and even useful – like when you had no idea what to do for Mother’s Day, and saw an ad for a hot air balloon ride.
But we all know advertising can be really annoying. It can also be creepy or inappropriate, or be downright disgusting.
Advertising online is also tricky, because it involves a lot of data. And recently there’s been news about how data can go really wrong.
So we’re going to tell you everything: about the data we collect, what we do with it, and what you can do about it.
In this privacy policy (“Policy”), we use the terms “Admedo“, “our“, “us” and “we” to refer to Admedo Ltd. and our affiliates. We use the term “Platform” to refer to our advertising technology tools and services, which allows our customers the ability to book and optimise advertising campaigns, and make automated buying decisions that efficiently spend their money. We use the term “Website” to refer to “www.admedo.com”, and we use the terms “users”, “you” and “your” to refer to consumers of our platform, services and sites.
This Policy explains how Admedo processes data in our Platform and Website for our users. It also explains what we do with the data, how we secure it, and explains the rights that users have as regards how we collect and process their data.
Admedo is committed to respecting and protecting the privacy of consumers when we process their information. We adhere to applicable industry guideline and strive to best practices. We will continue to review and update our Policy and procedures to ensure the safety and protection of personal information.

The lawful basis by which we are permitted to use this Information
Under data protection law the uses of information described above are all “legitimate interests” of ours or of others, which we have carefully considered and determined are not overridden by the interests, rights or freedoms of affected individuals (such as you). We need to carry out processing of your information in these ways for the purposes of meeting those interests. In determining this and assessing your rights, we consider a number of factors, such as what you were told at the time you provided your data, what your expectations are about the processing of the data, the nature of the data, and the impact of the processing on you.
In addition, we are permitted by law to use your information where you have given us explicit consent to the processing of your data for one or more specific purposes, namely for marketing purposes.

Other Important Details
Securing Data
We use technical and organisational measures to protect personal data from unauthorised access. These may include encryption and other information security technologies, applied to our networks and systems. However, no mechanism for either storing data, or transmitting data over the Internet, is completely secure. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee the safety or security of any information you transmit to us.
Admedo processes information in a way that is aligned with the purposes for which it was collected. To the extent necessary for those purposes, we take reasonable steps to ensure that any information in our care is accurate, complete, current, and reliable for its intended use.
Moving Data Around
The information that we collect from you and about you may be transferred to and stored in a country other than your country of residence, such as another European country or the USA, which may not offer the same level of protection of personal information as your country of residence.
Where your personal data is being transferred outside the EU, we will either undertake an assessment of the level of protection in light of the circumstances surrounding the transfer or:
Only transfer it to a non-EEA country with privacy laws that give the same protection as the EEA; or
Ensure we have an agreement in place with the recipient under which they are under a duty to protect your data to the same standards as those in place in the EEA; or
Transfer it to US organisations that are signed up to the EU-US Privacy Shield scheme; or
We will make sure that any transfers are not repetitive and only limited to the minimum amount of information possible. In certain circumstances we may need to seek your consent unless there is an overriding legal need to transfer the information]; and
In all cases where your information is transferred outside the EEA, you have a right to contact us for a copy of the measures we have put in place, by email to [email protected]
How Long We Keep Data
We retain the cookie ID for as long as this is necessary for our legitimate business purposes.
Cookies set via the Platform expire within 13 months of setting. Browsing activity associated with an Admedo cookie expires within the lesser of: 60 days of last known activity and 13 months of setting.
Our log level data is cleansed of any personal data, such as IP address within three days of being produced as a result of interaction with a third party web page we are partnered with, or after being served with an advert via the Admedo platform.
Children
Our Platform and services are designed and directed to individuals of 16 years of age or older. We do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 16. If we are made aware that we have received personal information from someone under 16, we will use reasonable efforts to remove that information from our records.
We do not market by email or other electronic means to children under the age of 16 anywhere.
In adherence to EDAA requirements, we do not create segments for OBA purposes that are specifically designed to target children (age 12 and under). While this does not mean that ad delivery will not occur, it means that we will not specifically target ads to children ages 12 and under.
Your Rights
Opting out
Personalised ads, sometimes referred to as targeted or interest-based ads, are based on information about you, such as the products you view online, visits to websites where we provide ads or content.

Please note that even if you choose above not to see personalised ads, you may still see ads provided by Admedo on websites; they will just not be personalised.
Choosing not to see personalised ads, changing your recommendations and opting out of your browsing history will not affect other services that use the same technology, such as cookies, and information may still be collected for other purposes. You can manage cookies in the privacy settings on the web browser you are using.
Please also note that these cookies are set on a per browser basis. If you use multiple browsers or devices, you will need to repeat this task on each device and browser.

An EU or Swiss individual who would like to access, correct, change or delete inaccurate data about themselves, can send a request to [email protected], and we will respond to your request within 30 days.
Moving your information to another organisation
In the event that we process your data by automated means where you have either provided us with consent for us to use your information or where we used the information to perform a contract with you, you have the right to request that we send to you or to another organisation, a copy of the personal data we hold about you, for example when you are dealing with a different service provider. If you would like us to move, copy, or transfer your information please let us know by email to [email protected] We will respond to you within one month after assessing whether or not this is possible, taking into account the technical compatibility with the other organisation in question.
How you can request erasure of your data
You can ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where you have withdrawn consent for us to process it (as explained below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law.

How you can withdraw your consent
You have the right at any time to withdraw any explicit consent you have given us to process your personal data.

How you can restrict or object to us using your data
You can ask us to suspend the way in which we are using your information in certain scenarios, or object to our processing your data where we are relying on a legitimate interest ground (or those of a third party) and you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms, or where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases where you object, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
Please note that if you want us to restrict or stop processing your data this may impact on our ability to provide our services. Depending on the extent of your request we may be unable to continue providing you with our service.
Any queries or concerns about the way in which your data is being used can be sent to [email protected]
Changes to the Policy
From time to time we may revise this Policy. The date of the last update can be found at the top of this Policy. If we make revisions that materially change or affect whether or how we collect or use personal information, we will notify you and we’ll indicate when such changes will become effective. Such a notification might be a message on our website or an email sent to you (if you have provided us your email address as a user of our service or Platform) in advance of the changes taking effect.
