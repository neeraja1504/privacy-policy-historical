But you can opt out of non-administrative emails such as digests, newsletters, and activity notifications through your account.
When you interact with an email sent from discountwalas.com (such as opening an email or clicking on a particular link in an email), we may receive information about that interaction.

Google Login
1. Discountwalas
In order to provide a customized user experience with regards deals, discounts and product purchases across e-commerce platforms, we would be requiring support of the Gmail API. We intend to provide e-mail support to users to aggregate their online purchases, which would involve use of features like mail merge, package delivery updates, etc.
Keeping such mails away from the Spam folder would be of utmost importance. We would be explaining our users the need for their Gmail account access to ensure that our mails are never deleted by mistake or are never left unread if they land in their spam folder.
2. We have multiple websites ranging from Business News, Motivational website, Latest coupon deals, Astrology etc. which makes social profiling of our user base extremely important. Separate authentication shall be done for each website post which information can be personalized to create a custom user experience.
Through these multiple websites there would be significant interchange of data between Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Drive, Google Analytics and Youtube for which we intend to develop a CRM tool.
Since all websites will have an interconnected user base, keeping them logged in though a single Gmail login would immensely help us. We would be explaining our users the need for their Gmail account access to ensure that our mails are never deleted by mistake or are never left unread if they land in their spam folder.
