Users may use Emediate ad serving technology when they visit websites or advertisers using Emediates ad serving technology (EAS). Emediate asks all clients using our ad serving technology to disclose their relationship with us by providing notice to consumers about the Emediate technologies.

Those companies act as our agents and are bound to use the information only for the purposes for which Emediate has shared the information.
