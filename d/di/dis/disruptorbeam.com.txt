This Privacy Policy applies to your use of the Disruptor Beam Sites and Services, unless a particular Service contains or links to a separate Privacy Policy. This privacy policy describes how Disruptor Beam collects, uses, shares and secures the personal information you provide. It also describes your choices regarding the use, access and correction of your personal information.
Disruptor Beam respects the privacy of its online visitors and users of the Disruptor Beam Sites and Services. Disruptor Beam recognizes the importance of protecting certain information collected from users and has adopted this Privacy Policy that guides how Disruptor Beam collects, stores, and uses information provided from users through the Disruptor Beam Sites and Services as described below. This policy is current as of its last revision date indicated above.

EU-U.S. Privacy Shield
Disruptor Beam and its subsidiary company Disruptor Beam UK Ltd participates in and has certified its compliance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework.  Disruptor Beam is committed to subjecting all personal data received from European Union (EU) member countries, in reliance on the Privacy Shield Framework, to the Framework’s applicable Principles.  To learn more about the Privacy Shield Framework, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield List. [https://www.privacyshield.gov/list]
Disruptor Beam is responsible for the processing of personal data it receives, under the Privacy Shield Framework, and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf.  Disruptor Beam complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU, including the onward transfer liability provisions.
With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, Disruptor Beam is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.  In certain situations, Disruptor Beam may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request.
Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website [https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint], you may invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.
Collection, Use and Disclosure of Information
When you use any Service through a third party Social networking service such as Facebook, Kongregate, Apple GameCenter or Google Play (each, an “SNS”), you allow Disruptor Beam to access certain information from your profile for that SNS. The information you allow Disruptor Beam to access varies by Service and SNS, and it is affected by the privacy settings you and your friends establish at the SNS. You can control and find out more about these settings at the SNS where you play our games. For example, Disruptor Beam may access and store some or all of the following information, as allowed by you, the SNS and your preferences:
your first and last name
your profile picture or its URL
your user ID number, which is linked to publicly available information such as name and profile photo
the user ID numbers and other public data for your friends
the login e-mail you provided to that SNS when you registered
your gender
your birthday
other information the SNS provides to Disruptor Beam through its Application Programming Interface
When you interact with the Services (whether or not through an SNS), at any Disruptor Beam Site, We may collect and store information from you directly as described below.
Disruptor Beam may collect and share with other parties aggregate information and device-related information gathered by Disruptor Beam in the course of your use of the Disruptor Beam Sites and Services. "Aggregate information" is information that describes the habits, usage patterns, and demographics of users as a group but does not describe or reveal the identity of any particular user. "Device-related information" is information about a user that is presented in a form distinguishable from information relating to other users, but not in a form that personally identifies contact and/or billing information for any user, or enables the recipient to communicate directly with any user unless agreed to by the user in advance of such communication (such as the device ID of your mobile device). Aggregate information and/or device-related information may be used by Disruptor Beam for any purpose, including, without limitation, to improve the Disruptor Beam Sites and Services, for internal marketing studies, or simply to collect demographic information about Disruptor Beam's users.
Disruptor Beam may use contact information provided by users to send information about (i) Disruptor Beam and the Disruptor Beam Sites and Services for which you subscribed or otherwise used or accessed, including, without limitation, news about product updates, contests, events, and other promotional materials, and (ii) only if the users agree to receive such communications, for unrelated products or services. "Personal information" is information that permits a recipient to identify you as an individual, any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ('data subject'); an identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to his physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity, including but not limited to your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, and credit card information. While Disruptor Beam collects personal information on a voluntary basis for the use of the Disruptor Beam Sites and Services, Disruptor Beam's collection of personal information may be a requirement for access to certain parts of the Disruptor Beam Sites or Services. We may collect personal information from you from a variety of ways, including, without limitation, when you (a) make an online purchase from the Disruptor Beam Sites, (b) register to become a member or user of the Disruptor Beam Sites and Services, (c) voluntarily provide it when you use the Disruptor Beam Sites and Services, (d) disclose it in a public area of the Disruptor Beam Site and Services, or (e) provide it when you communicate with Us.
If you make an online purchase or register to become a member or user of the Disruptor Beam Sites and Services, We may use the personal information that you provide in connection with such purchase for shipping and billing purposes, to administer and manage your account, or provide promotional updates regarding such Disruptor Beam Sites and Services as contemplated above. In addition, We may send out periodic e-mails informing you of technical or security issues related to the Disruptor Beam Sites and Services you requested, confirming you requested a product or service, or providing periodic updates or information relating to the Disruptor Beam Sites and Services you requested. Except in the cases described below, Disruptor Beam will not share personal information with any third-party unless the user agrees to such disclosure in advance.
We may provide the option to register to receive SMS notifications to your mobile phone regarding the Services that you use. If you sign up to have SMS notifications sent directly to your mobile phone We will receive and store the information you provide, including your telephone number. These messages may notify you of in-game activity and may allow you to use the Service from your phone.
Mobile Applications
When you download and use our Services, we automatically collect information on the type of device you use, operating system version, and the device identifier (or “UDID”).
With your consent We may also send push notifications to your mobile device to provide game updates and other relevant messages. You can manage push notifications from the “options” or “settings” page within the relevant Service. You may also be able to manage them from your device’s settings page for the relevant Service. We may send local notifications to your mobile device to provide game updates and other relevant information. You can manage local notifications from the “options” or “settings” page within the relevant Service.
We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our Mobile Software on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from. We do not link information we store within the analytics software to any personal information you submit within the application.
Information Sharing
Disruptor Beam may occasionally instruct other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including, without limitation, packaging, mailing and delivering purchases, answering customer questions about products or services, sending postal mail, providing billing and collection services, conducting customer surveys, and processing event registration. We will only provide these companies the information reasonably required to perform the applicable service, and they will be prohibited from using that information for any other purpose. When these companies collect and/or have access to the personal information you provide, We require that they protect the confidentiality of personal information they collect or have access to in the course of their engagement by Disruptor Beam. Also, in certain cases, your personal information may be collected directly by our authorized distributors, sublicensees or subcontractors in connection with certain products or services made available through web sites operated by such companies. In these cases, the privacy policies of such companies will apply rather than Disruptor Beam's policy. If providing the information is a requirement of usage, the user may elect to decline to use that particular product or service.
Disruptor Beam may elect to share personal information of users with certain business partners for marketing or other similar purposes, but only if the users agree to share such information. In such event, such partners will be prohibited from disclosing such information or using such information except for the limited purposes for which such users agree to share such information. Furthermore, third-party web sites and companies with links to and from the Disruptor Beam Sites and Services may collect personal information about users. You should be aware that these third-party web sites or links may have their own information collection practices and privacy policies. We do not control the privacy policies of third parties that have web sites linked to the Disruptor Beam Sites and Services. If you click on a third-party advertisement or link, the privacy policies of the third-party web site that you link to will govern the use of your information by that web site's operator. Disruptor Beam's Privacy Policy does not extend to these external web sites and companies. Please refer directly to these companies and web sites regarding their privacy policies. We assume no responsibility or liability for the actions of such third parties with respect to their use of your information or otherwise. Accordingly, please make sure you are aware of and comfortable with the privacy policies of any third-party web sites to which you follow a link.
Disruptor Beam may disclose your personal information or otherwise use such information to communicate with you if required or permitted to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process such as to comply with a subpoena or any governmental request; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Disruptor Beam or its affiliated companies, licensors or licensees; (c) enforce the Terms of Service or any applicable License Agreements; or (d) protect the personal safety or interests of Disruptor Beam employees, users of Disruptor Beam products or services, or members of the public in urgent circumstances.
In the event of a merger or consolidation of Disruptor Beam, or the sale of all or a portion of its stock or assets, or the transfer of the operation and distribution of certain products or services to a third party, or bankruptcy of Disruptor Beam, your personal information may be transferred to Disruptor Beam's successors or assigns resulting from such events to use for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.
Children Under The Age of 13
Our Sites and Services are not intended for children under the age of 13 and We do not knowingly collect any personal information from such children.
