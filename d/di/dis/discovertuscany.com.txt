Privacy Policy
Introduction: the GDPR and privacy
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a European Commission Regulation ( EU 2016/679) with which the European Union strengthens and standardizes the protection of private personal data of citizens and residents of the European Union, both within and outside its borders. This regulation replaces the laws of the individual Member States in terms of privacy and enters into force May 25, 2018.
For more details, you read the official text of the GDPR, visit Italy’s Data Protection Authority website and and the page on Wikipedia.
In accordance to the GDPR, this privacy statement serves to clearly and simply explain which personal data is collected through this site, where it is stored, for how long, with what purpose and how you can update it or request it deletion.
Who is the data controller: WebPromoter
DiscoverTuscany.com belongs to Webpromoter S.n.c. di S. Romeo & C. VAT# IT05515250487 to which we refer to later as “WebPromoter”.
WebPromoter is a private company based in Florence, with offices in via G.b. Vico 32 (Italy).
WebPromoter manages the site listed above and controls the management of personal data as described in this statement, in accordance with the current privacy laws ( General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) - EU Regulation 2016/679 ).
You can contact us by email at webpromoter@registerpec.it (PEC) or info@discovertuscany.com.
On what legal basis does WebPromoter collect and manage personal data?
WebPromoter uses as a legal basis the need to process personal data for the execution of its services, which include responding for requests for information on Tuscany, accommodation recommendations, itinerary help and general information on visiting the region. Without collecting the requested data on forms, it would not be possible for us to respond to the requests of the site user.
Webpromoter relies on its legitimate commercial interest to provide its services, promote them, prevent fraud and spam and improve its services.
Where required by applicable law, we ask for your consent before processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes.
What type of data does WebPromoter collect on DiscoverTuscany.com?
WebPromoter collects the information you send us through the contact forms on this site.
For users who request information, such data includes your name, email, website and telephone number, in addition to any other information you choose to add to your request.
The same form is used by anyone interested in promoting their services on our sites so the requested information is the same.
For each form sent, we collect data related to the browser and operating system used and the IP address, both of which serve to fight spam and to identify any usability problems on our sites in relation to particular browser settings and devices.
When you visit our site, we also automatically collect information related to your visit. Your IP address, the date and time of access to our site, hardware, software or browser you use and information about your computer's operating system and language settings is recorded. We also collect information about your clicks and the pages you've viewed on our sites, as well as information that tells us which sites or marketing campaigns you used to visit our sites.
Why does WebPromoter collect this data on DiscoverTuscany.com?
The data you send us through the form on our site are first of all used to provide the information you request.
Data sent through the form is collected to provide, through email or by phone, additional information and personalized offers for advertising on our sites. Only in the case of explicit consent would we use the data to send additional offers related to our sites aimed solely at service providers in Tuscany.
WebPromoter keeps a copy of requests in its archives for statistical purposes and as a backup.
WebPromoter sends an email confirming that the request has been correctly sent and this email may include additional information, including links to articles or offers on WebPromoter sites or partner sites. Only in the case of explicit consent would WebPromoter send further communications via email containing information and offers of interest for those planning a visit to Tuscany.
Finally, the data sent through compiled forms can be used to show you personalized online advertising campaigns (remarketing) rather than generic advertisements, through specialized platforms such as Google Adwords and Facebook Advertising. In this case, users of the sites are grouped into virtual lists, in aggregate form not traceable to individual users, based on the location of the accommodation facility (in the case of facility managers) or on the dates of planned stays, on the site and pages visited and the actions performed (such as sending a request or subscription to the newsletter). This information is to provide advertisements targeted to your interests rather than generic ads through advertising platforms such as Google and Facebook.
