Privacy Policy
Visitors to our Site
Visitors to our website (all pages within the directadmin.com domain) enjoy complete privacy when browsing our pages.  We do not track visitor activity with cookies nor retain any specific information about visitors.  IP addresses and pages viewed are logged for statistics purposes, but none of this logging activity can reveal information about a specific visitor.
Forum:
The forum (located at http://forum.directadmin.com ) is the only exception to the above statement.  The forum software (vBulletin) uses cookies to track visitor activity.  This allows returning visitors to isolate forum posts that have been created or replied to since their last visit.
Visitors registering on the forum are asked to provide information such as their name and e-mail address, along with other optional information (such as date of birth).  This information is used only for the purposes of forum activity and is not released to 3rd parties nor used for our own marketing purposes.  The only communication received as a result of the forum is when the visitor specifically requests that the forum software notify them of new threads and/or replied-to threads.  The visitor's e-mail address and other information is kept completely private and he/she will not received unsolicited communications of any kind.
Requests for Information:
Potential customers contacting us via any method (live chat, e-mail, support ticket, etc.) are guaranteed full privacy in their respective method of communication.  Information is not taken from chat sessions, e-mail enquiries, etc. and released to third parties, nor is it used for our own marketing purposes.  Chat transcripts and e-mail enquiries are kept on file, however, so we can better assist the same potential customer in the future.
Our Customers
Our customers are guaranteed complete privacy in all dealings and communications with us.
Communication:
Customers can contact us via several methods, each with varying levels of security.  We guarantee privacy across all these methods, but cannot guarantee absolute security.  For example, submitting sensitive information (e.g. passwords) via e-mail is less secure than submitting information through an SSL-protected ticket.
All information received from the customer is used exclusively for the purposes of supporting and administrating their account/license(s).  Customer information is not shared with any other party, nor is it used for our own marketing purposes.  Customers may occasionally receive bulk e-mail from us, but only in situations that relate specifically to their situation (e.g. notification of a serious security risk).
Client Accounts:
The client account is used to store information about the customer so he/she can order licenses quickly, without the need to re-enter personal details for each order.  Information in the client account is used only for this described purpose, and not for marketing of any kind.
Billing Information:
Information received as a result of billing (for example, billing address, phone number, credit card information, etc.) is used solely to process orders and validate licenses.  Information collected as a result of billing will not be used for any other purpose, including marketing.
