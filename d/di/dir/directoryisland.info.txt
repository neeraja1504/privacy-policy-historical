OUR PRIVACY POLICY
**
http://DirectoryIsland.info is absolutely committed to protecting the privacy of our online visitors. We collect basic information from online visitors who ask to be on our newsletter mailing list and/or receive periodic email announcements. Anyone who wishes can choose to be removed from our mailing list at any time.
You will deal with our automated emailer, not a salesperson. We will NEVER hard sell. Unless you specifically ask for a live person to respond, all emails will be from a computer. I understand that many people wish to remain anonymous... and not be haggled with. I understand that you do NOT want a hype-spewing salesperson contacting you and talking down to you.
** We respect your privacy. **
**
We will never sell, barter, rent, or give out your email address to anyone. We keep all information to ourselves. Like other Web sites, we collect information to enhance your visit and deliver more individualized content and advertising. We respect your privacy and do not share your information with anyone.
**
Our aim is to keep all information secure. In fact, we give tips on how to improve security. We offer reviews of the top SECURITY SOFTWARE: spyware, virus, trojan, firewall, etc. Also, we have a practical, easy to implement, attractive Verdana 12 font, NON-BORING security and self defense checklist manual that we publish.
This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Your profile is protected by all possible measures. We are constantly searching for the top security measures (software firewalls, hardware firewalls, etc.).

Internet Traffic Generator Ezine
Virus software.  McAfee Virus software. 'Here's something every online person should have...  Computer security software: Firewall. Now, if you are on a network/use a router...at least using my experience (as I have Zone Alarm's Firewall)...you may have to restart it every now and then. Oh, and the firewall is free to download. After 2 weeks you lose some features unless you upgrade.
