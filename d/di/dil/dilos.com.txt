Understanding your concerns over online purchases, we would like to assure you that it is our priority to ensure security over the transactions and confidentiality over your personal data. We hereby set out the basic principles of our privacy policy. Should you still have any concerns, you are encouraged to ask for clarifications. None of this information (your personal data) is either sold or leased by us to any third party.
What we collect
We collect information that you provide us at your own will, and such information does not usually go beyond the information that would be required for a direct booking with any hotel (i.e. name, full address, telephone, e-mail). Information is used by us in order to match each booking request with an individual, pass all necessary information to the hotel booked, issue an appropriate invoice and voucher, and secure payment of our services.
What we do with the information
Other than for booking purposes, we may ask for such information in some of our pages for the purchase of other services provided or for research/marketing, communication, membership or other purposes. In case you do not wish to be included in such mailing lists, if any, you have the option not to subscribe or to unsubscribe in case of an error or in case you change your mind.
We may also use this information to contact you before or when on a trip in order to inform you on serious events.
Furthermore, when you visit our site, we may collect statistical information about your visit. This information, which does not contain any personal data, will be used in order to evaluate and improve our site and services.
