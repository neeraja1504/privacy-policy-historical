Privacy Protection Procedures
Protecting your information is important to us. At OAR, we have implemented appropriate physical, technical and organizational measures to help keep your information secure, accurate, current, and complete. In addition, all OAR employees with access to personal information obtained on the OAR website are bound to adhere to this policy as part of their contract with OAR. OAR protects your personal information in a variety of ways. For certain services, such as Sign Up, only minimal personal information is required, such as email addresses. In addition, personal information provided to our donations sites is encrypted. We also protect that account information by placing it on a secure portion of our site that is only accessible by authorized personnel. All information provided to OAR’s donation site is transmitted using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption. SSL is a proven coding system that lets your browser automatically encrypt or scramble data before you send it to us. We also protect Hire Autism account information by placing it on a secure portion of our site that is only accessible by certain qualified OAR employees. If you choose, other Hire Autism users may view your personal profile information. Unfortunately however, no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of such information. Any such transmission is done at your own risk
