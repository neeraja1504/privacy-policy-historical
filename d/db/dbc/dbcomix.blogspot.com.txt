We do not actively collect sensitive information about the visitors of our website.
Our web hosting service provides us with a log where basic information about visits are recorded, such as visits per day, IP addresses, entry page, etc. But this information is anonymous and no names are provided or even recorded. Your IP address is linked to your internet service provider and not linked to you personally.
We do use a more elaborate counter for our website, powered by StatCounter that provides us with some extra analytics. We use those analytics to improve our website, and make it more user friendly for our visitors, but once again, none of the data collected is tied down to you personally, for no names or addresses are provided to us.
We do not actively send any cookies to you. If cookies are sent, it will be incidental from third-parties we may be using. For example, Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our sites. Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to our users based on their visit to our sites and other sites on the Internet. (Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy)
When contacting us by email, your information is kept strictly confidential, and neither your name nor your email address will be shared with anyone! We do not give away to others your email address, nor sell it or even share it with another person. We also will not use it to annoy you with things you didnâ€™t ask for. We will ONLY use your email address to respond to the email you sent us.
If you happen to purchase anything from our site, or make a donation, all your information will be kept private. We only accept paypal as a form of payment at this moment, and paypal keeps ALL your sensitive information hidden from us, including your financial data.
