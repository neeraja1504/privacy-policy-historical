Cross-Border Transfer
Your Personal Information may be stored and processed in any country where we have facilities or in which we engage service providers and you consent to the transfer of information to countries outside of your country of residence by using the Dexcom Products and Services or, if you are in a jurisdiction requiring affirmative consent, by providing your affirmative consent. The countries to which your Personal Information is transferred may have different data protection rules than those of your country.
For Personal Information that DexCom, Inc. receives from Affiliates and companies in the European Union, the European Economic Area, and Switzerland, DexCom, Inc. has committed to handling such personal information in accordance with the European law principles for international transfers such as EU Standard Contractual Clauses or Privacy Shield, further described below.
Privacy Shield
Dexcom may receive Personal Information of residents of the countries of the European Economic Area (" EEA "), which includes the 28 European Union Member States plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein from third parties or directly from those residents, including name, address, email and telephone number, ordering information and information regarding medical or health conditions that is considered sensitive information. We refer to such Personal Information as " European Personal Information." We recognize that the laws of the European Community restrict companies in the EEA from transferring European Personal Information to the United States unless there is "adequate protection" for such European Personal Information. To provide such adequate protection where we do not have in place other protections for European Personal Information meeting the requirements of applicable data privacy laws, as we are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, we will adhere to the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework (the " Privacy Shield ") published by the U.S. Department of Commerce ( ** www.privacyshield.gov ) with respect to European Personal Information that we receive. For example, we may agree in a specific circumstance to a model contract approved by the European Commission ( ** http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/transfer/index_en.htm ), and the terms of that model contract would apply in that circumstance.
Privacy Shield Principles
Dexcom complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries. Dexcom has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability. If there is any conflict between the policies in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/
Notice
We participate in the Privacy Shield as do our subsidiaries. The Privacy Shield List is available at the website maintained by the U.S. Department of Commerce: https://www.privacyshield.gov/list.
Dexcom manufactures, distributes and supports Dexcom Products that are continuous glucose monitors (" Dexcom CGMs "). Dexcom CGMs measure the User's glucose levels on a regular basis. We also distribute and support Software Apps that receive, store, process and transmit the User's glucose levels measured by Dexcom CGMs and other information to assist Users of Dexcom CGMs and their health care providers and others they designate to manage their glucose levels. We collect and use European Personal Information in connection with the use of such Software Apps, to communicate with Users about their use of Dexcom Products and Software Apps, to provide information about new Dexcom Products and Software Apps, and for conducting related task for legitimate business purposes. We will also disclose European Personal Information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
We may also collect and process human resources European Personal Information in reliance on the Privacy Shield.
Choice
In accordance with the requirements of the Privacy Shield, we will offer to persons whose European Personal Information is in our possession the opportunity to choose (opt out) whether the person's European Personal Information is to be disclosed to a third party or to be used for a purpose that is materially different from the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the person.
For sensitive information, we will obtain affirmative express consent (opt in) from persons if their European Personal Information is to be disclosed to a third party or used for a purpose other than those for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individuals through the exercise of opt-in choice. We will treat as sensitive any European Personal Information we receive from a third party where the third party identifies and treats it as sensitive.
Also, for jurisdictions requiring affirmative express consent in order to process or share your Personal Information, we will obtain your affirmative express consent to the extent required before processing or sharing your Personal Information.
Accountability for Onward Transfer
To transfer personal information to a third party acting as a controller, we will comply with the Notice and Choice Principles. We will also enter into a contract with the third-party controller that provides that such data may only be processed for limited and specified purposes consistent with the consent provided by the individual and that the recipient will provide at least the same level of protection as the Privacy Shield and will notify us if it makes a determination that it can no longer meet this obligation. The contract shall provide that when such a determination is made the third-party controller ceases processing or takes other reasonable and appropriate steps to remediate.
To transfer personal data to a third party acting as an agent, we will: (i) transfer such data only for limited and specified purposes; (ii) ascertain that the agent is obligated to provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the Privacy Shield; (iii) take reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure that the agent effectively processes the personal information transferred in a manner consistent with our obligations under the Privacy Shield; (iv) require the agent to notify us if it makes a determination that it can no longer meet its obligation to provide the same level of protection as is required by the Privacy Shield; (v) upon notice, including under (iv), take reasonable and appropriate steps to stop and remediate unauthorized processing; and (vi) provide a summary or a representative copy of the relevant privacy provisions of its contract with that agent to the U.S. Department of Commerce upon request.
With regard to the Principle of Accountability for Onward Transfer, we remain liable if our agent processes such personal information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
