Physical Location Information
Our Services and HTML-formatted emails include features that may require collecting different types of location information (such as IP Address, GPS coordinates or postal code) that we then use for the specific feature you have selected, such as:
** Where to Buy and Store Locator .  ** Some of our Services allow you to search for the nearest store that offers the Stanley Black & Decker product that you want and whether such nearby stores have certain of our items in stock.  If you access one of our Sites or Apps through a mobile device and you have enabled location-based services, location information may be collected for these features, by, for example, using satellite, cell phone tower or WiFi signals.  If you access these features through a desktop device, you can choose to have your browser provide us your location information based on your IP Address to respond to your request, or you may be asked to provide us with your location information. The specificity of the desktop device location information can vary depending on the browser you are using and how you are connected to the internet. Your mobile device settings may allow you to disable location-based services, which will prevent our Sites and Apps from accessing your precise mobile device location information.  We recommend you review the help or user manual provided with your device for instructions.
** Email.  Our emails use your IP Address to determine the postal code where you are located when you open the email.  This allows us to tailor content to you, such as a map of nearby stores carrying our products. The specificity of the location can vary depending on the device used to open our emails. Your email program may allow you to prevent the pixel tags or images in the emails you receive from us from downloading, which will also prevent our service provider from accessing your location information.  You can also unsubscribe from receiving our emails, as described in Section 6** below.

If you do not consent to provide location information or you disable location-based services on your mobile device, we may ask you to manually select the region where you are located, or to enter your zip or postal code.  Your desktop or mobile device settings may allow you to disable or block location-based services, which will prevent our Services from accessing your location information.   We recommend you review the help information or user manual provided with your device or browser for instructions.
