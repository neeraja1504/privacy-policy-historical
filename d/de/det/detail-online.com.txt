We use temporary session cookies and permanent cookies. Cookies are text files which are stored on your terminal and which enable an analysis of how the homepage, webshop and app are used. We use cookies and other data collection tools to collect data which helps us to personalise the services we offer.
For this we use the following tools:
11.1 Google Analytics
The homepage and webshop use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics enables analysis of how users are utilising the site. The information collected includes, e.g. information on the operating system, screen, your IP address, website views called up, the date and time of your visit to our website. The information created on your use of the website is generally transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. We have activated IP anonymisation. This means that your IP address will be shortened by Google before transmission within the Member States of the European Union or in other states which are signatories to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address by transmitted to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. Google uses this information on behalf of the website operator to analyse your use of the website, compile reports on activities within the app and to provide other services associated with use of the website to the provider of the app. The IP address transmitted within the context of Google Analytics is not associated with other information by Google.
You can prevent the transmission of data related to your use of the website (including your IP address) to Google and processing of this data by Google by deactivating Google Analytics in your browser.
Further information on conditions of use and data protection can be found at www.google.com/analytics/terms/ or policies.google.com. We wish to inform you that the configuration of Google Analytics on this website ensures the anonymised collection of IP addresses (known as IP masking).
11.2 Google AdWords
Our online shop uses the online advertising program “Google AdWords,” the online marketing system of Google Inc. (“Google”) and in this context conversion tracking (evaluation of visit actions). For this, Google AdWords creates a cookie on your computer if you land on our website via a Google advert.
These cookies lose their validity after 30 days and are not used for personal identification. Every Google AdWords customer receives a different cookie. This means that there is no possibility that cookies can be traced via the websites of AdWords customers. The information collected using the conversion cookie serves the purpose of creating conversion statistics. We are informed of the anonymous overall number of users who have clicked on our advert and been directed to a site fitted with a conversion tracking tag, but we do not receive any information which would enable the personal identification of users.
You can prevent collection of data on your use of adverts and the processing of this data through Google by deactivating Google Adwords in your browser.
Further information on data usage by Google, possible settings and objections and the privacy policy of Google AdWords can be found under policies.google.com/technologies/ads. Settings for how adverts are displayed by Google can be changed under adssettings.google.com.
10.3 SZMnG
Our website and webshop use the measuring procedure (“SZMnG”) of INFOnline GmbH to determine statistical characteristic values about use of the services we offer. The purpose of measuring the range is to determine statistically the intensity of use, the number of users of a website and the surfing behaviour – on the basis of a unified standard procedure – and thus to obtain comparable values across the market.For all digital providers who are members of IVW (Informationsgemeinschaft zur Feststellung der Verbreitung von Werbeträgern e.V.  - Information community to establish the scope of advertisers) or participate in studies by AGOF (Arbeitsgemeinschaft Online-Forschung e.V.  -Working Group for Online Research), the usage statistics are published regularly by AGOF, agma (Arbeitsgemeinschaft Media-Analyse e.V. - Working group for media analysis) and IVW and these can be viewed on the relevant websites. If you do not wish to participate in the measurements you can opt out using following the link: optout.ioam.de.&nbsp;
Further information on conditions of use and data protection can be found at https://www.infonline.de/datenschutz/benutzer/.
11.4 ADTECH
Our homepage and our online shop use advertising cookies of the provider ADTECH. For this the cookie under an anonymous user profile records the browser type, operating system and user behaviour (e.g. clicked advertising banners, subpages visited, anonymised surveys, etc.). This data is used for the purposes of showing you content and adverts in line with your interests and can be used for internal statistical analysis.
If you no longer wish to receive usage-based advertising inserts you can object under the following links and deactivate the collection of data: http://www.youronlinechoices.com/opt-out-interface
Thereafter ADTECH will no longer create advertising cookies on your browser.
12. Social Plugins
We use social plugins ("plugins") of social networks.
In order to increase the protection of your data when using our website, these plugins are not unrestricted, but instead are only incorporated into the site using HTML links (known as the "Shariff solution"). This ensures that using the site does not enable the creation of any connection to the servers of the provider of the relevant social network. When you click on one of the social media buttons a new window is opened and the page of the relevant service provider is called up on which you (possibly after entering your login data) can, for instance, press the Like or Share button.
Please see the data protection information of the providers for details as to the purpose and scope of data collection and the further processing and use of the data by the providers on their sites, as well as your rights in this respect and configuration options for the protection of your privacy.
