Facebook Pixel use
The Department of Education uses Facebook remarketing pixels to aid in customised, targeted follow-up advertising. The department may display interest-based ads to you when you are using Facebook through Facebook’s Custom Audience Tool. This tool allows us to personalise our ads based on your interests, demographics, location and any previous interactions with us.
Our website (education.nsw.gov.au) uses the Conversion Tracking Facebook Pixel to allow us to follow your actions once you have been redirected to our website via clicking on one of our Facebook ads. This assists us in recording the effectiveness of Facebook ads for reporting and market research purposes.
The data collected through the Facebook Pixel and provided to us is aggregated and remains anonymous, meaning that we cannot see the personal information of the individual user. However, the collected data is also saved and processed by Facebook and used in accordance with Facebook’s Data Use Policy.
The department may also share information about your use of our website and your interactions with our Facebook ads with our trusted social media, advertising and web analytics partners, including Google Analytics and SiteImprove (website usage not reported individually).
Facebook Conversion Tracking also allows Facebook and its partners to show you advertisements on and outside Facebook. A cookie will be saved onto your computer for these purposes.
Please visit Facebook Ad Preferences if you wish to revoke your permission.
Newsletter subscriptions
The department is requesting this information from you so that we can provide you with regular updates about Department of Education activities through an email newsletter.
For the same purpose, the department may provide this information about you to a service provider contracted to distribute the email newsletter.
The department will not disclose your personal information to anybody else unless we are required to do so by law - for example if the information is needed in an emergency or for a law enforcement purpose.
Providing us with the requested information is not required by law. However if you choose not to provide us with the requested information we cannot send you the email newsletter.
The email newsletter is offered as an ‘opt in’ subscription. You can 'opt out' at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the newsletter.
You may request access to your information at any time. Please visit https://education.nsw.gov.au/about-us/rights-and-accountability/privacy/privacy-legislation if you wish to access or update your personal information.
