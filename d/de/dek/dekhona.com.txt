Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites
dekhona.com allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the dekhona.com Sites. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the dekhona.com Sites. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content you see.
dekhona.com does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. However, please note that if an advertiser asks dekhona.com to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, women ages 21-29 who have viewed certain channels of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. The advertiser may also use information regarding your use of the dekhona.com Sites, such as the number of times you viewed an ad (but not any personally identifiable information), to determine which ads to deliver to you.
You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks for more information on their practices and for instructions on how to opt-out of certain practices. dekhona.com's privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites.
Our Commitment To Data Security
dekhona.com uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to dekhona.com and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, dekhona.com makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.
