Information Collection and Use
Saavn requires users to register for the service and provide personal information, including but not limited to, the user's name, zip code, and email address. Saavn uses this information to establish and deliver service to the individual. Saavn may use this information to contact registered users to notify them of product and service updates, provide instruction, and to deliver other service related information. Saavn may also contact users to request additional information and feedback. Saavn may employ companies and people to perform tasks on its behalf, and will need to share personal information with these agents to establish and deliver service to the individual. Saavn's agents do not receive any right to use personal information beyond what is necessary to perform these tasks.
If you connect to Saavn using Facebook, the default setting is generally that Saavn automatically shares your activity and activity-related stories with that service, including the music you listen to. You understand that such information may be attributed to your account on Facebook or the Other Integrated Service and may be published on such service. Saavn may store your username and an access token or similar credentials obtained from the third party service, so that you are able to share particular items of content, on that third party service, on an individual basis, without entering your access credentials again.
You understand and agree that Facebook’s or other third parties’ use of information they collect from you is governed by their privacy policies, and Saavn’s use of such information is governed by this Privacy Policy.
We may from time to time share your information with other companies in the Saavn group as well as certain trusted business partners and third party service providers to enable them to perform functions and process user data on our behalf. Such third parties' processing of user data will always be subject to security and confidentiality obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.
In addition to the above, we may also share your information to third parties for these limited purposes:
to allow a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets;
to respond to legal process (e.g. a court order or subpoena), if we believe in good faith that it is necessary to do so; to comply with requirements of mandatory applicable law; to protect the safety of any person; to protect the rights and property of Saavn, including to enforce the Terms and Conditions of Use; and to address fraud, security or technical issues;
to allow other companies affiliated with Saavn to use your information as specified in this Privacy Policy;
to inform business partners about use of the Service and products and services made available through the Service, in the form of aggregated statistics or otherwise in a format which does not reveal your identity; and
if you expressly opt in to such sharing.
You understand and agree that the privacy policies of third parties will govern all use of information that we provide to them under this section.
