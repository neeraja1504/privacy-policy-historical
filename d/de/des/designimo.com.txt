Privacy Policy
OVERVIEW
This privacy policy describes how Designimo.com maintains, uses and shares information that we may collect when you use our website.
We may change this privacy policy from time to time. Any such changes will be posted here. If we make a material change in the way we use your personal information, we will prominently note the change on the Sites and/or email you regarding the change at least thirty (30) days prior to the change taking effect.
We do not collect, use, or disclose any information about users of our Sites except as described in this Privacy Policy.
HOW WE COLLECT AND USE INFORMATION
Some of the information we collect when you use any of the Sites, such as your name, company name, postal address, email address, credit card information or telephone numbers, may allow you to be identified ("Personal Information").
Registration: If you would like to create, edit or purchase rights to use a logo or other design ("Design"), order any merchandise displaying a Design ("Merchandise") or use any other products or services that we may offer from time to time, you will be asked to provide Personal Information, which we will use to fulfill your request.
Marketing Partnerships: We may make your Personal Information available to other organizations to market products or services that may be of interest to you. Such marketing may be via email, telephone, direct mail or other means. By providing your Personal Information on any of the Sites, you are expressly consenting to receive such marketing communications from us and others.
Inquiries. If you send us a comment or question or make an inquiry to customer support, we will retain the information that you provide to us for the purpose of responding to you, as well as for improving the Sites and our customers' use of our services.
Visitors: If you are just visiting our website and not creating or editing a Design, ordering Merchandise, registering, requesting information, contacting us, or posting to a public area of any of the Sites, we do not ordinarily collect any Personal Information about you.
Pre-Populating Forms: When you enter certain contact information on websites of our marketing partners and then link to one of the Sites, your URL parameters may capture and transmit to us personal information that you provided on the partner website, such as your name, address, phone number or email address. We then use that information, for your convenience, to pre-populate Designs or forms on the Sites. If you decide not to permit cookies on your computer, this may affect your ability to use the Sites.
Communicating with You. We may use information that we collect from you for the purpose of communicating with you and responding to your inquiries. Those communications could, for example, take the form of service updates, promotions for products or services that we or one of our marketing partners provide, or e-newsletters.
Service Providers: We may at times contract with third party service providers to perform functions for us. These service providers may be given access to the information we collect for the purpose of performing those functions, but they will be contractually bound to maintain the confidentiality of the information and not to use it for any other purpose.
Business Transfers: If we were to transfer all or substantially all of our assets to another company, one of the assets we would likely include in the transfer is our database of Personal Information.
Disclosures for Legal Reasons: We will disclose Personal Information when we are required to do so by law, regulation or securities exchange requirement, for example, in response to a court order or subpoena. We also may disclose such information in response to a law enforcement or other governmental agency's request or when we believe such disclosure is appropriate to protect our legal rights or to safeguard anyone's property or safety.
