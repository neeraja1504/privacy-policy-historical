This information will not be given to or shared with anyone outside of Desiring God or our service providers unless you expressly allow it, or we believe that it is necessary to comply with the law, protect a person’s safety, or address fraud or security issues.
Online Contributions
When you make a donation on our website, the personal information you provide to us is used to process your donation and add you to our donor email list. This information is protected using SSL encryption. Your payment information is securely transmitted to our payment processor in order to process the contribution and it is not stored on our end. We maintain your name, email address, and donation amount in order to comply with accounting requirements, manage receipting and provide your donation history.

Mailing Lists
When you sign up for one of our mailing lists, we collect your name and email address. We use this information to send you what you’ve requested from us (e.g., the latest “Ask Pastor John” article). We do not sell, license, or share our mailing lists (email or physical), or your name and email address, with anyone outside of our organization. If you want to change, update or remove your name and email address on our list, you can do that by logging in to your account or contacting us at email@desiringGod.org.
