Cookies
Our Site uses cookies to make sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly. These are ASP (Active Server Pages) session cookies and do not track you in any way beyond DesignerToday domain and our server. We also use Webtrends cookies to determine which areas of the magazine are the most popular, and to find out what sites are referring readers to the magazine. We use this information for no other purpose. These cookies do not collect any personal information.
Advertisers
We maintain our own ad serving technology and advertisers have only limited access to these resources (page view and clicks). We do not collect any personal information for advertisers.
Personal Information
This Web site does not request any personal information or collect any information that personally identifies you or allows you to be personally contacted.
We do however collect personal information from our monthly drawings and the drawing sponsor(s) do receive the information for their own purposes (if they have requested the information) after the drawing concludes. The only way the sponsor receives your information is if you fill out a monthly drawing form. If you do not participate in a drawing then there is no collection of personal data. This is the only portion of the website that collects any personal data, and it is only through you entering data in the monthly drawing form. By entering personal data in the monthly drawing form you are giving the DesignerToday permission to forward that personal information to the contest sponsors. The data is not used in any other way or given to any entity other than the drawing sponsor for that particular month.
We also maintain a weekly newsletter. The only information we store is your e-mail address. It is not given out, traded or sold to any 3rd party. We only maintain the e-mail address list so that we can send the newsletter each week. Rest assured no one else has access to this data.
