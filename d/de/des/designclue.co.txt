Privacy Policy
We take your privacy seriously.
What information we collect
To create an account we require your email address, username, business or real name, location, and password.
Users may also enter additional information to their profile such as bio and website.
We collect overall information on our users through Google Analytics such as browser type, time on site, and ip address.
What we do with it
We will use your email address to update you on site events such as new contests, or receiving a private message from another user. We will never share your email with any third parties. Passwords are MD5 encrypted and not even designclue Staff can view them.
We will never share your business or real name; we use this to generate a basic contract to transfer the ownership rights of the logo from designer to contest holder when the contest prize is paid.
Your location, profile information, and contest information is viewable publicly on the site.
We use information generated form Google Analytics to learn more about site visitors, and to improve the site based on these findings.
