Privacy | DESTACO
Information Collection and Use - DESTACO is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. DESTACO collects information from our users at several different points on our website. Before we collect any information we will invite our customers to opt-in to give us permission to collect data.
Opt-in versus Opt-out - The opt-in approach allows consumers to control the information gathering process, and is generally considered the most user-oriented approach. When a consumer no longer wants to receive email from DESTACO, they will have the option to opt-out. Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional materials may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to unsubscribe in the subject line or in the email.
Order - We request information from the user on our catalog order form. Here a user must provide contact information (like name and shipping address). This information is used to fill customer's orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user.
Links - This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that DESTACO is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information.
Newsletters and Literature - If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter or request literature, we ask for contact information such as name and email address.
Surveys & Contests - From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information.
Security - This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line.
