You may also choose to create an account or login using your Google or Facebook credentials, so we will receive your name and email address as permitted by your profile settings in order to authenticate you. You can also authorize us to synchronized a contact list, so that you can easily connect with those contacts within our platforms. The information we receive when you link or integrate our Services with a third-party service depends on the settings and privacy policy controlled by that third-party service.

The right to be forgotten
We have made very easy for you to delete your information. All our products feature a “delete me” button under your account settings. If you have a personal account, you can simply click delete account, and all your information will be deleted within 72 hours. If your account is linked to an organisation, we may have to request their permission first, see “Notice to the end user”.
Children’s information:  The Services are not directed to individuals under 16. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 16. If we become aware that a child under 16 has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to delete such information. If you become aware that a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us.
Policies Changes:  We may change this policy from time to time, and when we do, we will revise the updated date at the top of this page. We encourage Users to frequently check this page for any changes to stay informed about how we are helping to protect the personal information we collect. If you continue to use our Services after those changes are in effect, you agree to the revised policy. If the changes are significant, we may provide more prominent notice or obtain your consent as required by law.
Links:  Please note that content created and displayed through our Services may contain links to third party websites. We hereby disclaim any liability in relation to the privacy practices of other websites.
Many of our products are intended for use by organizations. Where the Services are made available to you through an organisation account (e.g. your employer, supplier or client), that organisation is the administrator of the Services and is responsible for the accounts and/or Service sites over which it has control.
If this is the case, please direct your data privacy questions to your administrator, as your use of the Services is subject to that organization’s policies. We are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of an administrator’s organization, which may be different than this policy.
Administrators are able to:
View and disclose content you created or uploaded on the account.
Modify and take ownership of content you created/uploaded on the account.
Require you to reset your account password;
Restrict, suspend or terminate your access to the Services;
Access information in and about your account;
Access or retain information stored as part of your account;
Install or uninstall third-party apps or other integrations
In some cases, administrators can also:
Restrict, suspend or terminate your account access;
Change the email address associated with your account;
Change your information, including profile information;
Restrict your ability to edit, restrict, modify or delete information
Even if the Services are not currently administered to you by an organisation, if you use an email address provided by an organization (such as your work email address) to access the Services, then the owner of the domain associated with your email address (e.g. your employer) may assert administrative control over your account and use of the Services at a later date. You will be notified if this happens.
If you do not want an administrator to be able to assert control over your account or use of the Services, use your personal email address to register for or access the Services. If an administrator has not already asserted control over your account or access to the Services, you can update the email address associated with your account through your account settings in your profile. Once an administrator asserts control over your account or use of the Services, you will no longer be able to change the email address associated with your account without administrator approval.
Please contact your organization or refer to your administrator’s organizational policies for more information.
