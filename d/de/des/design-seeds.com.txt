Privacy Policy | Design Seeds
The Design Seeds site is powered 100% through the support of Sponsors and Patrons.
We are a site of reciprocity, meaning operating costs are supported through tips and patronage. This is in lieu of running ads that track behavior & collect data, creating a value proposition of privacy. The Design Seeds site is also free of Analytics, and your data is not collected to be sold.
We collect information from you when you subscribe to the daily email or pay a gratuity via the Design Seeds Tip Jar. The information is gathered to better service you in responding to your requests, offer appropriate customer service, and quickly process your transactions. We collect your email address in order to send information, respond to inquiries, or send additional information if needed in relation to your service.
Your personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. We implement a variety of security measures when a user enters, submits, or accesses their information to maintain the safety of your personal information.
All efforts are made to minimize the use of cookies, while maximizing site functionality for visitors. Design Seeds does not use cookies for advertising (including running ads, or collecting data for ad networks and marketing).
You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser settings. Since each browser is a little different, look at your browser’s Help Menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. If you turn cookies off, some features will be disabled that make your site experience more efficient, and may not function properly. However, you will still be able to place orders.
Through Design Seeds, Seed has established strategic partnerships. Paid collaborations fund the seasonal inspiration feature on the site. Design Seeds palettes, inspiration images, story concepts, and insights are not part of these partnerships. Utilizing a specific color specifier system, linking to the sponsor’s site, and providing approved copy pertaining to the sponsor are part of the paid agreement. Unique collateral (including sponsor branded color palettes without an inspiration image) is also created by Seed for the sponsor’s use. Mentions, retweets, pins, posts, and shares on social media of seasonal vignettes are not paid for. They are shared by Seed considering relevance and interest to readers and followers.
Seed consults to clients by creating visual content and social media strategy. Mentions, retweets, pins, posts, and shares of client work are not paid for and are shared at Seeds’ discretion regarding relevance and interest to readers and followers.
