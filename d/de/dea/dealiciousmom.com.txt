About Dealicious Mom
Hi, my name is Sara. I am the Founder of “Deal”icious Mom. I’m a wife, mom to two amazing boys and a brand new baby!! I also work as a special education teacher and am not sure I have room for anything else but I sure can try! So as you can see my days are pretty full… but not full enough for me not to be addicted to deal hunting as well! I am on the constant search to get things for free or close to free. I founded Dealicious Mom in 2008 to share my deals and steals with you. So if you enjoy our blog or you would like to help in our quest, please leave a comment, sign up for our feed or email subscription and share in the fun!
Our community of moms has grown over the years and become a destination that helps us all live the sweet life AND spend less. Please don’t hesitate to reach out to me and our panel of moms. We look forward to connecting with you!
