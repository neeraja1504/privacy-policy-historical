Who Do We Share Your Data With?
Here at dealchecker, we work with a number of partners to improve the experience that we can provide you (our users) with. These partners act as data processors, enabling us to run our website smoothly.
Adobe
We use Adobe's analytics suite so that we can understand how our website is performing. We share our site usage data with them and they let us organise it into a manner that can be understood and used to make improvements. You can find out more about their GDPR plans here.
Google Analytics
Google Analytics also provides site usage data. In addition to this, it helps us to understand the demographic of our users so that we can provide content and deals that are relevant to them. Google uses a variety of methods to gather this data, for example when you sign up with a Google account, or also by some educated guesses based on your browsing history. They also enable us to recognise trends in page's popularity which stops us from becoming out of date.
