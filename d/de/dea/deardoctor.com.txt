Cookies & IP Information
"Cookies" are pieces of information that are placed by a Web site in a storage place on your computer. Cookies do not contain information that is, in itself, personally identifying. Cookies may be placed on your computer in a limited way to help deliver advertisements, to calculate unique site visitors, and to track usage throughout our site.
