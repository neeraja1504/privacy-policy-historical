Uses of Personal Information
We may use Personal Information and other information received and collected from you to provide the Services you have requested, including for the purpose of sending you updates or to contact you upon your request and when otherwise necessary. We may also use Personal Information for auditing, research and analysis, and to operate and improve our Services. In certain circumstances, we may share aggregated non-personal information with third parties. In certain limited instances, Personal Information that you provide towards creation of a publicly visible profile on our Website may be indexed by search engines (such as www.google.com and www.bing.com) and may appear in search results on such search engines.
In the course of using Personnel Information as aforesaid, we may rely on third party service providers and may disclose such Personal Information to such third party service providers. In such cases, we require that they comply with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. We may also share such information with third parties in limited circumstances, including when complying with legal process, preventing fraud or imminent harm, and ensuring the security of our network and Services. You hereby consent to the disclosure and use of Personal Information in furtherance of the afore-stated purposes.
Unless otherwise agreed, where we propose to use your Personal Information for any other uses we will ensure that we notify you first. You will also be given the opportunity to withhold or withdraw your consent for your use other than as listed above.
Confidentiality and Security
We will keep confidential and protect your Personal Information except where disclosure is required or permitted by law.
We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and, once we receive it, for storage and disposal. When you enter sensitive information on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). All information we gather is securely stored within databases controlled by us. The databases are stored on servers secured behind a firewall; access to the servers is password-protected and is strictly limited. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
We limit access to Personal Information to employees, agents, advisors and consultants who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or Services to you or in order to do their jobs.
We may provide information, including Personal Information, to third-party service providers to help us deliver our products, information, and Services efficiently and effectively.

We will take reasonable steps to ensure that these third-party service providers are obligated to protect Personal Information on our behalf through confidentiality agreements and otherwise. We do not intend to transfer Personal Information without your consent to third parties who are not bound to act on our behalf unless such transfer is legally required. Similarly, it is against our policy to sell Personal Information collected online without consent.
If you choose to provide us with your Personal Information, we may transfer that Personal Information from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. Your Personal Information may be collected and stored on servers located in the territory of Singapore and any other countries as per our data management policy and practices and our service provider engagements. You hereby consent to the transfer of your Personal Information as aforesaid, and we assure you any such transfer of your Personal Information shall not diminish or adversely affect your rights in relation to such Personal Information as under this Policy.

If you click on a link to a third-party site or otherwise leave the Website, you will go to a website that is outside the purview of our control.
