4. HOW IS YOUR PERSONAL DATA COLLECTED?
4.1 Online
(a) Visitors to our websites
When you visit our websites, we use third party service providers (including Google Analytics and Adjusts) to collect standard internet log information and details of visitor behavior patterns. We do this to find out things such as the number of visitors to the various parts of the websites. This information is only processed in a way which does not identify anyone. We do not make any attempt to find out the identities of those visiting our websites.
You may decide to submit personal information to us through the website, for example, when purchasing goods or services, signing up to a newsletter, filling in a survey, or entering a competition. When we collect personal data in this way this policy sets out what we intend to do with it.
Visitors and Users from outside of the United States should note that we collect, process and store information in the United States we collect from our Sites and Forums. By using our Sites and Forums from locations outside of the United States, you consent to the transfer of your personal information to, and the collection and processing of such personal information in the United States. The laws pertaining to the collection, use, disclosure, and processing of personal information in the United States may vary from those in other countries and may be less or more stringent than the applicable laws in your state or country. Accordingly, those who choose to access and provide personal information to our Sites and Forums from outside of the United States do so based on their own initiative and are solely responsible for compliance with applicable local laws.
(b) Cookies
Our website uses cookies. A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that we put on your computer if you agree. These cookies allow us to distinguish you from other users of our website, which helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our website and also allows us to improve our site. Read more about the individual cookies we use and how to recognize them by clicking here.
(c) Search Engine
Search queries and results of searches on our website are logged anonymously to help us improve our website and search functionality. We do not collect any user-specific data.
(d) Security and performance
To maintain the security and performance of our websites we use a third party service which processes the IP address of visitors and other Technical Data.
This information is retained for a maximum period of 24 months.
(e) Social Media
We use various social media channels, including Wechat, Weibo, Facebook and Twitter and will process your personal information when you interact with us (for example by liking or sharing a post). We use this information to improve our services.
(f) Online accounts
When you set up an online account with us, we will request personal data from you in order to verify your identity and set up your account. This information will also be used when you interact with us through the websites.
We will keep this information for a period of at least 5 years from the date of your last log in to the service, unless you have purchased goods and/or services through our websites or opted in to marketing communications in which case such accounts will be kept active for so long as we keep such information in line with the rest of this policy.
(g) Internet Based Advertising
Dealmoon engages third-party advertising companies to serve advertisements when you visit our websites and to serve advertisements on our behalf on non-affiliated websites. These advertising companies may use cookies, web beacons, pixels, embedded scripts, and other technologies to automatically collect information about your use of our websites, such as your IP address, web browser, pages viewed, time spent on pages, links clicked, and conversion information. This information may be used by us and others to analyze and track data, deliver adverting content targeted to your interests on our website and other websites, determine the popularity of certain content, and understand your online activity. This means that some information about your browsing of our websites and other third-party sites may be shared with these advertising companies for the purpose of delivering ads to you on our websites and certain third-party sites, and Dealmoon may receive from some of these companies' information about third-party sites that you have visited. This information is used for marketing purposes, a practice sometimes referred to as "retargeting" to indicate that information from one website is used to suggest relevant products offered by another website.
These and other third parties may also collect data about your online activities over time and across different websites when you use Dealmoon's websites.
Dealmoon may also work with third parties to serve advertisements to you as part of a customized campaign on other websites or platforms.
Note that your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a "Do Not Track" signal to websites and online services you visit. There is no consensus among industry participants as to what "Do Not Track" means in this context. Like many other websites and online services, Dealmoon currently does not alter its practices when it receives a "Do Not Track" signal from a visitor's browser. To find out more information about "Do Not Track," you may visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com.
Please note that electing to opt-out will not stop advertisements from appearing in your web browser or applications. If you use a different browser, erase cookies from your browser, or use a different mobile device, you may need to renew your opt-out choices. Also, any cookie blocking setting that you implement may not block the use of non-cookie technologies by third parties.
In addition, certain advertising networks and exchanges may participate in the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI"). The NAI has developed a tool that allows consumers to opt out of targeting advertising delivered by NAI members' ad networks. To learn more about opting-out or using the tool, visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/. Dealmoon is not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties' opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs. Your choices are both browser- and device-specific.

8. DISCLOSURES OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA
We may have to share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out above. These parties may be:
• Other members and affiliates of the Dealmoon Group who provide us with services to enable us to operate our business. We may also share personal data so that we can improve the Dealmoon Group's products and services as a whole.
• Third party service providers (acting as processors) who provide IT and system administration services and support.

9. WHERE IS YOUR INFORMATION STORED OR TRANSFERRED
The information we collect from you may be transferred to, stored at, and processed in destinations inside or outside of the country in which you are located and may be accessible to the governments of such destinations under local law. This includes use by us. Other members of the Dealmoon Group and many of our external third party suppliers are based outside the United States and/or the European Economic Area (EEA) so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the United States and/or the EEA.
Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the United States or the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
• We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission.
• Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe.
• Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the EEA and the US.
Please contact us (our contact details are set out above) if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the United States or EEA.
10. DATA SECURITY
We have put in place appropriate security measures to help prevent your personal data from being lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered, destroyed, or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
Although Dealmoon uses reasonable efforts to help protect your information, transmission via the Internet is not completely secure and Dealmoon cannot guarantee the security of your information collected through our service. Further, you are responsible for protecting your password.
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
11. CHOICES REGARDING YOUR INFORMATION
You have certain choices about how we use your personal information. They are summarized below:
11.1 Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request").
You may receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you.
11.2 Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you.
This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
11.3 Request erasure of your personal data.
This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
11.4 Object to processing of your personal data
Where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms you may object to our processing of your personal data. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which overrides your rights and freedoms.
11.5 Request restriction of processing of your personal data.
This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
11.6 Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party.
We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
11.7 Withdraw consent at any time
Where we are relying on consent to process your personal data you may withdraw this consent at any time. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
11.8 How to exercise your rights
If you wish to exercise any of the rights set forth in paragraph 14, please send a written request or contact us here.
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
11.9 Your right to complain to the relevant supervisory authority.
You have the right to make a complaint at any time to your relevant supervisory authority for data protection issues. We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the supervisory authority so please contact us (our contact details are set out above) in the first instance.
12. UPDATING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
It is important that the personal data we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your personal data changes during your relationship with us.
You may contact us to review, update, or modify personal information that you have provided to us or request that we deactivate your account. We may retain certain personal information in our archives for record-keeping purposes. We do not have the ability to remove information from the databases of third parties with which we have already shared your information.
13. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY
This Privacy Policy is current as of the effective date set forth above. Dealmoon reserves the right to change this privacy policy from time to time consistent with applicable privacy laws and principles. If we make changes to this Privacy Policy we will notify you by revising the date at the top of this Privacy Policy, and in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to the homepages of our websites or sending you an e-mail notification).
