At Dealivore, you can get deals at a discounted price. These deals are generally offered as time limited vouchers that can be redeemed at merchants or restaurants. This Dealivore privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") is intended to inform you of our policies and practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of any information you submit to us through Dealivore. This includes "Personal Information," which is information about you that is personally identifiable such as your name, e-mail address, mobile number, user ID number, and other non-public information that is associated with the foregoing, as well as "Anonymous Information," which is information that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Information and does not permit the identification of individual persons.
User Consent
By accessing or otherwise using Dealivore, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and the associated Terms of Service you expressly consent to the processing of your Personal Information and Anonymous Information according to this Privacy Policy. Your Personal Information may be processed by us in the country where it was collected as well as other countries where laws regarding processing of Personal Information may be less stringent than the laws in your country.
Regarding Children
Children under the age of 13 are not permitted to use Dealivore and we do not intentionally collect or maintain Personal Information from those who are under 13 years old.

We recommend that children between the ages of 13 and 18 obtain their parent's permission before submitting information over the internet. By using Dealivore, you are representing that you are at least 18 years old, or that you are at least 13 years old and have your parents' permission to use Dealivore.

Information Collected Via Technology
As you use Dealivore, certain information may also be passively collected and stored on our or our service providersâ€™ server logs, including your Internet protocol address, browser type, and operating system. We also use Cookies and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the solutions and information for which you searched and viewed, or on which of the advertisements displayed on Dealivore you clicked. This type of information is collected to make Dealivore and solutions more useful to you and to tailor the experience with Dealivore to meet your special interests and needs. An "Internet protocol address" or "IP Address" is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. In some cases your IP Address stays the same from browser session to browser session; but if you use a consumer internet access provider, your IP Address probably varies from session to session. "Cookies" are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computerâ€™s hard drive while you are viewing a website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience with Dealivore. Persistent Cookies can be removed by following your Internet browser help file directions. In order to use our services offered through Dealivore, your web browser must accept Cookies. If you choose to disable Cookies, some aspects of Dealivore may not work properly, and you will not be able to receive our services. We may also enable advertisers and ad servers to promote third-party products and/or services by placing advertisements on Dealivore. These advertisers and ad servers may use Cookies and/or "Web Beacons" (which are usually small, transparent graphic images) in order to monitor information related to served advertisements. Clicking on such advertisements will direct you to the website of a third-party and the advertiser. This Privacy Policy does not cover the privacy practices of any advertisers or ad servers.

Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not generally sell, trade, rent, or share the Personal Information that we collect with third parties, unless you ask or authorize us to do so.

In general, Personal Information you submit to us is used by us to provide you access to Dealivore, to improve Dealivore, to better tailor the features, performance, and support of Dealivore and to offer you additional information, opportunities, promotions and functionality from us, our partners or our advertisers at your request. Additionally, we do share your content preferences and other information with the social network from which you have connected to Dealivore, along with those companies and persons you have asked us to share your information with.

You acknowledge that such transfers may occur and are permitted by this Privacy Policy, and that any acquirer of ours or that acquirerâ€™s assets may continue to process your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
