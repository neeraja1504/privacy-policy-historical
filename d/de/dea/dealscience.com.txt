Cookies and other similar web technologies
We use several common web tracking tools to help identify you and collect usage information as you use our Service over time and across different platforms. We also work with third parties that collect and use information this way. The tools we use include “cookies” (a small piece of data that a web server places in a file on your computer) and “web beacons” (single pixel GIF images that are placed in the code of a web page or in an email newsletter). If you are concerned about our use of these technologies, most web browsers provide users the ability to limit the use of cookies and web beacons by adjusting their privacy settings.
