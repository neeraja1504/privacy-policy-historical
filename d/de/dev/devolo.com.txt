Data privacy at devolo - devolo AG
devolo AG takes protection of your personal data very seriously. We would like you to know when and what data we collect and how we use it. We have introduced technical and organisational measures that ensure compliance with the regulations on data protection by us as well as by external service providers.
In the course of updates of our web pages and the implementation of new technologies to improve our service for you, changes to this data protection declaration can be necessary. We therefore recommend you read this data protection declaration again from time to time.
What are personal data?
Personal data is information that could be used to identify personal or factual information about you. Information that could not be used to identify you (or only with a disproportionate level of effort) is not classed as personal data (e.g. data that has been pseudonymised or anonymised).
Does devolo AG use cookies?
devolo AG uses three different types of "cookies" (small files containing configuration information). The first type is used to maintain your session if you change pages, the second to protect the integrity of your session and the third to recognise you in the case of revisits. The first two types are not stored and expire after a maximum time of 120 minutes for registered users or a maximum time of 20 minutes for unregistered visitors or if you close your browser. The third type is valid for a period of 2 years and is renewed upon each visit. In some cases selected partners use anonymised cookies although these cannot be used for identification of the individual user. You can also use our services without cookies. Most browsers are pre-configured to allow cookies automatically. However, you can deactivate the acceptance of cookies or set the browser to alert you before cookies are stored. We would like to point out that you will not be able to use all our website features if you decline feature-related cookies.

For what purpose does devolo AG use your data?
We use and store your personal data solely to provide the selected e-services. Retrievals of information are evaluated on a pseudonymised basis in order to manage and optimise product and advertising offers on our website. Statistical evaluation of pseudonymised or anonymised datasets is retained and is stored, for example, for system security reasons (to prevent misuse), for improvement of the website and for statistical purposes.

Security precautions for protection of the data we store
Any data which we collect is stored on servers in Germany which are especially protected. Only a few persons who are responsible for the technical, commercial or editorial administration are authorised to access these servers. To avoid any loss or misuse of data stored at devolo AG, we take extensive technical and internal security precautions which are reviewed on a regular basis and updated in line with technical progress. However, we wish to point out that the rules of data protection and the above mentioned security measures may be violated by persons or institutions beyond the scope of our responsibility due to the structure of the internet. In particular data which is sent unencrypted - including by e-mail - can be read by third parties. We do not have any technical influence on such actions. The user is responsible for protecting any data provided against misuse by means of encryption or any other method. Our online service contains links to other websites. We have no influence on whether these providers comply with the data protection regulations.
Your right to information, rectification, blocking and deletion
In compliance with the Bundesdatenschutzgesetz (BDSG, Federal Data Protection Act) you have the right to information as well as the right to rectification, blocking and deletion of your personal data.

As an AdWords customer, this website also uses Google Conversion Tracking, an analysis service of Google Inc. (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA; "Google“). In this case Google Adwords sets a cookie in your computer ("conversion cookie“) if you access our website via a Google advertisement. These cookies cease to be valid alter 30 days and are not used for the purpose of personal identification. If you visit certain web pages of our company and the cookie has not yet expired, both we and Google can see that someone has clicked on the advertisement and was therefore directed to our website. Every AdWords customer receives a different cookie. Cookies cannot be traced via the websites of AdWords customers. The information obtained with the aid of the conversion cookie is used to produce conversion statistics for AdWords customers who have opted for conversion tracking. AdWords customers find out about the total number of users who have clicked on their advertisement and were directed to a website marked with a conversion tracking tag. However, these AdWords customers do not receive any information through which they can personally identify users. If you do not want to take part in the tracking process, you can also refuse to accept the necessary setting of a cookie - for example by means of a browser setting which normally deactivates automatic setting of cookies.

devolo AG expressly warns that inherent security gaps may exist with regard to the transmission of data over the Internet (e.g. by e-mail) and that data cannot be protected with 100% security against unauthorised access.
The use of the service provider's identifying contact data—in particular the telephone/fax numbers and e-mail addresses — for commercial advertising is expressly undesired without prior written authorisation from devolo AG or unless a business relationship is already in existence. devolo AG reserves the right to take legal measures in the case of infringement.
