Why Demand Metric Collects Information
Demand Metric uses the information we collect for the following purposes:
Provide Our Services - We use your information to deliver our Services, like sending you or presenting you with, relevant content. Another example is that we use unique identifiers stored in cookies on your device to help us authenticate you as the person who should have access to your Demand Metric account.
Maintain & Improve Our Services - We also use your information to ensure our Services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. If we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
And we use your information to make improvements to our Services – for example, to understand and analyze the usage trends and preferences of our Demand Metric account members and to improve the way the Services work and look.
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our Services, which can help us build better products. It may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
Develop New Services - We use the information we collect in existing Services to help us create new features and functionality.
Provide Personalized Services - We use the information we collect to customize our Services for you, including remembering your information so that you will not have to log-in again the next time you visit the Services if you haven’t signed out. In addition, we may use the information we collect to provide personalized and relevant content, for example showing you tools and resources based on your selected “Top Priority”.
Measure Performance - We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our Services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design, monitor and analyze the operation and effectiveness of the Services and related activities, and monitor aggregate site usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages viewed. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by Demand Metric. You can opt-out from Google Analytics by clicking here.
Communicate with You - We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification of new resources published, or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our Services. We will also use your email address to contact you with respect to survey and webinar invitations; for administrative and customer service purposes; to address intellectual property infringement, rights of privacy, or defamation issues; or regarding things you post on the Services. Should you contact Demand Metric, we may keep a record of your request to help solve any issues you might be facing.

These messages may be targeted at you based on your activities on our Services, for example your interaction with a particular resource or your entry into a specific survey.

When you register for webinars, participate in surveys or download resources that are sponsored by third parties, your personal information will be provided to that particular third party along with your web activity regarding their partnered content.
Protect Demand Metric, Our Users, and the Public - We use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our Services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Demand Metric, our users, or the public. For example, we collect and analyze IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse can take many forms, such as sending spam to Demand Metric users or launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. When we detect spam, malware, illegal content, and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action.
