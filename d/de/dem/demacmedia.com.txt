Connecting To Google Applications
Bounteous hosts several tools and calculators on www.bounteous.com that provide the ability for visitors to connect to certain Google products, like Google Analytics. Different Bounteous tools may ask for different permissions, so it is important to review the requested permissions before allowing access.
How It Works
In order for these Bounteous applications to work properly, a user must begin the process by clicking the ‘Connect’ button. The user will be taken to a secure page on Google.com via a new window or tab, where the permissions the tool requires will be displayed. If the user consents to grant Bounteous' permission, Google will issue a token that our tools can use to access the requested information.
For these tools and calculators, Bounteous only requests temporary access to a user’s Google application. After receiving permission, Bounteous can, within the scope of the approved access, request information about, or data from, any account the user has access to. By default, our access to a user’s information expires after one hour.
By default, our tools are able to see the email address of the of the user's account, if the user opts to use our tools and provides authentication. We do not capture or store this information on our servers. Our tools do not ever see or store a user’s password, as that is entered on a secure window or tab on Google’s website and is not visible to us.
As no information is stored by default, no Bounteous employee or other individual has access to user email addresses or the results of the tools, including the data received from Google, unless the user explicitly opts-in to sharing results via email or signing up for email newsletters.
We do not request the ability to extend the lifetime of the token (termed ‘Offline Access’). We do not store or receive the token on our server anywhere; the token itself is only accessible by the user’s browser.
To monitor which tools from Bounteous, and others, have been granted access to your information, and to see which permissions have been granted, review your connected applications here: https://myaccount.google.com/permissions.
How Do We Use The Information?
The information that we request is used by our tools in calculations and visualizations about your selected data. Again, we do not store your information by default; however, depending on the tool, we may ask if you would like to share or email the results of your information. If offered, this step is voluntary but may allow us to receive a copy of your information so that we may provide recommendations, analysis, or follow-up support regarding your use of the tool or your individual results. If you share your results with others via email, or specifically ask for Bounteous to follow-up, we may follow up infrequently to offer support, answer questions, or offer services.
Customer Email Lists
Bounteous maintains several email newsletters to help communicate information about our recent blog posts, upcoming trainings, and other general informational and marketing purposes. You can opt-out of these electronic communications at any time by following the instructions in our emails.
When you register for blog updates, we will send you content related to your choices. At any time, you may update your subscription settings to change the frequency or types of emails, or opt-out completely of these electronic communications by following the instructions in our emails or by emailing bnt-privacy@bounteous.com.
