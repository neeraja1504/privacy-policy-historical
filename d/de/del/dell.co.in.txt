You also may ask to see the personal data you have given us and request amendment, correction or deletion. We strive to protect the security of your personal data by use of appropriate measures and processes.

Customised Experience
We use technology to help us deliver customised visitor experiences. At Dell, we use Dell and third party "cookies" to help us determine which information is appropriate to you and to enhance your experience when you interact with us. Our use of cookies aims to provide you with a better experience when using //www.dell.co.in/ and to serve you customised messages about Dell products and services when you visit the Dell website and other third party websites.

Web Beacons
We, or third parties acting on our behalf, may use web beacons or related technology on our site, in our communications, on other sites, or in our communications in others' messages. A web beacon is an electronic image that can be used to recognise a cookie on your equipment when you view a web page or online communication. Web beacons help us measure the effectiveness of our site and our interactions with you in various ways, for example, by counting the number of individuals who visit our site from a particular communication or make a purchase from our site after viewing a particular message as well as by telling us when a web page is viewed and providing a description of the page where the web beacon is placed. Web beacons also help us measure the effectiveness of our communication campaigns, for example, by counting the number of individuals who open or act upon a message, determining when a message is accessed and determining how many times a message is transmitted onwards.
The information we collect may include personal information, and web beacons allow us to recognise users by accessing Dell cookies. We may also combine the information that we collect through web beacons with other personal information that we have collected from you. We use all of this information to better tailor our interactions with you and we may use this information for other purposes, such as to enable a shopping cart, customise content on our website and internal research purposes. We will not share any personal information collected through Dell web beacons with any third party, except for service providers who act on our behalf and who are contractually prohibited from any other use or disclosure of the information.
We allow third parties to place their own web beacons on our site or in our advertisements if they share Dell's commitment to protecting your privacy and data. You can make some web beacons unusable by rejecting cookies.
Third-Party Sites
Please be aware that other Web sites including sites that may be accessed through our site, e.g., via a hyperlink, may collect personal information about you. This privacy statement does not cover the information practices of those third-party sites linked to //www.dell.co.in/ or any other site.
We use the "" symbol to mark links to third-party sites.
