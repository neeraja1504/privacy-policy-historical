Information Related to Privacy Shield
For details about the Privacy Shield program: https://www.privacyshield.gov/
Delighted complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States, respectively. Delighted has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.
The key goals of Privacy Shield are to inform individuals, both EU and Swiss individuals, about:
the right of individuals to access their personal data the choices and means your organization offers individuals for limiting the use and disclosure of their personal data the requirement for your organization to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements Delighted’s Privacy Shield self-certification does not cover human resources data.
In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Delighted commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal information. EU and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield policy should first contact Delighted at: legal@delighted.com
Delighted has further committed to refer unresolved Privacy Shield complaints to the American Arbitration Association (AAA), an alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your complaint to your satisfaction, please contact the AAA for more information or to file a complaint (contact details below). The services of the AAA are provided at no cost to you.
During the normal provisioning of the Delighted services, no data are transferred between geographical regions. All data are stored in a specific data center chosen by the customer/controller. If there is a case when personal data are transferred from the EU to the United States, it is solely for the purpose of processing as per instructions from the controller.
Delighted provides appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alternation, unauthorized disclosure or access, and understands whether onward transfer is allowed.
Because adequate protection is provided by Privacy Shield participants, contracts with Privacy Shield participants for mere processing do not require prior authorization (or such authorization will be granted automatically by the EU Member States), as would be required for contracts with recipients not participating in the Privacy Shield or otherwise not providing adequate protection.
Delighted self-certifies with Privacy Shield. A self-assessment is signed by a company officer or other authorized representative of the organization at least once a year and made available upon request by individuals or in the context of an investigation or a complaint about non-compliance. Delighted is required to respond promptly to EU or Swiss individual inquiries, and other requests for information from the Department of Commerce relating to its adherence to the Privacy Shield Principles.
Under Privacy Shield, an individual has the possibility, under certain conditions, to invoke binding arbitration for complaints regarding Privacy Shield compliance not resolved by any of the other Privacy Shield mechanisms. Under Privacy Shield, Delighted must respond to individual complaints within 45 days. For additional information, visit: https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-introduction
