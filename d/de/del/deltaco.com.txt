Collection of Personally Identifiable Information You Submit to the Sites
We may collect “Personally Identifiable Information” (which is information that could reasonably be used to identify you personally, such as first and last name, e-mail address, credit card and mobile telephone number) at certain areas of our Sites, such as when you sign-up to receive newsletters, purchase merchandise and gift cards, apply for a job or complete our franchise opportunity inquiry form. We may also collect certain demographic information (such as gender or age) and information about your interests and preferences (collectively, “Demographic Information”). If we combine Demographic Information together with Personally Identifiable Information, then such combined information will be treated as Personally Identifiable Information.

Usage Information Collected
We and our third-party service providers, including analytic companies, use technology that automatically or passively collects certain information whenever you visit or interact with the Sites or one of our advertisements on another website (“Usage Information”). This Usage Information may include your browser type, the URL that referred you to our Sites, and areas within our Sites that you visit, among other information. We may use Usage Information for many purposes, including to enhance our Sites. We collect your IP address or other unique identifier for your Device used to access the Sites (“Device Identifier”). A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device used to access the Sites, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. When we associate Usage Information or a Device Identifier with you, we will treat it as Personally Identifiable Information. We may use the following methods, among others, to collect Usage Information:
1. Cookies. A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Sites. A Flash cookie is a data file placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plugin that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device. Cookies and Flash cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, remembering you and your preferences and tracking your visits to our web pages. If you choose to disable cookies or Flash cookies on your Device, some features of the Sites may not function properly.
2. Web Beacons. Web beacons are small graphic images or other programming code (also known as "1x1 GIFS" or "clear GIFs"). We may include web beacons in our web pages and e-mail messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or e-mail can act as a web beacon. Web beacons may be used for a number of purposes, including to count visitors to the Sites, to monitor how users navigate the Sites, and to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened.
3. Embedded Scripts . An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Sites, such as the links on which you click. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Sites, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.

Information from other sources
We may supplement the information we collect about you on the Sites with outside records from third parties for a variety of purposes, including to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that may be of interest to you. We may combine the information we receive from those sources with information we collect through the Sites. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to any Personally Identifiable Information received from third parties, unless we explicitly state otherwise.
