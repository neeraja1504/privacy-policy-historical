This Privacy Policy aims to clearly outline our policies and procedures for collecting, using, storing and disclosing your personal information. It is important to Deputy that its customers retain their privacy when using our product. To protect the information you share we follow the globally acceptable practices in customer privacy and data storage.
We ask you to read this Privacy Policy to ensure you have a good understanding of how we treat your personal information. In conjunction with this Privacy Policy we ask that you read our Terms of Use, in doing so you understand and acknowledge the Deputy Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.
Users can access the Deputy application (the “Application”) through our website www.deputy.com, subdomain (*.deputy.com), through applications on devices, through APIs, and through third-parties. A “Device” is any computer used to access the Deputy Application, including without limitation a desktop, laptop, mobile phone, tablet, or other consumer electronic device.
