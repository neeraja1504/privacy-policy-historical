Privacy Policy - Depression, Anxiety & Brain Secrets
Effective as of May 24, 2018
Welcome to AutoimmuneSecrets.com (the “Website”), a website is operated by Autoimmune Secrets, LLC (“we” or “us”). Your privacy is very important to us. We made this Privacy Policy to help you know how we collect, use, and share information about you. The practices set forth in this Privacy Policy apply only to this Website. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any other website or service provided by us, our affiliates or clients, unless it appears on such website or service.
By using our Website or any features provided through it, or by providing us your personal information, you accept and agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy. You may not use or otherwise visit our Website unless you agree to this Privacy Policy.
The Information We Collect
We collect information regarding visitors to our Website to help us operate the site, including to process transactions, communicate with visitors, improve the Website and user experiences, and provide better products and services.
The information we collect from visitors to our Website can be categorized as follows:
Personal Information You Give Us. We only collect personally identifying information (or “personal information”) that you voluntarily provide to us. For example, we typically collect personal information from you when you sign up for our newsletter, place an order, respond to a survey, fill out a form, or otherwise contact us. This personal information can help us identify you as an individual, and may include your name, email address, phone number, mailing address, and credit card information. When ordering on our site, as appropriate, you may be asked to enter personal information. You may visit our Website anonymously if you chose not to provide us with any of your personal information.
Automatically collected non-personal information. We may also automatically collect information about you when you visit the Website that does not personally identify you. This non-personal information includes your public Internet Protocol (or “IP”) address, the type of browser or device operating system you use, the website that referred you to our Website, and the amount of time you spend and the specific pages you visit on the Website.
Aggregate information. We may also aggregate information we collect from you with information from other visitors to the Website. For example, such aggregated information may include the number of users who are located in a certain region or have certain characteristics.
How We Use Cookies
We use cookies – small files put on your computer’s hard drive through your web browser (if you allow) – to enable the Website to recognize your specific browser and to gather and remember certain information about you and your interactions with the Website. We may compile and aggregate data from cookies to monitor our traffic to the Website and visitor interactions. We may, from time to time, use this aggregated information to assess the performance of our Website and products, and to improve website experiences and products in the future.
We do not use cookies and similar items to automatically retrieve personal information from your device without your knowledge.
If you want to stop, limit, or undo the placement of cookies that may already be on your computer or device, please refer to and adjust your web browser preferences. The Help feature on most browsers will tell you how to modify your browser’s settings, such as to stop accepting new cookies, notify you when your browser receives a new cookie, or disable cookies altogether. You can find further information regarding cookies at www.allaboutcookies.org. By deleting our cookies or disabling future cookies, you may not be able to access certain areas or features of our Website or some of its functionality may be affected.
Protecting Your Personal Information
Because any system connected to the internet is vulnerable and could be compromised by a hacker or rogue insider, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you provide us. However, take commercially reasonable measures and employ a variety of security measures to ensure that the personal information you disclose to us is kept secure. For example, we may use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and encryption in connection with certain transactions or the storage of certain information.
Sharing Information with Third Parties
In the ordinary course of business, we may share your information or make it accessible to certain third parties. These third parties are people or businesses that we do not own, operate, control, or otherwise are not closely affiliated with us by ownership, management, employment, or similar close relationships.
We do not sell your information to third parties, exchange it with them, or otherwise seek to profit by specifically disclosing your information with third parties. We will only provide your personal information to affiliates and third parties to help us process your personal information for the purposes set out in this policy. We may provide your personal information to affiliates and trusted third parties who assist us in operating our Website, conducting our business, or providing services to you. We may permit our vendors and subcontractors to access your personal information, but only in connection with performing services for us. We do not authorize them to use the information for their own benefit or to contact you directly (except on our behalf).
We may also release your information when we believe doing is required by law or legal process, to enforce our Website policies, or protect ours or another’s rights, property, or safety, and in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual unlawful or otherwise prohibited activities, including, but not limited to, fraud, harassment or other violations of law or the policies of the Website. For example, we reserve the right to disclose your personal information in connection with a bankruptcy proceeding or if we or any of our assets are the subject of a sale or similar corporate transaction, including, but not limited to, a merger, acquisition or change of control.
Unlike your personal information, we may share non-personal information, which does not personally identify you, to third parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.
We may contract with third-party service providers to assist us in better understanding our website’s visitors. Generally, the information provided to or gathered by these service providers will be aggregated non-personal information, such as information gathered from cookies. We do not authorize these service providers to use the information collected on our behalf except to help us conduct and improve our business.

Links to Third-party Websites
From time to time as we so chose, we may include or offer products or services of third parties or links to websites that are not operated by us. These third-party websites maintain their own separate, independent privacy policies. This Privacy Policy does not apply to third-party websites.
We not endorse, verify, or make any representations concerning the accuracy of the information on these third-party websites, or the extent to which they will protect your personal information.

Information you voluntarily disclose or transmit online in a publicly accessible blog, social network or otherwise online may be viewed and used by others. We are unable to control such uses of your personal information, and by using such services you assume the risk that the personal information provided by you may be viewed and used by third parties.

We retain personal information you provide us through the Website for as long as necessary for our business purposes. For example, we may retain such information as long as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, and to enforce our agreements.

If we are made aware that we have received personal information regarding a person under the age of 13, as with any information obtained in violation of this Privacy Policy, we will use reasonable efforts to locate and remove that information from our records.
If you are under 13 years old, you may only use this Website with the involvement of your parent or guardian.
