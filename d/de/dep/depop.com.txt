Depop’s approach to privacy

Depop provides a social media-inspired peer-to-peer marketplace which uses artificial intelligence to suggest relevant sellers and items and to display items to the most relevant potential buyers based on user preferences and other information submitted to it, which you can access via the App and through our website (“Service”). You can search for items, log-in to your profile and view other profiles (each shop has a unique and public URL) via the website. The above information will also be visible to search engines, including but not limited to the photos that you post. When you use our Site or Service we will collect and process certain information about you. This Privacy Policy sets out how Depop collects, uses and shares information that identifies you or is associated with you (“personal information”).

Other users can provide information that is associated with you such as comments, feedback and likes relating to your items and messages they send to you. Other users may also share information relating to an item they have bought from you on the Service on other social media channels which link to the Service, but this will not result in any information that was not already public, being made public.

We may share your personal information with the following parties:
Companies in the same group of companies as us – our subsidiaries (i.e. any organisation we own or control) or our ultimate holding company (i.e. any organisation that owns or controls us) and any subsidiaries it owns. These companies will only use your personal information in the same way as we can under this Privacy Policy.
Service providers – third parties who provide a service to us. These third parties will only be allowed to use your personal information in accordance with our instructions and will be required to keep your information secure. In particular, we may share the personal information you provide to us with shipping providers (where you have chosen to use their services in relation to any items you sell), identity verification service providers (in order to verify your access to the Service and prevent fraudulent activity on your account), moderators who monitor our Service (to ensure our Terms of Service are being adhered to that no criminal activity is taking place using our Service), third party payment providers (for the purposes of processing any sales transactions you have consented to) and Site or Service analytics providers.

If you provide additional information to a service provider directly, then their use of your information is governed by their applicable privacy policy.

Storing and transferring your personal information
Timeframe  – We will only retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
If you have an account with us your Personal Information will be kept by us for as long as your account remains active. If you deactivate your account your personal information will be kept for a reasonable period of time after this so that we can complete any activities already initiated or where we have a need to retain your personal information for legal or technical reasons (including back-up systems) for example to retain proof of transactions for the enforcement of our rights, and to enable the other party to a transaction to access records of past purchases or sales. Following this period we will either delete the information or change it to a form that does not identify you.
For details of retention periods for other aspects of your personal information please contact us at  data@depop.com.
Cookies and local storage  – we may store information (which may include personal information) locally on your device using cookies and other browser and application storage methods. For further information please see our  Cookies Policy.
Transfers outside of your country of residence  – the personal information we collect may be transferred to and stored in countries outside of the EEA including to our affiliates and our third party Service moderators. It may also be processed by staff (who work for us or for one of our suppliers) and other users of the Service operating outside the EEA, in order to fulfil a purchase, process payment details and provide support and verification services. Some of these jurisdictions offer differing levels of protection in respect of personal information and may, in certain instances, be less protective than the UK. However the transfer of your data to other countries in line with this Privacy Policy, shall only be to countries in respect of which an adequacy decision has been issued by the European Commission, or where the entity is bound an appropriate confidentiality and data transfer agreement as deemed adequate by the European Commission (details of which we are happy to share with you on request as per the “Contacting Us” section below). Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal information shared between Europe and the US. If we collect your personal information in Australia, it may also be transferred to and stored in countries outside Australia including to our affiliates and our third party service providers who are located in countries including the UK, USA, and India. We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and any relevant privacy laws. By submitting your personal information, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted through our Service; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.
Your Rights
Right to access your information:  You are entitled to see the information held about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it, and we shall comply with our obligations under applicable data protection legislation in relation to any request by you. We may charge you a reasonable fee or refuse to comply with your request if it is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month (once we have been able to verify your identity). Occasionally it may take us longer than this if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests.
Right to request correction of your information:  You may ask us to make any necessary changes to ensure that the data we hold about you is accurate and kept up to date. Please keep us informed if your personal information changes during your relationship with us.
Right to request erasure of your information:  In certain circumstances you may also ask us to erase personal information relating to you. We may not always be able to comply with your request for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request. You can exercise your right to delete certain personal information about you by closing your account with us, although we may need to keep some information about you in accordance with the “Storing and transferring your personal information” section above.
Right to object to processing:  You may object to use processing your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest where you believe it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. We will consider any such objection, however in some cases we may demonstrate that our legitimate grounds override your rights and freedoms. You may also object to us processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes (see “Your Marketing Preferences” above for further information about how to do this).
Right to restriction of processing:  You may ask us to suspend the processing of your personal information in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
Right to request the transfer of your information:  You have the right to request a transfer of certain of your personal information to you or a third party of your choice, which we will provide in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.
Right to withdraw consent:  Where we are relying on your consent to process your personal information you may withdraw this consent at any time (which you can do by changing the settings in your mobile device in relation to location data or by changing the privacy settings on your social networks in relation to information we collect from those networks).
Right to opt-out of behavioural analytics:  If you do not want us to conduct behavioural analytics for the purposes of Depop’s internal algorithm used to display relevant sellers and items to you or to display your items to the most relevant potential buyers, you must close your Depop account and cease using our Service. This is because it is essential to Depop to suggest the right items and sellers to you and to display your items to the right buyers which we can only do by learning about your tastes and preferences and the types of products you list.
To exercise any of the above rights, or if you have any questions relating to your rights, please contact us by using the details set out in the “Contacting us” section below. We may need to request specific information from you when you exercise your rights to confirm your identity and to speed up our response. We may not be able to fulfil your request if we are not able to identify you.
Most of the personal information we hold about you is either available directly from viewing your account and looking back over your own activities or is available from the social networks that you have connected to our Service. If you think that there is other personal information which you think we hold, please contact us using the contact details set out in the “Contacting us” section below. Please provide as much information as you can about the personal information you are looking for and we will be happy to try and help you find it.
Links to third party sites
The Service may, from time to time, contain links to and from third party websites of our partner networks, advertisers, partner merchants, retailers and affiliates. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for their policies. Please check the individual policies before you submit any information to those websites.
