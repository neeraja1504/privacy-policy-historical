Privacy Policy | VISIT DENVER
Welcome to Denver! The Denver Metro Convention & Visitors Bureau, Inc. (“VISIT DENVER,” “we” or “our”) is committed to maintaining your confidence and trust, and accordingly maintains this privacy policy (“Policy”) that describes how we protect personal information that we may collect about you, informs you about how we collect it, how we use it, with whom we may share it and the choices you have on how it may be used.​
This Policy applies to information collected on our websites, including without limitation denver.org, visitdenver.org, visitdenver.com, and denversports.org (each a “Website”) and any associated content, features and functionality contained on or provided through the Website or any of our mobile applications.
Please read this Policy carefully and on more than one occasion when you use the Website. By accessing and using this Website, mobile application or other Visit Denver product or service on any computer, mobile phone, tablet, console or other device, you signify that you have read and understand the terms of this Policy. If you do not agree with this Policy, you may not access or use the Website.
For your convenience, the Website contains links to other websites not under our control. We do not control, are not responsible for, and this Policy does not apply to, the privacy practices or content of those third-party websites. If you decided to initiate a transaction on a website that our Website links to, even if you reached that website through our Website, the information you submit to complete the transaction becomes subject to the privacy practices of the owner of that linked website. You should seek out, carefully read and understand the website privacy policy of each third-party website you visit. For purposes of applicable data protection laws, VISIT DENVER is the controller of the personal data that you provide to us.  Our business office address is 1555 California Street, Suite 300, Denver, CO 80202 USA.
INFORMATION VISIT DENVER MAY COLLECT FROM YOU
We may collect personal information from you in several different ways on our Website, including through the use of forms for general inquiries, to submit an event, newsletter and travel guide requests, RFP submissions, contests, partnership applications, or through offline contacts such as email, mail or phone calls. This Policy applies to information that you provide to VISIT DENVER through the Website.
We collect this information to provide a more efficient online experience, as well as to provide you with news, travel guides and information, promotional materials and other goods and services that you request. Personal information we may collect from you includes your first and last name, gender, age, language, home or business address, email address, phone number, travel arrangement details, affinity categories, information about your company, guests who will attend an event and any other personal information you provide to us. We also collect personal information about you when you purchase products or services or book travel accommodations through our website. These financial transactions are processed through third-party service providers with whom we partner but do not control, including Booking.com, Authorize.net, SimpleView and Bandwango, and Arrivalist who will collect personal and financial information from you such as credit card and billing address information, but your financial information is not provided to us. The information collected from you by these third parties is governed by the privacy policies of those third parties and we encourage you to review them. Any personal information we maintain to fulfill your purchase order is subject to this Policy.
INFORMATION VISIT DENVER MAY COLLECT AUTOMATICALLY
Like most sites, we may automatically collect personal information through the use of “cookies” (small text files in the memory of your browser or device that enable a website to recognize a user’s device), “pixel tags” (small graphic images that typically work in conjunction with cookies to identify users and user behavior) or similar programs, that track information provided by your browser such as the Internet address of your computer, your mobile device ID, the website you came from, the type of computing, mobile or other device used, to track link clicks, page opens, form submissions, and other data that helps us administer our Website, such as the date, time and page(s) you visited on our Website, the duration of your visit and other anonymous information. Some cookies we use enable us to deliver third-party advertising based on your online activity. Most popular Internet browsers will allow you to configure the browser to reject or block cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set, by accessing the “Help” portion of the toolbar. Please refer to your browser for information on how to disable and control cookies and note that if you reject or block cookies it may affect your ability to enjoy the full functionality of our Website.
USE AND RETENTION OF INFORMATION BY VISIT DENVER
We may use the personal information collected from you in several ways. For example, if you indicate on our Website that you would like to receive information about VISIT DENVER programs and services, are planning a trip to Denver, planning a meeting or event in Denver, requesting that an event be added to our event calendar, booking a hotel reservation, would like to access our digital photo/video asset library, or if you are a travel writer interested in writing about Denver, personal information will be collected and added to our records. To receive some of VISIT DENVER’s information and services, a visitor may also set up an account or submit an RFP in which similar personal information is collected. As another example, we may also use your email address to send you newsletters and other publications that you have requested or we think you will find interesting. We also collect personal information if you enter a contest we sponsor. If you do not wish to provide the requested personal information or if you do not agree to have us use the information for the purposes identified, it is your responsibility to decline use or opt-out of those aspects of our Website for which personal information is sought.
The information we collect automatically when you visit our Website is used to analyze general browsing behavior of visitors to our Website, including the popularity of certain pages, and compile statistical reports on site activity, including the daily requests we receive for particular files and which countries those requests came from, so that we can provide a better Website experience. For example, we can tell which Internet Service Provider our visitors use, but not names, addresses or other information. This information is used only for internal purposes by VISIT DENVER technical support staff. This information may be used to confirm participation in VISIT DENVER advertising and marketing programs, and may be used to advise participants of the numbers of visitors who come to our site from their sites.
We retain personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes of this Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by applicable law or regulation.
SHARING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
VISIT DENVER does not sell or rent your personal information to third parties for marketing purposes without your prior consent. VISIT DENVER may, however, share personal information with our partners for targeted advertising or retargeting purposes.
Personal information will not be released to third parties except to further the purpose for which you provide the information. We may share your personal information with third-party providers that help us provide certain content, services and functionality such as hotel booking, payment processors and publication distribution vendors who would be given access to your personal information solely for the limited purpose of performing the services, or providing the information, you requested and for no other purposes. We may also share your personal information with hotel suppliers to allow the hotels to fulfill your reservation requests that you book through our Website. When booking a hotel through our Website, you should review the privacy policies and terms and conditions of any hotel website at which you book a reservation as we do not restrict the hotel’s use of your personal information. We may also share your personal information with our partner businesses when you request a specific product or service that our partners are best able to provide, such as information on tourist attractions, events and restaurants. Except as expressly stated in this Policy, we will not disclose, including for purposes of sale, any information that we collect to a third party.
Our Website may use Google Analytics, a web analysis service provided by Google, in order to better understand your use of our websites and how we can improve them. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit a website, what pages you visit when you do so, and what other websites you used prior to coming to such website. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit a website, rather than your name or other identifying information. We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with your personal information. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit a website, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to Client websites is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy. Google utilizes the data collected to track and examine the use of the Client websites, to prepare reports on its activities and share them with other Google services. Google may use the data collected on the Client websites to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network. To more fully understand how Google may use the data it collects on the Client websites, please review “How Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps,” (located here or any successor URL).
LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING INFORMATION
Where required by the EU General Data Protection with Regulation 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (“ GDPR ”), we will only collect and process personal information about you where we have a legal basis. Examples of legal bases include consent (where you have given consent), contract (where processing is necessary for entering into or the performance of a contract with you), and “legitimate interests”.
Where we process personal information based on consent, we will ask for your consent. You may withdraw your consent at any time, but that will not affect the lawfulness of the processing of your personal information prior to such withdrawal. Where we rely on contract, we will ask that you agree to the processing of personal information that is necessary for entering into or the performance of your contract with us, and we will inform you whether the provision of your personal data is mandatory and of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information.
We may process your personal information for the purposes of our legitimate interests, provided that such processing does not outweigh your rights and freedoms.  Where we rely on legitimate interests, you have the right to object.  We process your personal information based on legitimate interests in order to:
·         Market our products and services;
·         Protect you, us, or others from data security threats;
·         Comply with laws that apply to us; and
·         Enable or administer our business, such as for invoicing vendors and customers.
DO NOT TRACK SIGNALS
California and Delaware laws require that we indicate whether we honor “Do Not Track” settings in your browser concerning targeted advertising. “Do Not Track” is a standard that is currently under development. As it is not yet finalized, we adhere to the standards set out in this Policy and do not monitor or follow any Do Not Track browser requests.
CHILDREN'S POLICY
The Website is intended for a general adult audience and is not intended for children under 16 years of age. VISIT DENVER does not intentionally collect any personal information from any child under the age of 16 and if we discover we have been provided with any such information, VISIT DENVER will promptly dispose of the information. VISIT DENVER encourages parents and guardians to closely monitor children’s online activities.
INTERNATIONAL VISITORS
VISIT DENVER receives visitors from all over the world. If you are accessing this Website from outside the United State of America, please note that your information may be collected, transferred to, stored or processed in the United States and will be subjected to U.S. laws, which may not afford the same privacy protection as the laws of your own country. By continuing to access the Website, you understand and consent to the transfer of your information to our facilities in the United States and those third parties with whom we share it.  For purposes of applicable data protection laws, we will rely on legally-provided mechanisms to lawfully transfer personal data across borders, including consent and performance of a contract.
SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED
We understand the importance of safeguarding the personal information we collect from you. We therefore take reasonable measures to protect your personal information that is under our control in an effort to prevent its loss, misuse or unauthorized access, alteration or disclosure, including established electronic and administrative safeguards designed to make the information we collect secure. You should take care not to send us personal information in email, which is an inherently insecure form of communication.
Although we strive to keep your information secure, no policy or system can perfectly guard against the risk of intentional intrusion or inadvertent disclosure and we do not and cannot guarantee that your information may never be disclosed in a manner inconsistent with this Policy and applicable laws. Any personal information you provide to us is at your own risk. You should understand the limits to privacy and security on the Internet and use common sense in all of your online activities.
BUSINESS TRANSITIONS
In the event that VISIT DENVER and/or its business units or subsidiaries are ever sold, acquired, merged, liquidated, reorganized or otherwise transferred, we reserve the right to transfer our user databases together with any personal information contained therein to a third party acquiring VISIT DENVER or any of its assets.
QUESTIONS OR OPT-OUT
If at any time you have any questions or change your mind and would like to add or remove your name from the VISIT DENVER mailing list, or update your personal information, or opt out from receiving any further communications from VISIT DENVER, please either (1) call us at 303-892-1112, (2) email us at info@visitdenver.com, (3) write us at VISIT DENVER, the Convention and Visitors Bureau, 1555 California Street, Suite 300, Denver, CO 80202 USA, and/or (4) click on unsubscribe in the email sent to you, where applicable.
EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA (EEA) RESIDENTS
Using the contact details provided above, if you are an EEA resident (specifically, any country in the EU, Lichtenstein, Norway, Iceland), for personal information that we have about you, you can also ask us for a copy of your personal information, ask us to erase or delete all or some of your personal data, ask us to stop using all or some of our personal information or limit our use of it, or ask us for a copy of your personal information provided in machine readable form.
If we have collected and processed your personal information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time.  Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
We do not make use of automated decision-making.  As defined under current data protection laws, automated decisions are defined as decisions about individuals that are based solely on the automated (i.e., no human involvement) processing of data and that produce legal effects or that significantly affect the individuals involved.
You have the right to complain to a data protection (or supervisory) authority about our collection and use of your personal information.  For more information, please contact your local data protection authority. (Contact details for data protection authorities in the EEA and Switzerland are available here.)
