Any reference to a Dentons "location" means any office, associate office, facility, associate firm, or entity with a special alliance with our international legal practice.
Personal data is collected by each member of the Dentons Group. In the European Union our primary data collectors are Dentons UK and Middle East LLP (a UK limited liability partnership with registration number OC322045) and Dentons Europe LLP (a UK limited liability partnership with registration number OC316822) and their affiliates.
