We are committed to protecting your privacy and promise to never spam you. Below is our policy for how the information you share is collected and used.
Why do you collect my personal information?
We collect personal information for the following three reasons...
#1 School Request Forms
Most schools respond very quickly to the information request forms submitted through our site. In order for a school to contact you, your phone number, postal address and email address may need to be provided. We will only share your information with the specific school you requested and/or its authorized agent. We will never redistribute, resell, or share your information with other parties.
#2 Content Subscriptions
If you wish to subscribe to our blog, digital magazine or any of our other premium content, we may ask for contact information such as your name and email address. We may also ask about your particular interests in order to serve you the information you are most interested in. Your contact information is not redistributed, sold or shared with other parties. You may opt-out of these subscriptions for any reason or at any time.
#3 Scholarship Applications
Scholarship applications require basic personal information such as address, phone and email to contact potential award recipients. We may also ask for personal references to verify your information and history. Only top applicants will be contacted solely for the purpose of the scholarship program. Applicant information will be never distributed, sold or shared with other parties.

How do you protect my personal information?
