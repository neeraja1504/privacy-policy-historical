DEEWR Privacy Policy
All personal information collected by the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (DEEWR) is protected by the Privacy Act 1988  (the Privacy Act). Further information about the Privacy Act is available on the Australian Privacy Commissioner’s website.
DEEWR’s Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy embodies the department’s commitment to protecting the privacy of personal information. It applies to personal information collected by the department and its contractors and agents (collectively, the department).
The department adheres to the requirements of the Information Privacy Principles (contained in the Privacy Act) and the Guidelines for Federal and ACT Government Website. These guidelines are issued by the Federal Privacy Commissioner.
Information the department collects and how it uses it
The department helps the Australian Government achieve its overall objective of quality education, employment and workplace relations outcomes for all Australians through:
efficient national program management
effective working relationships with state and territory governments, education departments, non-government education authorities and providers, Indigenous education service providers, employment service provides, industry, community groups and other stakeholders
auditing, research and analysis in order to maintain, protect and improve its services
policy advice and other support to the Minister.
Generally, the department collects personal information in order to properly and efficiently carry out its functions. The department only uses personal information for the purpose(s) for which it was given to the department and for directly related purposes (unless otherwise required by or authorised by law) or as consented to by the individual concerned.
In addition to this general Privacy Policy, where more detailed information is needed to explain its privacy practices in relation to specific types of personal information, the department develops and provides separate privacy notices to describe how it will handle the personal information that it collects in relevant circumstances. For example, where the department asks you to provide personal information in relation to a particular program administered by the department, the department will provide you with a privacy notice which details its practices in relation to that particular program.
Communication - emails and electronic forms
The department’s servers may record your email address if you send the department a message online. Your email address will not be added to a mailing list unless you have provided it to the department in order to subscribe to one of its subscription services, such as the department’s Site Change Subscription Service.
Where you choose to send the department a completed electronic form that includes your personal details, the department collects personally identifiable information such as name, address and email address.
The information collected by email or electronic forms will be used only for the purpose for which you provided it, and the department will not disclose it unless one of the circumstances described below under the heading Information Sharing has been satisfied. For those who do not wish to use the internet, the department provides alternative ways of providing information, for example forms may be printed and lodged by post.

Information security
The department takes all reasonable steps:
to protect the personal information held in its possession against loss, unauthorised access, use, modification, disclosure or misuse
to ensure that, where it has given personal information to a contractor (that carries out a service for the department), the contractor complies with the Information Privacy Principles in the Privacy Act.
Data integrity

Changes to the Privacy Act 1988
The Privacy Amendment (Enhancing Privacy Protection) Bill 2012 was enacted in late 2012. One of the amendments this makes to the Privacy Act is to replace the existing Information Privacy Principles with new Australian Privacy Principles. The new Australian Privacy Principles commence in March 2014.  Over the coming months, the department will be reviewing its Privacy Policy to ensure compliance with the new legal requirements before they commence in March 2014.
Further information
The department is required to submit a Personal Information Digest to the Australian Privacy Commissioner each year which outlines, amongst other things, the sorts of records of personal information that the department holds. The department’s Personal Information Digest is available from the Australian Privacy Commissioner’s website.
