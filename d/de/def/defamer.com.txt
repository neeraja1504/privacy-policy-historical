Gawker.com Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy covers Gawker.com, which is created and owned by Gawker Media LLC (together with any successors, affiliates or subsidiaries, and any of their directors, employees, agents, attorneys, third-party content providers, distributors, licensees or licensors doing business as Gawker or otherwise, “Gawker”, “us” or “we”). The Privacy Policy governs your access to and use of the services, websites, and applications offered by Gawker (the “Services”). Please read this statement carefully before using or proceeding to access Gawker. Your use of Gawker indicates that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy and indicates your agreement to abide by the  Terms of  Service in effect and to be subject to this policy.
1. Information Collection
Gawker or third parties may collect information from our users at several different points on Gawker.
●
Cookies – Gawker or third parties may use cookies, web beacons, HTML5 local storage, JavaScript, and other similar technologies to help us understand how you use the Services and help us provide the Services to you.
●
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s computer tied to information about the user. We may use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once the user closes the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user’s hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following the user’s internet browser help file directions. We may store a cookie on each user’s machine that contains user specific information. You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. If you reject all cookies, you may not be able to take full advantage of all offerings. However, not all Services require that you accept cookies. Use of the Services may execute code known as a “web beacon.” This code allows us to understand the time and date of when a user has opened an email. Our web beacons do not collect personally identifiable information.
●
Links – The Services may contain links to other sites. Some of these links may be affiliate marketing links encoded by third parties. Such third parties do not collect any personally identifiable information unless you visit the referenced site. Please be aware that Gawker is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by Gawker.
●
Embedded Content — You should also be aware that some content delivered through the Services originates with another content provider. Such other content providers may place “cookies” on your computer, or otherwise gather information about you, including by asking you to provide information through the content player itself. Again, it is up to you to review the terms of use and privacy policy of the originators of such content.
●
Data that we collect may be shared with our prospective and actual business partners, advertisers, and other third parties for business purposes. Other than names and email addresses provided at your discretion, we don’t generally collect any “Personally Identifying Information” about our users (such as social security number, telephone number, street address, driver’s license number, etc.). However, we may offer you the opportunity to submit other information about yourself (such as gender, age, occupation, hobbies, interests, zip code, etc.), which would then also be covered by this Privacy Policy.
●
Log Files – Like most standard website servers we use log files to log certain information about how you use Gawker. This information may be stored on third party servers, and may be used by Gawker or its third party service providers in order to assess general user interest in various internal and third party products and services. We do not, however, collect IP addresses or log IP address information.
●
We do not respond to web browser “do not track” or other related mechanisms at this time.
●
Ad Serving – The ads that may appear on these websites are delivered to you by a web advertising vendor and/or by Gawker’s own proprietary advertising delivery software. In order to serve ads to you, we may use information collected during your searches or visits to our websites and information that we specifically acquire from third parties.
●
Advertising and Cookies – Some of our third party advertising partners may distribute cookies to users in advertisements that are provided to us. Gawker has no access to or control over these cookies once we have received the advertisements. Some of these advertisers and services we use to deliver advertising may be engaging in online behavioral advertising as defined by the Digital Advertising Alliance and FTC.
●
Affiliate Advertising – We may participate in affiliate advertising and allow affiliate links to be encoded on some of our pages. This means that we may earn a commission when you click on or make purchases via affiliate links, and affiliate partners may use cookies to understand your use of the Services.
●
Gawker does not provide any Personally Identifiable Information to third-party advertising companies. Note, however, that if an advertiser asks Gawker to show an advertisement to users with certain characteristics (for example, women ages 18-24) or a segment of that group (for example, women ages 18-24 who have viewed certain categories of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the third-party advertising company may conclude that you have the characteristics of the audience that they are trying to reach.
●
Opt-out – As part of our commitment to transparency and your privacy, we provide the following links to opt-out of cookies provided by both our first party ad server and many third party advertising partners who may be engaging in online behavioral advertising:

In the event Gawker goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of a portion of its assets, data we collect, including users’ personal information, will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred.
4. Legal Disclaimer
Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, Gawker may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on Gawker or affiliates. If we’re going to turn over information related to you, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide you with advance notice, unless we are prohibited from doing so by law or court order.
5. Information Security
Gawker has technical, administrative and physical safeguards in place to help protect against unauthorized access to, use or disclosure of user information we maintain. Sensitive records are to be retained only as long as necessary for business or legal needs and destroyed before disposal. Although we work hard to protect personal information that we collect and store, no program is one hundred percent secure and we cannot guarantee that our safeguards will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use or disclose personal information.
If you become aware of a security issue, please email us at gawkerterms@gawker.com. We will work with you to address any problems.
6. Notification of Changes
Whenever Gawker changes its privacy policy, we will post those changes to this Privacy Policy page, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. You are responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any changes to this Privacy Policy.
7. Contact Information
If you have any questions or suggestions regarding our privacy policy, please contact us at gawkerterms@gawker.com, or by mail to 10 East 53rd Street, 33rd Floor, New York, New York 10020.
8. Last Update
This Privacy Policy is effective as of September 9, 2016.
