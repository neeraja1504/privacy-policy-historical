We may also collect information about your activities or postings on FFN Website when you choose to send us personal correspondence such as emails or letters or when other FFN Website users or third parties send us correspondence, which may include their comments about you. All this information will be kept in a file that is accessed only by authorized FFN personnel or representatives.
On some of the FFN Websites, you may choose to use our referral service to tell a friend or friends about us. In this case, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address and email your friend an invite to him or her to visit an FFN Website.
Providing your Personal Information to us is voluntary. However, if you do not provide your Personal Information to us, you will not be able to access some or all of our services.

When you provide Personal Information to us, we will use it to contact you about our services, to process payment for our services, and to tailor our services to your meet your preferences.
We use your Personal Information for many specific purposes, including:
emailing you with news and updates about the FFN Websites improving and customizing our content and product offerings analyzing FFN Website usage and delivering information (such as banners and promotions) targeted to your interests providing you with information about the products and services provided by the FFN Websites or third parties If you have provided us with certain Personal Information, we will also use it to facilitate your communication with other members, for example, by the use of the message center or delivery of "Cupid Reports" or "Ice Breakers".
We may also use your Personal Information to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, enforce any agreements, policies and rules governing the use of FFN Websites, and observe the FFN Websites for quality control and customer service purposes.

Your friend(s) may use the unsubscribe function in the email or contact us at privacy@friendfindernetworks.com to request that we remove their email address from our records.
When and to Whom Will We Disclose Your Information?
Due to the nature of many of the services provided by the FFN Websites, certain of your Personal Information will be disclosed to other Members. As an example, if you complete a "dating" profile and choose to disclose your religious affiliation or ethnic origin, this information will be available to other Members using the services on the applicable FFN Website. By providing this type of profile information to us, you have consented to the use and disclosure of your Personal Information in this manner.
We may share or transfer your Personal Information with our subsidiaries operating other FFN Websites so that they can send you information about their products or services that you may be interested in.
We also disclose Personal Information to our service providers (for example, credit card processing companies, billing services) as reasonably necessary or appropriate to provide services on the FFN Websites. Our service providers are legally required by us to protect your Personal Information. Because many of the FFN Websites operate or use service providers located in different countries, your Personal Information may be transferred to a country in which you do not reside, and while in that foreign country, may be accessible to its law enforcement authorities.
We may be required to disclose your Personal Information in order to comply with a court order, subpoena, search warrant, or as otherwise compelled by law. In addition, we expressly reserve the right to disclose your Personal Information when we have a good faith belief that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, to enforce our agreements, policies, and rules governing your use of the FFN Websites, to cooperate with law enforcement, and/or to report information concerning a threat of serious injury or death.
We DO NOT sell or rent any of your Personal Information to third parties for marketing purposes without your express permission or consent.

When you provide your Personal Information and Sensitive Personal Information to us, you consent to our use and disclosure of that information as described in this Policy. If you do not want us to use or disclose your Personal Information as described in this Policy, do not provide it to us. We note that this may result in you being unable to access some or all of our services.
