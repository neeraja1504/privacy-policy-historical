payment information (e.g. credit card).
Information DANIER collects about you : In order to provide our Service via the Internet, we collect the following information from you:
Internet Protocol (" IP ") address used to connect your computer to the Internet;
computer, device and connection information, such as browser type and version, operating system, mobile platform, screen resolution, language, unique device identifier (“ UDID ”) and other technical identifiers;
uniform resource locator (" URL ") click stream data, including date and time, title of web page, and content you viewed or searched for on a Service; and
location information for any of our location-aware Service to provide you with more relevant content for where you are in the world.
Cookies and Web Beacons : The Service may also automatically collect information through the use of cookies or similar technologies, such as web beacons.  Cookies are small text files that a website sends to the browser on your computer or mobile device when you first visit a web page so that the website can recognize your device the next time you visit. In general, cookies, web beacons and similar technologies do not contain personally identifiable information, but when you furnish your personal information through the Service, this information may be linked to the non-personally identifiable data stored in cookies sent to your browser from the Service.
DANIER and our service providers use these technologies for various purposes, including: facilitating the login process, administering, customizing and improving the Service, personalizing the browsing experience; advertising (including retargeting), promotions and surveys, reporting and tracking and analyzing user preferences and trends.
Our HTML-formatted emails may contain a web beacon to tell us whether our emails are opened and verify any clicks through to links or advertisements within the email. We may use this information for purposes including determining which of our emails are more interesting to users, to query whether users who do not open our emails wish to continue receiving them and to inform our advertisers in aggregate how many users have clicked on their advertisements. The web beacon will be deleted when you delete the email. Emails in plain text rather than HTML will not include the web beacon.
There are a number of ways to manage cookies. The “help” portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new browser cookie, and how to disable existing browser cookies.  However, if you block cookies, you may not be able to register, login or make full use of the Service. You can also use your mobile device’s settings to manage the available privacy options.
Mobile Information : We offer mobile applications which allow you to shop online, check product availability, learn about store events, or receive other information from us. All Personal Information collected via our mobile application is governed by this Privacy Policy. We, or our service providers, may also collect, use, or disclose Personal Information and other information from and about you on our mobile websites and through your interactions with us on your mobile device. This information may include a telephone number and mobile device identifier provided by your mobile device or wireless carrier, as applicable. You do not have to provide your location information to use our mobile applications however, store-specific services require a postal code to function and we will save your postal code for future reference. When you download our mobile application, you may choose to allow it to obtain your precise location. In this case, we will determine your postal code from the precise location data received from your mobile device. We do not store precise location data; we only store the postal codes associated with the location. Our mobile applications offer automatic (push) notifications. We will provide push notifications only to those who opt-in to receive them. If you have questions about location and notification privacy, please contact your mobile service provider or the manufacturer of your device to learn how to adjust your settings. We may offer updated or enhanced versions of our mobile applications that include additional features created by us or using third party functionality. Our applications or the third party may automatically collect information about your precise location from your device, but only if you allow it.
In the event that you have submitted Personal Information about another individual to us, you represent and warrant that you have obtained any and all consent required by Applicable Laws to do so.
