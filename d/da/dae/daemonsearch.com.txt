We count, track, and aggregate our visitors' activities in our analysis of general traffic flows at the Site (e.g., tracking where users come from, what pages they select within the Site, how they interact with search results, etc.).
Information about the search queries you submit to the Site and how you interact with search results may also be used to personalize the content and advertisements that we present to you.

We use cookies to track traffic flow and patterns of travel within and among the Site as well as websites in the Sponsored Listings network.
