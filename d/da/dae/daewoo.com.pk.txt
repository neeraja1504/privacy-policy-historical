We may collect personal information including, but not limited to, your title, name, gender, email address, telephone number, mobile number, payment details, payment card details or mobile wallet account details.
We will use the information you provide to enable us to process your orders and to provide you with the services and information offered through our website/mobile app and which you request. Further, we will use the information you provide to administer your account with us; verify and carry out financial transactions in relation to payments you make online; audit the downloading of data from our website/mobile app; improve the layout and/or content of the pages of our website/mobile app and customize them for users; identify visitors on our website/mobile app; carry out research on our users' demographics; send you information we think you may find useful or which you have requested from us, including information about our services, provided you have indicated that you have not objected to being contacted for these purposes.
Payments that are made through the website/mobile app will be processed by our relevant agent. However, we do not store any credit card or bank detail information on our server. This information is stored with the bank on their secure servers and we are only given an identifier.
You undertake to treat the personal access data confidentially and not make it available to unauthorized third parties. We cannot assume any liability for misuse of passwords unless this misuse is our fault.
If you choose to provide us with personal information, you consent to the transfer and storage of that information on our servers.
