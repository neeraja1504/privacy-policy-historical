Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it.

6. How long do we retain personal data for?
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data so that it can no longer be associated with you, in which case we may use such information without further notice to you.
Once you are no longer a client, we will retain your personal data in accordance with our data retention policy and applicable laws and regulations.
7. Requesting access to your data
You have a right to request access to the personal data that we hold about you. This could include information relating to service purchases.
If you have questions in relation to your personal data, please contact us.
8. Your Right to be Forgotten
You have a right to be forgotten and have data erased and / or stop being processed where the personal data is no longer necessary for the purpose of collection, you withdraw consent, when you object to the processing or to comply with a legal obligation.
We will not erase your records as we need to maintain your transactional data for our legal obligations to the local tax and revenue authorities. The records will be anonymised to overwrite your personal data with fictional names, addresses and emails, making it impossible to restore a single client.
We have a number of security and governance protections in place that will be excluded from your right to be forgotten:
• Encrypted system backups, held for up to 10 years.
• Our anti-spam and email gateway. We maintain email archiving for security reasons, and your info may be kept in this archive. Access to this gateway is limited to named data controllers for DavidsonMorris.
If you have questions in relation to your personal data, please contact us.
9. Right to restrict processing
You have a right for your personal data to be stored but not processed. This is achieved through the withdrawal of consent.
If you have questions in relation to your personal data, please contact us.
10. Security of your personal data
We are committed to taking appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect your personal data against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage to personal data. When you provide your personal data through our website or systems, this information is transmitted across the internet securely using high-grade encryption.
The information that you provide to us will be held in our systems, which are located on our premises or those of an appointed third party. We may also allow access to your information by other third parties who act for us for the purposes described in this Privacy Notice or for other purposes approved by you.
We are based in the UK, but the data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (“EEA“). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff maybe engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.
All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to the site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.
We will retain your personal data for as long as we need it in order to fulfil our purposes set out in this Privacy Notice or in order to comply with the law.
11. Cookies and other tracking technologies

We may share your personal information with certain trusted third parties in accordance with contractual arrangements in place with them, including:

We will use reasonable endeavours to notify you before we do this, unless we are legally restricted from doing so.
We may disclose your personal information to third parties in the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets, and if DavidsonMorris Limited or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by it about its customers will be one of the transferred assets.
