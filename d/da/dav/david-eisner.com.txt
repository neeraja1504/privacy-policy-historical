Earnings Disclaimer
The Earnings Disclaimer on this page is valid for ALL pages and posts hosted on the domain backpackbusinessman.com or any site controlled by PAXMAN LLC that links to this page, hereinafter, “This Site”. This Disclaimer supersedes any other texts or images published on This Site or and any site controlled by PAXMAN LLC that links to this page. Any report or claim of income published on This Site is for informational purposes only. No guarantees of income are being made on This Site at any time, regardless of colorful language. You may or may not make money in any business venture talked about on this site and any site controlled by PAXMAN LLC. Any results you see on this website are not typical.
That’s the legal speak – here’s my straight-talk to YOU as a person: I only believe that money is spent in exchange of VALUE. I don’t think making money needs to be hard, but it needs to be based on substance. In business and in marketing, you usually need to put in some work to see a payoff, even a small one. In fact, it’s usually only small payoffs (if any) that come at the beginning of your business venture. Succeeding at any business, online or otherwise, will most likely require investment and re-investment of your time, energy, and money. It will probably also require dedication, perseverance, and a strategy. The government requires me to state the obvious to cover my butt – but you know better and I know it. Strategic action partnered with a positive state of mind will go further than any guarantees (you know, the ones I’m not making).
