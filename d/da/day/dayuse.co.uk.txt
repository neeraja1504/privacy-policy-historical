2. WHAT TYPE OF PERSONAL DATA DOES DAY USE COLLECT?
Since you'd like to find out more, here is a more detailed overview of the information we collect.
2.1. Personal data that you share with us
DAY USE collects and uses the information that you give us. When you make a Reservation, you must at least provide a surname, first name, phone number and email address. If you need to contact our Customer Service or if you get in touch through other channels (for example on social media), we will also collect data (at least your surname and first name). Clients may also be invited to give feedback to help other users find what they're looking for more easily. We will collect information about you that is included in your comments. You may also provide information on other occasions. For example, if you search for something on your computer or mobile phone, you may allow DAY USE to see your location (geo-tracking). This information helps us offer you the best services and experiences we can. You can also open a very convenient user account which lets you record personal parameters, review previous reservations, plan and manage future reservations, or even take advantage of other features that are only accessible to account holders.
2.2. Personal data about other people that you share with us
You may not only make a Reservation for yourself, but also for other people traveling with you, and about whom you provide information as part of the Reservation process, or you may make a Reservation for someone else. This information can only be used in the way in which it is described on the given platform. We must however highlight that you are responsible for making sure that the person (people) about whom you have provided personal data are aware of this and that they understand and accept the way in which DAY USE uses their data (as explained in this Privacy Policy).
2.3. Personal data that we collect automatically
When you visit one of our websites, even if you don't make a Reservation, we automatically collect information, such as your IP address (which enables us to determine your geographic location, so you can be redirected to the most relevant domain name), the date and time at which you connect to our services, the equipment, software or web browser you are using, as well as information about your computer's operating system, like your application version and language parameters. We collect information on your clicks and on the page you visit. If you are using a mobile phone, data identifying your device, parameters and features, application crashes and other system activities is also collected. When you make a Reservation, our system identifies the way in which and the website from which you accessed the DAY USE site and/or applications, or how you made your booking.
2.4. Personal data that we receive from other sources
Our information is not limited to information that you give us. We may also receive information about you from other sources, including from third parties and business partners. Anything we receive from them may be linked to information that you provide. For example, DAY USE reservation services are not only accessible from Dayuse.com websites and the DAY USE application. They are also integrated into the services of affiliated partners which you can find online. When you use these services, you may be providing reservation details to our business partners, who then transfer the information over to us. We can also integrate the services of third-party suppliers in order to manage payments between clients and hotels. These suppliers may share some of your personal data to help us manage your Reservation and provide you with an optimal experience. Hotels share information about you with DAY USE. This is the case if you have questions about your Reservation or if there is a dispute about a reservation (even though we don't like it when this happens).
3. CAN YOU REFUSE TO SHARE YOUR PERSONAL DATA WITH DAY USE?
Sharing your personal data with DAY USE is done on a voluntary basis. However, depending on the type of service that you wish to use, some services may need to collect some of your personal information. For example, we can't process your hotel Reservation without recording a surname, first name, phone number, and email address. Mandatory information marked with ().

- Even if you have no upcoming Reservation, you may receive administrative messages, such as security alerts.
F. Market surveys:
we sometimes invite our clients to participate in market surveys. You are of course free to accept or refuse to participate in this type of survey. Your participation may justify a different way of processing your personal data. When you are invited to participate, please review the information we provide and make sure you understand which personal data will be collected and how it will be used.
G. Improving our services:
we also use personal data for analytical purposes to improve our services, your user experience, our service features and quality, as well as to carry out tests and resolve issues.

In some cases, we may need to share your personal data with other parties. These parties can include:
- The hotel you have booked: this is a crucial element for us! To complete your Reservation, we pass on all booking contact information needed by the reserved hotel. Depending on the Reservation and on the hotel, this can include your surname and first name, address, payment information, and your preferences or other information you shared with us when making your Reservation. If you have a request regarding your Stay, we may contact the hotel to ask them to process your request.

12. COOKIE INFORMATION
Each time you use our online services, including applications, cookies and other tracking technology is used in several ways. They enable the Dayuse.com website to operate, analyse traffic, or are used for advertising purposes. This technology is used directly by us and our business partners, including third party service providers and advertisers with whom we work. Below is more information about cookies, their use, and how to manage them.
12.1. What are cookies?
Cookies are a small quantity of data that a website installs in your computer's browser or on your mobile device. "Internal cookies" are placed by the server that is responsible for the relevant domain. Dayuse.com cookies are therefore "internal cookies." When we authorise other servers to place cookies on DAY USE websites and applications, these cookies are called "third party cookies."
It's also important to distinguish session cookies from permanent cookies. Session cookies cease to exist when you close your browser, while permanent cookies have a longer life span and are not automatically deleted when you close your browser. We make sure we place cookies or authorise placing cookies for a maximum period of 13 months. A cookie's life span can only be longer in exceptional circumstances and in cases of absolute necessity, for example for security reasons.
Similar tracking technology is also used. It can include web beacons (also known as invisible pixels, web bugs, or gifs), tracking URLs or software development kits (SDKs). A web beacon is a small one-pixel graphic image that can land on your computer as a web page request, on an application, in an advertisement or in an HTML email. Invisible pixels can be used to collect information from your computer, such as the type of hardware or operating system you are using, the IP address or browsing time. They also make it possible to place and read cookies on your browser. Tracking URLs are used to find out which website redirected you to DAY USE websites or applications. Software development kits are small code elements that are found in applications. Their function is similar to that of cookies and of web beacons.
For the purposes of this document, all these technologies are called "cookies."
12.2. How are cookies used?
Cookies are used for different purposes. They allow you to identify yourself as a unique user when you browse across several website pages, different websites, or on an application. The kind of information we collect using cookies includes your IP address, your device identifier, pages that you access, your browser type, browsing information, your operating system, Internet provider, time stamp, whether you are responding to an advert, the referring URL, features that are used or activities you engage in on the website or applications.
Cookies used on our website and applications have several functions:
Technical cookies: we do our best to propose an efficient and easy-to-use website, and applications that adapt to our visitors' wishes and needs. We use technical cookies to feature our website and make sure that it works well. They also help you create your account, connect, make a booking and manage your reservations. Technical cookies are absolutely crucial to the proper functioning of our website.
Session cookies: they help us identify whether you are logged on, link a reservation that is in progress, configure your language and currency, provide a website version that is adapted to the device you are using (mobile phone, tablet, computer). We may also use cookies to memorise your credentials, which avoids you having to enter them each time your visit our website. Passwords are always encrypted. Cookies are not crucial to the proper functioning of our website or applications, but they offer additional features and improve your Dayuse.com experience.
Analytical cookies: we use these cookies to watch how users use Dayuse.com, find out what works and what doesn't, and optimise our website and application. They also help us gauge the impact of our adverts and communication, and ensure that we are always proposing interesting, relevant services. Data that we collect includes the pages you visit, open, and leave, the type of platform you are using, emails that you've opened and which led you to act, as well as the date and time.
This also means we can use information about the way you interact with the website, like the number of clicks per page, how your mouse moves, page scrolling, and search terms you enter in various fields. We also use analytical cookies as part of our online advertising campaigns to find out how users behave on our website or apps after seeing an online advert, including adverts on third party websites. Our partners may also use analytical cookies to find out if their users access hosting offers that are included in their website.
Advertising cookies: we use our own cookies as well as third party cookies to post adverts to our website and other sites. This is called retargeting, a technique based on terms you have searched for on our website, such as destinations, the hotels you viewed and rates that appeared.
12.3. How do I manage them?
To find out more about how we use cookies and how you can manage or delete them, please visit allaboutcookies.org and your browser's help section. Settings in browsers such as Internet Explorer, Safari, Firefox or Chrome let you choose which cookies to accept or block. These settings are located in different areas depending on your browser. If you don't know where to find them, try using the "Help" feature.
If you'd rather block some technical and/or functional cookies, some of our website's features may not work.
Advertising. With regards to marketing or online advertising companies, we do our utmost to work with organisations that belong to the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) or the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB). NAI and IAB members comply with strict ethical standards and charters in their field. They allow you to block advertising that is based on user behaviour. Visit www.networkadvertising.org to find NAI members who may have placed advertising cookies on your computer.
