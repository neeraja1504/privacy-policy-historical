DAYTUM
Information We Gather
The information we gather falls into three categories: 1) personal information you voluntarily supply when you subscribe, post data points, complete fields for data entry, provide your e-mail address, or, in the future if such services become available, register for an online discussion, or enter a contest, 2) credit card or other billing information for subscription services, and 3) tracking information collected as you navigate through our sites.
USE OF INFORMATION THAT YOU PROVIDE
• If you have registered online to our site, Daytum will not sell, rent, swap or authorize any third party to use your e-mail address without your permission. This also applies to any information that personally identifies you, except as noted immediately below. We may, however, share information about our audience in aggregate form. For example, we may want to know how long the average reader spends on our site, or which pages or features get the most attention.
• Daytum may use your contact information to market to you, and provide you with information about our products and services, including but not limited to our Service. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such information or communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications.
• Daytum may perform statistical analyses of subscribers and their subscribing and site use patterns for product development purposes and to generally inform third parties about the nature of our subscriber base.
• We contract with other companies to provide services on our behalf, including credit-card and billing processing, e-mail distribution, list processing and analytics.
• Information you disclose when posting to the website, along with your screen name and photo or image, is public and may be used by Daytum for online and offline promotional or commercial uses in any and all media. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you retain all rights to your data, consistent with the Terms of Use, which shall prevail.
• Daytum Plus paid subscriptions are available for purchase pursuant to the Terms of Use. Paid Subscribers to the Daytum Plus Premium Services may elect to protect information posted to the website, and that information is not publicly-available, subject to the Terms of Use and other explicit limitations set forth herein.
PRIVATE POSTING OF INFORMATION
For Daytum users who are NOT a Member of Daytum Plus, postings of user information, data entries and displays are publicly accessible and there is no limiting who may or may not see your information. You agree and understand that anything that you post under this service will be made available to anyone who visits the Daytum site and may be viewed by the general public.
Paid Subscribers to Daytum Plus : Subscribers to Daytum Plus Premium Services pay to have the right to restrict authorized public access to their data entries and displays. IF A DAYTUM PLUS SUBSCRIBER RESCINDS ITS DAYTUM PLUS SUBSCRIPTION, BY CANCELLATION OR BY FAILURE TO MAKE PAYMENT, THEN THE PREMIUM SERVICES WILL END. AS A PRACTICAL MATTER, DAYTUM WILL FREEZE THE ACCOUNT, WHICH SHOULD KEEP INFORMATION PRIVATE. HOWEVER, IT IS BEST PRACTICES FOR YOU TO DELETE ANY INFORMATION THAT YOU DO NOT WISH TO BECOME PUBLIC PRIOR TO CANCELLING YOUR SUBSCRIPTION OR ALLOWING SUCH SUBSCRIPTION TO LAPSE as this policy may be subject to change over time. Please note also that, like any website, no security measure is foolproof. If someone, such as a computer hacker, is highly motivated to access your information, they may be able to find a way to access it. They will have likely violated applicable laws such as the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and, as such, they will have likely exposed themselves to liability. Daytum makes reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized access to the private information of Daytum Plus subscribers, but you acknowledge that there is some risk of posting sensitive private information and you acknowledge that you assume this risk.
