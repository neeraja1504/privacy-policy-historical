Content that you create through or upload to the Website will by default be public and available to users of the Website and the Services. Similarly, if you comment on any Content (as defined in the Terms of Use) on the Website or the Services, your comments will be public and available to users of the Website and the Services.
We may share data about our users or the use of the Website or Services with our advertisers and partners. This means that we may tell our advertisers general information about the characteristics of our user base, but we do not specifically identify a particular user or visitor by name or provide the user’s contact information. We may share your unique device ID and/or your location (based on opt-in location-based services, which rely upon a device’s GPS coordinates) with third parties, including advertisers and partners, or provide reports to such parties about the number of unique users who saw or clicked on their advertisements. We may also share certain information such as cookie data with third-party advertising partners. This information, among other things, allows third-party ad networks to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.
We may disclose your information on a confidential basis to non-affiliated service providers we engage to perform services for Bigtree in connection with the Website and our provision of the Services. Information will be shared with such service providers only to the extent reasonably necessary for them to perform such services.
Regardless of any choices you make regarding any personally identifiable data you provide, we may preserve and disclose your information if we believe in good faith that we are required to do so in connection with any legal investigation, or by law or regulation, including in response to a court order, subpoena or other legal demand or request.
Regardless of any choices you make regarding any personally identifiable
data/information you provide, we may preserve and disclose your information
if we believe in good faith that it is reasonably necessary to protect the safety
of any person, to address fraud, security or technical issues, to protect
Bigtree’s rights or property, and/or to investigate or assist in preventing any
violation or potential violation of the law, this Privacy Policy, or our Terms of
Use.

obligations regarding your information as described in this Privacy Policy.

been anonymized by or for Bigtree so that it does not allow a third party to
easily identify a specific individual) and/or Aggregated Data (i.e., your
information/data that has been combined by or for Bigtree into anonymous
groups of users where the groups are large enough to reasonably prevent
individual users from being identified) records from the information/data you
provide by excluding information (such as your name) that makes the data
personally identifiable to you. We use this Anonymous and Aggregated Data
to analyze request and usage patterns so that we may enhance the content of
our Services and improve Website navigation. We reserve the right, in our
sole discretion, to use Anonymous and/or Aggregated Data for any purpose

purpose.

secure or error-free. In particular, messages sent to or from this Website may
not be secure. Please notify us as soon as possible if you suspect that there
is any breach of security.
4. ADVERTISING
Bigtree displays targeted advertisements. When an advertiser books an ad
placement on the Website, they are given the opportunity to choose their
audience by location, demographics, gender and any other non-personally
identifiable information we receive or collect from you.

the advertiser may make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria
used to display the ad. Please note that this Privacy Policy in no way restricts
or limits our collection and use of aggregate information which is data we
collect about your use of our Website or about a group or category of services
or users, from which individual identities or other personally identifiable
information has been removed.
Advertisers may sometimes place their own cookies on your computer in
order to make their ads more effective.
Please remember that any personal information you provide on the linked
pages, ads you click on or other websites is subject to a third party’s privacy
policy. This Privacy Policy does not apply to such linked websites, ads you

Also, third party ad networks may serve ads on our Website or provide ads via
our services and/or otherwise place cookies, web beacons or other devices or
technologies on our Platforms (or via our Services) to enable them to
automatically collect non-personal information about you and your visits to our
Website and to other websites, your IP address, your ISP and the browser
you use to visit our Website and other websites. Information collected may be
used, among other things, to analyze data, to deliver content and advertising
on our Website or other websites (including content and advertising that is
targeted to your interests), to determine the popularity of certain content, and
