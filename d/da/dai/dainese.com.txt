After consulting this Website, data concerning identified or identifiable persons may be processed. Processing of data, which may directly or indirectly identify you, will be carried out only where strictly necessary. The Website has therefore been configured in such a way as to ensure that the use of Personal Data has been minimised and to exclude processing of personal data when the purposes pursued in the individual cases can be achieved by using anonymous data (for example, market research aimed at improving services) or carried out in other ways, which enable identification of the data subject only where strictly necessary or required by the authorities and police forces (for example, for data relating to traffic, time spent on the Website or your IP address).
The “Data Controller” for processing is Dainese S.p.A. – Via dell’Artigianato n. 35 – 36060 Molvena (VI).

Personal data provided by Users who submit requests to be sent informational materials (commercial or technical information, newsletters, etc.) are used exclusively for the purposes indicated in the information statements in the sections regarding the Website, and are disclosed to third parties only if this is necessary for that purpose.

Types of data processed
Navigation data
During normal operation, the IT systems and software procedures used to run this Website acquire some personal data, whose transmission is implicit to the use of Internet communication protocols.

Such data are used for the sole purpose of obtaining anonymous statistical data on the use of the Website and checking its correct operation, and are immediately deleted after processing. The data might be used to ascertain responsibility in the event of hypothetical computer crimes against the Website.
Data voluntarily provided by the User
The optional, explicit and voluntary sending of e-mails to the addresses indicated on this Website implies the subsequent acquisition of the sender's address, required to reply to requests, and of any other personal data included in the message.
