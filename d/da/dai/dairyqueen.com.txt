Privacy Statement - Dairy Queen
Effective April 2, 2019
This privacy statement applies to the following websites: dairyqueen.com, dq.com, dq.ca, orangejulius.com, dqcakes.com (the “Websites”).
By using any of these Websites, you accept and agree to the terms stated below. We may change the terms of this privacy statement at any time, and the continued use of the Websites is your agreement to any change in the privacy statement.
Collection & Use of Information
We collect information through the Websites in several different ways.
Information You Submit. You give us personal information when you join one of our loyalty clubs, enter one of our surveys, contests or sweepstakes, if you submit a question, comment or complaint, if you request or submit information about becoming a franchisee, if you submit an employment application, or for an online cake order. “Personal information” means any information about an identifiable individual, such as name, address, phone number, email, birth date, or gender. Except with your consent or as required or permitted by law, we will use the information you submit for the purposes for which it is submitted or as otherwise described in this privacy statement. If you join one of our loyalty clubs, you may receive newsletters, email or special offers, which you may unsubscribe from at any time using the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the email.
Most of our locations are independently owned and operated franchises, and we do not own or operate these locations. Comments, questions or complaints submitted to us about a specific location will be forwarded to the franchised location, along with any contact information you provide with your comment. If you have comments regarding a specific location, we recommend you contact that location directly so that they may personally and immediately assist you. We do not guarantee the privacy practices of any specific franchised location.
Information Collected by Automated Means. We collect and use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the Websites, track user movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. In some circumstances, an IP address may be considered personal information. We also collect information using cookies. Cookies are pieces of data your web browser stores on your hard drive that we use to improve your user experience on the Websites. We and our third party vendors may also use cookies to provide you with our advertising messages on other websites you visit; these third party vendors may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites based on these cookies. These activities provide us with important marketing information and lets us know how we are doing at attracting new visitors and maintaining relationships with our existing visitors. If you wish, you can set your browser to refuse cookies or delete any existing cookies from your computer, but this may negatively impact your experience on the Websites. Our third party vendors may collect additional information by automated means when you visit the Websites, such as browser type or operating system.
Information About Third-Party Cookies and Interest-Based Advertising
In addition to the cookies we deliver to your computer or mobile device through the Websites, certain third parties may deliver cookies to you for a variety of reasons. For example, we use Google Analytics, a web analytics tool that helps us understand how visitors engage with the Websites. To learn more about Google Analytics, click here. Other third parties may deliver cookies to your computer or mobile device for the purpose of tracking your online behaviors over time across nonaffiliated websites, or for delivering targeted advertisements either on the Websites or on other websites.
You have choices about the collection of information by third parties on the Websites. For example, if you don’t want information about your visit to the Websites sent to Google Analytics, you may download an Opt-out Browser Add-on by clicking here. Please note that the Add-on does not prevent information from being sent to us.
In addition, if you would like to opt out of having participating entities collect your online behavior for advertising purposes when you are browsing the Websites, click here for a “Website Opt Out.” You will be directed to an industry-developed website that allows you to choose whether each listed entity may collect and use data for interest-based advertising purposes. It may be that some of the third parties that collect interest-based information on the Websites do not participate in the Website Opt Out, in which case the best way to avoid third-party tracking of your online behaviors may be through your browser settings and deletion of cookies. The Website Opt Out works only on websites. To opt out of having participating entities track your behaviors for advertising purposes when you using a mobile app, download and use the Digital Advertising Alliance’s “App Choices” app. As with the Website Opt Out, the “Mobile App Opt Out” prevents tracking only by participating entities.
Please note that the Website Opt Out is device specific. If you wish to opt-out from having interest-based information collected by participating entities across all devices, you need take the steps outlined above from each device.
