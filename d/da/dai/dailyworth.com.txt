By using any of the Services, you consent to the collection, use, processing, and sharing of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. Each time you visit the Website or use the services, you agree and expressly consent to our collection, use, and disclosure of the information that you provide as described in this policy.

You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of all Personal Information you submit to HerMoney.
We also collect and store the Personal Information you voluntarily submit to us through registering with us or uploading or posting User Content through the Site or Services. If you are signed into your social media account(s) such as Tumblr, Twitter, pinterest, instagram, linkedin or Facebook account and you “like” or “comment” on HerMoney Content (such as the articles found on our blog) or other User Content, your social media username will be displayed and so available to the public. You agree that your username, likes, feedback, and any associated comments may become public information; we therefore urge you to exercise caution when deciding to disclose any Personal Information on the Site, the App or through the Services.
In addition, if you choose to purchase or subscribe to a feature or Services of HerMoney that requires a Fee, you will be required to provide us with your billing information, including, without limitation, bank account numbers, credit card or debit card numbers, account details, ACH information, and similar data (collectively, “Billing Information”).
Non-Personal Information
Cookies and Other Technologies. We may utilize cookies and other technologies, such as, web beacons (also known as “clear gifs” and “pixel tags”) to recognize you, customize your experience, and serve advertisements. Cookies are very small files placed on your computer, and they allow us to count the number of visitors to HerMoney and distinguish repeat visitors from new visitors. They also allow us to save User preferences and track User trends. We may also enable advertisers and ad servers to promote third party products and/or services by placing advertisements on HerMoney. These advertisers and ad servers may use cookies and/or web beacons to monitor information related to served advertisements.
Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better website, by enabling us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us.
This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Policy covers the use of cookies by HerMoney and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. This may prevent you from taking full advantage of the website.
Information Collected Automatically. We automatically receive and collect information such as your IP address, the URLs of websites you arrive at HerMoney from or leave HerMoney to go to, your type of browser and language, access times, the content of any undeleted cookies that your browser previously accepted from us, your operating system, your mobile provider, your mobile device, and your ISP. We may use such information to better understand how HerMoney visitors use the Site and the App, to analyze trends, administer the website, prevent fraud, and gather broad demographic information.
