Privacy Policy - dailymotion
8.6.1.a. General
If you are a California resident, in addition to any other information you may find in this Privacy Policy, this section is intended to provide you with specific information required under the California Consumer Protection Act (“ CCPA ”). In particular, this section describes Dailymotion’s practices regarding the collection, use, disclosure and sale of consumers’ Personal Information (hereafter referred to as “ PI ”) and includes an explanation of your rights regarding your own PI.
Note that rights and obligations provided under the CCPA take effect on 1st January 2020. If you decide to exercise any of such rights your request will be considered as of that date.
The terms “ Personal Information, ” “ Business, ” “ Third Party ” and “ Service Provider ” used in this section have the same meanings as defined in the CCPA.
If you have an account with Dailymotion, we identify you by the email address you use to log-in. However, if you do not have an account, in most cases, we rely on a unique online identifier to identify and recognize you.
When you access our Service, a Dailymotion cookie (i.e. a small text file) is dropped on your device’s browser. This cookie creates a unique online ID specific to the Dailymotion Service and allows us to recognize you when you visit us again (“ Service ID ”). If you use different devices or different Internet browsers to access our Service (and unless you do so as a logged-in user, in which case we might be able to recognize you regardless of the device or browser used), you are assigned a different Service ID for each of your device/ browser combinations. In other words, if you first accessed the Dailymotion Service using Internet Explorer on your laptop, but then visited it on your phone using Chrome you will appear to us as two distinct users. Unless you access the Dailymotion Service as a logged-in user, any information that we might have about you is attached to that Service ID.
Due to legal rules applicable to our activities, the lifespan of our cookies is limited to 13 months. Once the 13-month period comes to an end, the Dailymotion cookie storing your Service ID expires. If you continue to use our Service, a new Dailymotion cookie will be dropped on your browser and a new Service ID will be assigned to you.
As already mentioned in this Privacy Policy, we do not cross-reference Service IDs that are assigned to you on our Service. Unless you are a logged-in user (in which case we may recognize you regardless of the number of Service IDs created for you, and we process your requests in relation to all Personal Data linked to your account), each new Service ID represents to us a new user. For that reason, if you decide to exercise any of your CCPA rights, your decision will only be applied to the Service ID we recognize you under. In particular, if you use the Dailymotion Service on several devices or Internet browsers, your decision to Opt-Out of the sale of your PI needs to be expressed on each such device or browser.
8.6.1.b. Collected Personal Information: Categories, Sources and the Business or Commercial Purposes It is Used for.
We may obtain your PI either from you (directly or indirectly) or from our Service Providers or our affiliates. We receive your PI directly from you when you create an account or otherwise communicate with us or interact with our Service. We collect or generate information about you when you use our Service. Your PI may be shared with and by our affiliates if you use their services.
Note that in order to enable the delivery of ads, certain PI may be disclosed to us by advertising partners wishing to advertise on our Service or by Service Providers we work with in the operation of the Service.
The following categories of PI may be collected by us from or about you and used for the below-listed purposes:

Note that the Dailymotion Service is an advertising-based content hosting platform. Our business purposes include enabling you to use your Dailymotion account, selecting content and ads showed to you on the Dailymotion Service, delivering and monitoring the platform, processing payments that may be due to content editors, using data analytics services aimed at improving our commercial offer and providing required reporting to content editors and advertisers, ensuring security and preventing fraud, providing customer support and ensuring our compliance with legal or industry standard rules.
The PI we collect may be shared with our affiliates, or with (i) advertising partners participating in the delivery of ads on the Dailymotion Service (e.g. advertisers, media agencies), (ii) service providers (data analytics services), and, (iii) if required so by applicable laws, with certain public authorities. When we share your PI, we only do so to the extent needed to achieve our business purposes or to comply with the applicable laws or regulations.
8.6.1.c. Categories of Collected Personal Information that Might Be Disclosed or Sold to Third Parties
The CCPA defines the “ sale ” of PI as any communication of a consumer’s PI by a Business to another Business or a Third Party for monetary or other valuable consideration.
Dailymotion does not engage in data brokerage nor knowingly sells PI of minors under 16 years of age. As part of our regular business activities (i.e. operating an online service offering access to videos and displaying ads), your PI may be disclosed to companies we cooperate with. These companies may use such information to help us conduct our business activities (in doing so, they are our Service Providers), as well as for their own business purposes. If they do use your PI for their own business activities, our disclosure of your PI amounts to its sale.
In addition, our advertising partners collect PI, such as digital identifiers (e.g. online identifiers, IP address), activity history (how you interact with their ads) and electronic information, when you use our Service and are shown their ads. That information is used to deliver, analyze and tailor ads you see on our Service or elsewhere. To tailor ads that may be more relevant to you, we or our commercial partners may share it with Third Parties.
If you do not want us to sell your PI, you may decide to Opt-Out as further explained below in Section 8.6.1.e.
The following categories of PI may be disclosed or sold by us:
Category of PI| Can the PI be Disclosed? If so, for what purpose?| Can the PI be Sold? If so, for what purpose?
---|---|---
Identifiers | Yes, to comply with a legal obligation, to achieve our business purposes| Yes: to tailor, deliver and analyze the delivery of ads and content to you on our Service and on third parties’ services
Commercial Information| Yes, to comply with a legal obligation or to achieve our business purposes| No
Internet or other electronic network activity information| Yes, to achieve our business purposes| Yes: to tailor, deliver and analyze the delivery of ads and content to you on our Service and on third parties’ services
Geolocation data| Yes, to achieve our business purposes| Yes, limited to city-level localization information based on your IP address: to tailor, deliver and analyze the delivery of ads and content to you on our Service and on third parties’ services
Inferences drawn from PI to create your profile| Yes, to achieve our business purposes| Yes: to tailor, deliver and analyze the delivery of ads and content to you on our Service and on third parties’ services
8.6.1.d. California Consumers Rights*
If you are a California resident, you have the right to request access to or deletion of your PI that we have in our records and which were collected or otherwise obtained during the 12-month period preceding your request. You also have the right to instruct us not to sell your PI to Third Parties.
You may exercise any of these rights either directly or through an authorized representative. If you wish to make a request regarding your PI via an authorized agent, you must provide this agent with your written permission, which is to be submitted to Dailymotion together with copies of your and your agent’s official IDs at the time of filing a request. We may ask for additional documents or information if we judge them necessary to verify the agent’s authority to act on your behalf, the extent of the authorizations you have granted and to identify your PI.
Your choice to exercise any of the above-listed rights will not result in any discriminatory treatment.
8.6.1.e. Right to Opt-Out from Sale of Personal Information
You have the right to “ opt-out ” of the sale of your PI, which means that you can tell a business to stop selling your PI and to refrain from selling it in the future. Exercising your Opt-Out right does not affect previously sold PI.
To exercise this right, click on the “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” link available within this Privacy Policy and on our Service. Note that this link may not be visible or functional if you access our Service using a non-California IP address (e.g. while accessing Dailymotion Service from a different state or country or doing so using location-masking technologies such as a proxy or a VPN (Virtual Private Network) software). If you are a California resident and encounter problems in the exercise of your Opt-Out right, such as if you are not physically in California at the time, we invite you to contact us directly using either of the contact methods listed in Section 8.6.1.h.
Upon exercising your right to Opt-Out, we will cease selling your PI, i.e. we will refrain from disclosing it to Third Parties for their own business purposes. We will also communicate your decision to all Third Parties to whom your PI may have previously been sold during the 90-day period preceding your request.
Note that while we will not sell your PI once you exercise your Opt-Out right, we may still disclose such information to our business partners in order for them to help us carry out our own business activities. In these circumstances, our business partners will act as our Service Providers and they will not be allowed to use your PI for any purposes other than those we ask them to.
We remind you that an Opt-Out decision is limited to the device and the browser used. If you use our Service on different devices or via different browsers, your Opt-Out decision needs to be communicated to us separately on each of them and renewed every time the associated Service ID is no longer active.
Additionally, if your Service ID is no longer recognized by our Service (either because the cookie it is stored in has expired or because you or the technology you use (e.g. your Internet browser) has deleted such cookie or prevented its deployment), we will no longer be capable of either recognizing you or acknowledging that you have opted-out from the sale of your PI. We invite you to verify your registered options by accessing your CCPA settings through the “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” link and to renew the Opt-Out procedure if needed.
8.6.1.f. Requests to Opt-In After Opting-Out of the Sale of Your PI
Once you have exercised your right to Opt-Out, it is possible for you to opt back into the sale of your PI. You will be alerted if a transaction requires the sale of your PI in order to complete.
Opting back into the sale of your PI is an easy two-step process: you just have to request to opt-in and you will then be asked to confirm your choice. You may do so by clicking the “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” link or by using any of the other contact methods described in Section 8.6.1.h below.
8.6.1.g. Right to Access and / or Delete Personal Information
In addition to the information provided in Section 8.6.1.b., you have the right to request that Dailymotion provides you with access to the specific pieces and categories of your PI that Dailymotion has collected, disclosed or sold during the 12 months preceding your request. This request can only be made once every 12 months.
Additionally, you have the right to request the deletion of your PI that Dailymotion collected or maintained during the same 12-month period.
Upon receipt of your verifiable request to delete your PI, we will proceed with the deletion of such information unless otherwise authorized or required by law.
8.6.1.h. Methods for Submitting a Verifiable Consumer Request to Access or Delete their Personal Information or to Opt-Out from its Sale
In addition to exercising your Opt-Out right via the “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” link available in the present Policy and on our Service, you may submit your Opt-Out, access or deletion request by contacting our Support Policy Team using one of the following methods:
making a request via the “ Personal Data ” dedicated section available on the Dailymotion Help Center;
sending an email to feedback@dailymotion.com
At a minimum, the following information must be provided with your request:
your account login (email address or username used to log-in to your Dailymotion account) or your Service ID(s), which you will be able to retrieve by following the instructions that we will provide to you;
the nature of your request;
documents evidencing that you are a California resident;
an email or a physical address we may use for further correspondence in relation to your request;
whether your request concerns yourself or a third party (if you file on behalf of a third party, you must submit documents evidencing your legal authority to do so (e.g. a signed document from the person you file the request for specifying the content of the request you are authorized to file, together with a copy of that person’s and your own official IDs)).
Depending on the content and circumstances of your request, you may need to follow additional procedures (e.g. retrieve your Service ID following the instructions provided by our Support Team) or provide additional supportive documents as necessary to confirm your identity and identify your PI.
Note that in order to comply with requests to access, delete, or disclose a consumer’s PI, it is mandatory for Dailymotion to first verify such requests. The CCPA rights in relation to your PI can only be exercised by you, meaning that your request cannot concern PI that is not yours and no one else can exercise the CCPA rights in relation to your PI (unless acting as an authorized agent on your behalf). Consequently, we need to take reasonable measures to verify the identity of the person sending us a request, as well as that person’s entitlement to exercise the CCPA rights and to identify the information such request relates to, before we process the request.
The actual verification process may take different forms depending on the circumstances of your request. For example, if you have a Dailymotion account, you may be asked to reply to a verification email sent to you by our Support Team at the email address you use to login. The Dailymotion Support Policy team will guide you through the applicable procedures.
