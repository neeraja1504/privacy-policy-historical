Personal data means all data which may be linked to a specific and real person and which may be utilized to identify this person.
**GDPR  **
DaoPay has taken all precautions to fully comply with the requirements of the GDPR.
Personal data will be stored and processed only insofar as this is necessary for the provision of services. Data is used solely for the purpose of immediate service provision. At no time will this information be disclosed to unauthorized third parties.
DaoPay stores your Data in accordance with the legal obligations to preserve records.
Data collection and protection
DaoPay will process information or personal data on its servers and protect them through physical, electronic and procedural measures, in accordance with applicable law. This helps prevent unauthorized access, maintains data accuracy and ensures that the information is used correctly.
DaoPay will grant only those employees access to such information who require it to perform their work.
DaoPay does not share personal data with any third party without your consent – unless DaoPay is obliged to do so by law or by court order, or if passing on Data is necessary in order to take legal action against fraudulent access to Internet structures. DaoPay does not pass on Data for any other reason, and will only collect, store and process information to be able to offer you better service, and individual information and communication. You are also entitled to be informed of the purpose of the Data storage; for information about the stored Data, simply send an email to privacy(at)daopay.com.
The storage and processing of the personal data transmitted or disclosed to us, takes place only for the following purposes: processing, billing and controlling payment transactions, providing customer support, assuring the best service possible, for statistical evaluations as well as prevention of fraud and abuse.
Any personal data collected as part of a payment process to conduct business transactions is only transmitted by DaoPay to the extent necessary to the parties involved in the online purchase (the online merchant where the purchase was made, and the payment system operator whose payment system was used to make the payment). The legal basis for processing is Article 6 (1b) GDPR.
The downstream payment processing is performed by authorised payment system providers and our contracted business partners (typically banks and credit card or telecommunication companies) that are authorised to carry out the relevant payment process and have in place appropriately secured systems. This is necessary in order to process distance selling payments and to facilitate the use of DaoPay services.
Protecting your privacy is very important to us, and we are always happy to answer any questions you may have via e-mail at privacy(at)daopay.com.
