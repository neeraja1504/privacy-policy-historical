You have certain rights in relation to your personal data. These are set out in the Schedule: Part 4. If you wish to exercise any of your rights, please contact our DPM.
You will not have to pay a fee to exercise any of your rights. However, if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive, we may charge a reasonable fee for this information or refuse to comply with your request.
We may request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity when you contact us. This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who does not have the right to receive it.
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally, it may take us longer than a month to deal with your request if it is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
