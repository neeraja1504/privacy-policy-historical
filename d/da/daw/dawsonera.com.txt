6. Use of Electronic Cookies
What are cookies?
A cookie is a small text file on your computer, created by a website to store information about your visit, such as your preferences. Once a cookie is saved on your computer, only the website that created the cookie can read it. Most major websites use cookies.
Currently, some (but not all) of the Group’s websites use either session cookies and/or persistent cookies – see below which explains the cookies we may use and why.   You will be able to identify where we use persistent cookies on our websites by a pop-up request for your consent on its initial landing page or by the website otherwise notifying you of their use.
Where adopted, session cookies we have used are implementedstrictly in order to allow the services that you request to be provided.  Once you close your browser, session cookies simply terminate.  This is in contrast to persistent cookies (such as our use on certain of our websites of Google Analytics) which are stored on your hard disk, but can be removed by deleting them in your web browser.  We may later choose to adopt additional persistent cookies on our websites insofar as we believe these provide an enhanced experience for our customers or prospective customers.  If we choose to do so, in accordance with the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) (Amendment) Regulations 2011, we will communicate such a change in practice and, to the extent required by the Regulations, we will allow you to give/deny your consent before adopting this practice, to the extent applicable.
Why do we use cookies?
Cookies allow our websites to function fully in order to deliver our products and services to you. They may also help us to improve our website and to deliver a better and more personalised service to you.
Information gathered by cookies will, nevertheless, only be used in accordance with the terms of this privacy notice.
How can you reject cookies?
Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue essential session cookies when you log on to our sites to allow them to function fully. Your consent will be sought for all other types of cookies.
You may refuse to accept all types of cookies by activating the setting on your browser which allows you to refuse the setting of cookies. However, if you select this setting, certain sections within our websites will not be able to function as expected.
Please note that any advertisers on our website may also use cookies on their websites, over which we have no control.
More information about what cookies are, why they are used, and also how you can reject and delete them, is usually found in your browser’s help section. This is normally accessed by pressing the F1 key.

7. Where we store your personal data
Given modern working practices as well as the international reach of the Group, the data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (" EEA "). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers.
By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing.
We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.
