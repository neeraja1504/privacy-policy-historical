Privacy Policy • Damn Interesting
Summary
We hate spam (in the context of unsolicited advertisements, we have no official stance on the potted meat product). We dislike advertising in general, but spam…boy-howdy do we resent its very existence. If you sign up for a user account on damninteresting.com, we’ll send occasional automated emails when absolutely necessary (e.g., to reset a password). Apart from that, we will never send you any unsolicited messages, we’ll only ever email you things you sign up for, and we’ll stop doing that at once if you unsubscribe.
We will never willingly share your personal information with anyone. We have no desire to do so. We’re so averse to intrusive marketing that we don’t even put ads on our own site. We’ll store your email address, username and IP address if you create an account or leave a comment, but we will not share that data with anybody unless forced to do so by law, nor will we use for anything apart from account maintenance. We also track traffic via Google Analytics, but only cumulative statistics and referral data, not for advertising or anything gross like that.
