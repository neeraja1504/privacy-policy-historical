Privacy Policy | Daminion Software | Archive Server for Digital Assets
Introduction
We respect your right to privacy. We will never sell your name to a third party without your express consent.
Because we feel your privacy is so important, we are providing this page to describe when and how we collect and use your information.
Information collection
We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you ("Personal Information") or allows us to contact you. Generally this information is requested when you register for an online service or when you provide information in connection with an online transaction.
When you order, we ask you for your name, e-mail address, shipping and billing addresses, telephone number, and credit card information. When you enter a contest or other promotional event, we may ask for your name, address, telephone number and e-mail address so we can administer the contest and notify winners. We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is also used to help identify you and your time spent at our sites, and to gather broad demographic information. This allows us to see which parts of our sites users are visiting. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means, for instance, that a user's session will be tracked, but the user will remain anonymous. We do not use it for any other puposes. When a user submits personal information, it is kept on a private server not accessible from the Internet. This prevents any malicious use of your information.
Use of personal information
Daminion Software may share non-personal, summary information regarding its customers with partners or other third parties. However, for partners or third parties under contract with Daminion Software, any individual customer information provided shall be used only to perform or complete a necessary transaction or function related to the customer's purchase. These transactions or functions shall be in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy Statement. PicaJet.com will not share any individual customer information outside of the contracted partners and third parties mentioned above, without first receiving the individual's prior written approval. In short, Daminion Software does not sell registrant information to lists. In some cases,Daminion Software may use a visitor's personal information to understand overall patterns for site usage, to contact the user for clarification on inaccurate information, or to follow up on a customer service issue. Personal information may include name, address, telephone number, etc.
Opt-Our policy
When a visitor registers, the visitor will be given the opportunity to select whether or not to be included in the Daminion Software mailing list. Inclusion on the mailing list may entitle the user to receive information or updates about special offers, programs, new products and/or services. Choosing not to register means the user will not be able to receive these benefits or this information.
Online purchase
When you place orders or access your account information, we offer the use of a secure server, which increases the security of each transaction. Our secure server software (SSL) encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. Furthermore, we take steps to protect the customer data we collect from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
Credit card numbers are used only for processing payments the user requests through this service and are not retained for other purposes. When you submit an order on-line, your credit card number is submitted to the credit institution for normal, routine processing. Daminion Software does not collect your personal credit history information and does not share credit or credit card information with other third parties unless compelled by law or a court order to do so.
