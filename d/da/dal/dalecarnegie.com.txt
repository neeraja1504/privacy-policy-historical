This is done by tracking IP addresses and other information such as browser type and version, operating system, and/or platform to analyze trends, help us administer the website, track the movement of visitors, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.
Aggregated demographic information. We may share aggregated demographic data with third parties, but this information is not linked to any personal information that can identify you or any other individual person. Therefore, no personal information is disclosed in this manner.
