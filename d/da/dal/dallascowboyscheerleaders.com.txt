11A. Scope.
Site may collect personal information from users who are under the age of thirteen (13) through their use of the Services. To the extent that this type of personal information is collected, Site does so in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (15 U.S.C. 6501 et seq.).
COPPA requires Site to inform parents and legal guardians about how we collect, use, and disclose personal information from Site users under the age of 13. It also requires that Site obtains parental consent before it allows Children under the age of 13 to use certain features of the Site.  By using the Services, you agree to the terms of this section of Site’s Privacy Policy (individually, the “ Children’s Privacy Policy ”).
This Children’s Privacy Policy incorporates by reference Site’s General Terms of Use Agreement which can be viewed by using the following link: [INSERT URL TO SITE’S TERMS OF USE].
As used in this Children’s Privacy Policy, the following terms have the following meanings:
“ Parent ” includes legal guardians.
“ Child ” or “ Children ” means a user or users that are under the age of 13.
“ Personal Information ” or “ Profile Information ” means individually identifiable information including personal information such as a username, first and last name, birthdate, phone number, email address, and other contact information collected through Child user’s use of the Site’s Services or when Child user registers for an account. Depending on the specific Service accessed, additional information may be collected if the Child user creates a player profile, including but not limited to, height, weight, photograph and/or video and other biographical or personal information, and information about the Child user’s performance or information relating to the Child user’s team, league, or organization.
“ Organization ” means any association of which the Child user is a member or intends to apply for membership by registering online or authorizing to enter the Child user’s information into their website.
For more information about COPPA, use the following link:
11B. Parental Consent.
Site is required by COPPA to use reasonable efforts to ensure that, before it collects any personal information from a Child, the Child user’s parent receives notice of and consents to Site’s information collection and disclosure practices. Parents should know that through use of the Site Services, Child users under the age of 13 may participate in activities that involve the collection or use of personal information. However, Child users may not participate in any Site activities without a parent’s permission.
If a user is under age 13, Site must have “verifiable parental consent” before it collects and uses the Child user’s personal information. Site accomplishes this by requiring parents to provide their name and e-mail address to Site prior to the collection of the Child user’s information, together with an acknowledgement of the fact that their Child is under 13.
11C. Information Site Collects & How Site Collects It.
Site’s General Terms of Use Agreement and this Privacy Policy set forth the information that Site collects from both Children and users who are over the age of 13. This information is collected in the same manner regardless of a user’s age but in the instance of a Child under 13, only with the Parent’s consent.
A Parent has many tools to monitor and supervise the Child’s activities on the Site. For example, Site requires that Parent provides his or her e-mail address as a prerequisite of the Child user’s account creation. Therefore, a Parent can edit his or her Child’s account profile, turn on and off notifications, and monitor all postings to the Site by their Child or other Users using the Service. Site encourages Parents to always closely monitor their Children’s use of the Services.
11D. Tracking Child Users’ Activities on the Site.
When a Child user is logged into his or her account, Site may track the Child’s activities within the Site. For example, Site may track the pages visited, the length of time spent logged in, the information submitted about preferences, and comments posted via the Service. This information is associated with the Child’s account and may be combined with the personally identifiable information Site collects from him or her.
Site may partner with third parties to provide content and/or to display targeted advertisements. Site will not share a Child user’s personally identifiable information with these third parties. However, some of these third parties may use tracking technologies, such as cookies and Web beacons, in order to track user activity. We do not exercise control over or have access to these tracking technologies or the information practices of these parties, which are subject to the privacy policies of these third parties.
Parents may request information from Site on the type of data being collected, view their Child’s information, and, if they choose, prohibit us from making further use of their Child’s information. For more information on how to do this, see the section below entitled “How to Review, Delete or Alter the Information Collected from Child Users.”
11E. How to Review, Delete or Alter the Information Collected from Child Users.
Parents can review their Child’s personal information at any time by accessing their account or profile. Parents may remove access for their Child or delete their Child’s account entirely. Parents can also have their Child’s personal information deleted and refuse to permit further collection of such information by Site.
If Parents wish to view, delete or modify the information that Site collected about their Child, or if Parents want to delete their Child’s account or profile, Parents may do this by directly accessing the Child user’s account or profile, or by e-mailing Provider at DMCAgroup@dallascowboys.net. However, Parents should understand that even after removal, Child users’ content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages, or by other users if they previously copied or stored such content.
11F. Data Security.
Site cares about the security of Child users’ information, and uses commercially reasonable physical, administrative, and technological safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of all information collected through the Site Services. However, no security system is impenetrable and Site cannot guarantee the security of its systems or privacy protection mechanisms. In the event that any information under Site’s control is compromised as a result of a breach of security, Site will take reasonable steps to investigate the situation and where appropriate, notify those users whose information may have been compromised. Site warrants that it will take other steps, in accordance with any applicable laws and regulations in response to such events.
11G. Changes to this Children’s Privacy Policy.
Site reserves the right to amend this Children’s Privacy Policy at any time. Site encourages Parents to check this page periodically for changes. Site will post the date on which this Children’s Privacy Policy were made to alert users that an updated policy is in place.
You may choose to receive promotional emails, newsletters, push notifications, and similar communications from Site. You may opt out of receiving commercial emails from us by clicking on the opt-out or “unsubscribe” link included in the commercial e-mails you receive or by turning off push notifications at the device level. Please note that opt-out requests may take some time to be effective. Your opt-out request will not apply to messages that you request or that are not commercial in nature. For example, Site may contact you concerning any purchases you have made with us, even if you opt out of receiving unsolicited commercial email messages.
California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes
