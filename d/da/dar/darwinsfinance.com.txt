Privacy Policy forwww.darwinsfinance.com
Let me preface this “official” statement by saying, “Yes, I do check out my stats now and then to see what articles are popular, where traffic is coming from and where it’s going on an aggregate basis ” so I can optimize my blog and user experience. However, with thousands of visitors per week and no tangible benefit in doing anything other than that, you can rest assured that I am not tracking you individually, nor would I normally have the motivation to do so, nor am I storing your information in any sort of repository for other sinister purposes.
