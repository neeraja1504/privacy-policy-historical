Your Information Collection and Use Options
You can choose to not provide us with certain personal information. However, if you choose to not provide certain personal information, certain functions of our platform and other member features may not be available to you. You can also control which notifications you receive from DashBurst on the web and through email via your account notifications page and other app or device-level settings. For operational purposes, we may still send you other transactional and administrative email communications without offering you the ability to opt-out.
You can unlink your DashBurst account from other services and close your account at any time where we will then deactivate your account and make your profile and Bursts unavailable. We may, however, retain copies of Bursts previously shared online for legal purposes (like to help prevent fraud and other illegal activity) as well as other purposes. You can still reactivate your account at any time. Also, if information has already been shared with third-party services, the retention will be subject to those third-party policies.
Information Protection and Security
We take protecting your information very seriously and want you to feel confident using our services for personal or business purposes. We employ several security measures to help safeguard your personal information and privacy including encryption, firewalls and restricted access to your data. However we do not promise that your personal information, activity, searches or any other communications will always remain secure. You should always avoid sending or disclosing sensitive information online.
