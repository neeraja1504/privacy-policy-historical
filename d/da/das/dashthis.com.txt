Do you store my passwords?
No. Most data source providers have a secure way of authentication that does not entail providing your credentials. Most of the time, the standardize process oAuth2 (http://oauth.net/2/), is used. We only store a secure token that is given by the API provider when you complete the authorization process. This allows us to fetch data and generate your dashboards without having you to perform an authorization every day.
Other data sources will need an API key. This key is sensitive and must be handle like a password. Finally, in few cases, the data source provider will require a username and password. In such cases, it’s a best practice to create an account for this purpose only and not use your DashThis administrator credentials.
How safe is DashThis?
Internet communications between DashThis and Google Analytics use SSL encrypted HTTPS connections. We know data confidentiality is critical to our clients and their trust in our product is based on our capacity to protect their data. We implement the best security practices in the industry.
What analytics data do you store?
We store aggregate data of your dashboard in our database. This is for performance purposes only as it would take too much time to get the data from data source APIs to rebuild your dashboards every time you consult them.
Most of the time, data from data source providers is read-only; therefore, there is no way we can add, update or delete it. In the other cases, we might request permission to edit account information; however, we do so only to get analytic information. In no way do we edit, update or delete account information.
Data property
It’s your data. You own the data. We do not use it for anything else other to display it in your dashboards. Any stored data will be deleted upon a client’s request.
Who will have access to my data?
You and those to whom you will give access to your dashboards. Dashboards have unique encrypted URLs so that you get fast and safe access without having to log in. This URL is like a password. Be sure to keep it safe.
Our staff might access your data to debug any issues or make minor adjustments to improve performance. DashThis will not reveal your dashboards to anyone under any circumstances.
What happens when I delete a dashboard?
Everything is deleted. Your configuration as well as any data we would have retrieved and stored.
