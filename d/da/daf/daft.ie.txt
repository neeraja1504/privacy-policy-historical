Websites within the Daft Media Group hereafter known as the "Site" provide an online information service. Our service allows advertisers to display properties they are marketing for sale or rent. We are not estate agents. Daft Media Ltd, ("Daft"), has offices in Latin Hall, Golden Lane, Dublin 8. Our Company Registration Number is 347856.
What our Privacy Policy Covers
This Privacy Policy covers any personal information the Site obtains from you when you use our service. This policy does not cover the practices of companies that Daft does not own or control, or the actions of people that Daft does not employ or manage.
Our Privacy Policy may change in the future. We invite you to check back periodically to see if we have made any changes. By using this site, you agree to the terms of our policy.

The following features, by their nature, require and make use of personally identifiable information.

When you use the 'email a friend' feature of this Site we record which properties you have sent to the friend, solely so that we can track the popularity of those properties. We record the other details provided in the email for internal monitoring of the service. We will not add any information collected in this manner to our mailing lists to protect you and the recipient's privacy.
Registering with us
You do not need to register with us to visit our web pages. If you do register with us, we save the details you provide and use them to enable us to personalise the service we offer to you. You can update your details at any time via the site.
Who has access to the information you provide or we collect?

If our business enters into a joint venture with or is sold to or merged with another business entity, your information may be disclosed to our new business partners or owners.

We may also use Intercom as a medium or communications, either through email, or through messages within our product(s). Also as part of their service to us, Intercom collects publicly available contact and social information related to you, such as your email address, gender, company, job title, photos, website URLs, social network handles and physical addresses, so that we can continue to improve our relationship with you.

We also use third party advertisements to support our site. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP, the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing France property adverts to someone in Paris, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).
DoubleClick DART cookies
We also may use DART cookies for ad serving through Google's DoubleClick, which places a cookie on your computer when you are browsing the web and visit a site using DoubleClick advertising (including some Google AdSense advertisements). This cookie is used to serve ads specific to you and your interests ("interest based targeting"). The ads served will be targeted based on your previous browsing history (For example, if you have been viewing sites about visiting Las Vegas, you may see Las Vegas hotel advertisements when viewing a non-related site, such as on a site about hockey). DART uses "non personally identifiable information". It does NOT track personal information about you, such as your name, email address, physical address, telephone number, social security numbers, bank account numbers or credit card numbers. You can opt-out of this ad serving on all sites using this advertising by visiting http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx
Security, storage and transfer of information
We follow strict security procedures to ensure that your personal information is not damaged, destroyed, or disclosed to a third party without your permission (unless they are providing services as outlined in the 'who has access to your information' section above) and to prevent unauthorised access to it. The computers that store the information are kept in a secure facility with restricted physical access and we use secure firewalls and other measures to restrict electronic access. If we are working with third parties we will require them to have in place similar measures to protect your information.
All of the information we collect or record is restricted to our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. We will explicitly ask you when we need information to identify you. We may require you to co-operate with our security checks before we disclose information to you. You can update the personal information that you give us at any time by viewing your details page.
We will retain your information for a reasonable period or for as long as is required by law.
Anti-Spam Policy
This Anti-Spam Policy Notice governs the use of the web page at and its associated services, web pages, domains and sub-domains, which are owned and operated by Daft.

It is an offence to send unsolicited direct marketing text messages or make unsolicited marketing phone calls. Each such call or message may be punished by a fine of up to €5,000.
We consider spamming to be any activity whereby you directly or indirectly transmit email messages to any email address that has not solicited such email and does not consent to such transmission.
