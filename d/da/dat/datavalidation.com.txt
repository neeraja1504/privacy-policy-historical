6. Personal Information
In the course of using the Services, we ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you and administer your account (“Personally Identifiable Information”). This may include, but is not limited to, your name, phone number, credit card or other billing information, email address and postal address.
If you elect to link an email service provider (ESP) account, we may also collect information about that account, including username and password, campaign history, and any other information or credentials necessary to provide the DataValidation Service.
7. Public Information
DataValidation also collects information that is publicly accessible (“Publicly Identifiable Information”). Publicly Identifiable Information (e.g. information available to search engines), may include social network profiles not set to ‘private’ or information on a social networking page visible to users who are not logged in.

To enable this application, we will download the contact information for each user’s contacts and leads, and use this information to determine various optimization scores for each contact.

Security
23. Safeguarding Your Information
We use encryption, access controls, and data security policies to protect your passwords, credit card numbers and email lists.

Your Credit Card Data is protected using controls compliant with Payment Card Industry (or PCI) security standards.
While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect sensitive information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. With this in mind, you must keep access to your account secure and undisclosed. DataValidation does not store plaintext passwords, and cannot see yours. We cannot send a forgotten password, but we will reset it and notify you of the change to your account.
24. Notice of Security Breach
Should an unauthorized intrusion to our system occur which affects you or people on your Email Lists, DataValidation will notify you as soon as reasonably possible, consistent with the legitimate needs of law enforcement or with any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity, security, and confidentiality of the Service and your data.
