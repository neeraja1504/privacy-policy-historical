Information Gathered and Tracked by Progress Software
Product Usage Information Collected Through Telerik Analytics.
In order to help Progress Software improve your experience with the Progress Software products and services, we use Telerik Analytics to monitor and identify trends and usage statistics. Telerik Analytics may collect certain information during a product download, product installation or update, while you are using certain Progress Software products and services. Such information may include, without limitation, how often different features are used, how often different buttons and menu items are clicked, execution time for different operations, error reports, download location, software version, platform information, application/product usage, features usage, exception tracking, OS information, and product logs. The information will be transmitted to and stored by Progress Software on its server, and/or by Progress Software’s service provider(s) on its servers. Progress Software does not use Telerik Analytics to collect any information which personally identifies you.

Organizational and Personal Information You Knowingly Give Us.
Within our Progress Software Websites, you may be asked to give us personal or organizational information in order to purchase or receive information about a product or service. We may collect this information through different methods, including:
Registration Forms. We encourage all visitors to register with Progress Software, although registration is not required, except for access to our premium content areas. The registration forms require users to give us accurate contact information (like name and email address) and references that help us better serve you. Your name and email address may be used to send you information about our company, product updates, special offers, and newsletters. To opt out of receiving communications from Progress Software, please Contact Us.
Order Forms and Enrollment Forms. Our order forms securely collect visitor’s contact information and financial information (like your credit card number and other billing information). Contact information on the order form is used for order fulfillment and may be shared with our Partners or Resellers if that is necessary to fulfill your request. The information that we require in our order form is only used to process your order quickly and accurately. Your contact information will only be used to send you the product that you purchase and your billing information will only be used to bill you for that product. During the purchasing process, you may be given the opportunity to sign up for future e-mailings regarding our products, services, and promotions. If you sign up, we will share your contact information with other Progress Software partner companies only, not with other outside companies.
You may also be given the option of registering a profile with us which would store your name, purchase history, and billing information to make it easier for you to shop and purchase products/services from us in the future. You may opt out of this feature at any time by changing/canceling your profile online.
Progress Software may collect other information, including, but not necessarily limited to:
Contact information, such as name, physical address, telephone number(s), email address, and company. The majority of the information collected under this category is business contact information and when this information is collected in forms on our Progress Software Websites, it is collected and/or transmitted using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.
Transactional information, including information about the products and services you purchase or download or about which you make an inquiry.
User preferences, such as product requirements, areas of industry interest, newsletters, community choices and other information you select in the customer profile when registering on Progress Software Websites or indicated by your use of the Progress Software Websites.
Financial/credit card and payment information. Please see the “How Progress Software Uses and Shares This Information” section for more information.
Event and conference participation information, such as lectures, classes or booths attended or visited during an event or conference hosted or attended by Progress Software.

Other information which may include, but is not limited to, browser and device information, data collected through automated electronic interactions, application usage data, demographic information, geographic or geo-location information, statistical and aggregated information. Statistical or aggregated information does not directly identify a specific person, but it may be derived from personal information. For example, we may aggregate personal information to calculate the percentage of users in a particular zip code.
We may also supplement information you provide with information received from third parties.
Information Gathered through Electronic Protocols.
Statistics and Information Collected as You Browse Progress Software Websites
As you browse our Progress Software Websites, Progress Software’s Web servers collect information about your visit, not about you personally. Via Web server logs, we monitor statistics such as:
How many people visit our Progress Software Websites.
Which pages people visit on our Progress Software Websites.
From which domains our visitors come (e.g., “yahoo.com” or “aol.com”).
Which browsers people use to visit our Progress Software Websites.
While we gather this type of information, none of it is associated with you as an individual. We use these statistics to improve our Progress Software Websites, to monitor their performance, and to make it easier for you and other visitors to use the sites.
Our Progress Software Websites also log Host Names (or IP addresses when the Host Name is not available) for systems administration and security purposes. These logs are monitored and analyzed to maintain systems and information security and allow us to constantly improve the value and the availability of the Web content.
Cookies
A cookie is a small, encrypted data string our server writes to your hard drive that contains your unique User ID. Cookies on the Progress Software Websites may collect a unique identifier, user preferences and profile information and membership information. Progress Software’s server will query your browser to see if there are “cookies” previously set by the Progress Software Websites.
We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies to deliver Web content specific to your interests and to control access to restricted content. Session ID cookies expire when you close your browser. Persistent cookies remain on your hard drive after you leave our Progress Software Websites. The majority are set to expire within 90 – 365 days. We also use cookies to collect general usage and volume statistical information that does not include personally identifiable information.
A cookie cannot be used to access or otherwise compromise the data on your hard drive. While we do not offer an opt-out for cookies, browsers provide you information and control over cookies. You can set your browser to alert you when a cookie is being used, and accept or reject the cookie. You can also set your browser to refuse all cookies or accept only cookies returned to the originating servers. You can generally disable the cookie feature on your browser without affecting your ability to use the site, except in some cases where cookies are used as an essential security feature necessary for transaction completion and might be required to complete certain functions on our Progress Software Websites.
Flash Cookies
We may use flash cookies, also known as “local shared objects”, on our Progress Software Websites that employ Flash technology. Flash cookies are small files similar to browser cookies and are used to remember the site’s settings to personalize the look and feel of the site. Like normal cookies, Flash cookies are represented as small files on your computer.
Embedded URLs
We also use a tracking technique that employs embedded URLs to allow use of the site without cookies. Embedded URLs allow limited information to follow you as you navigate the site, but is not associated with personal information and is not used beyond the session.
Embedded Pixels
On our Progress Software Websites, we may use embedded pixel technologies on selected pages for the purposes of identifying unique user visits to the Progress Software Websites as opposed to aggregate hits. In addition, embedded pixels or other technologies may be used in emails to provide information on when the email was opened to track marketing campaign responsiveness; information collected using these technologies may be associated with the recipient’s email address.
Third Party Cookies
Progress Software has engaged one or more third party service providers to track and analyze usage and volume statistical information from visitors to the Progress Software Websites, as well as to optimize and serve ads based on your past visits to our Progress Software Websites. The service provider(s) set cookies on behalf of Progress Software. One such service provider is Google Analytics. We use Display Advertising and Remarketing with Google Analytics. As a result of these cookies, third party vendors, including Google, will show our ads on sites across the Internet. You may opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising or customize Google Display Network ads by using the Ads Preferences Manager on Google’s website.
Widgets
Our Progress Software Websites include Widgets, which are interactive mini-programs that run on our site to provide specific services from another company (e.g., links to bookmarked sites). Some information, such as your email address, may be collected through the Widget. Cookies may also be set by the Widget to enable it to function properly. Information collected by this Widget is governed by the privacy policy of the company that created it.
