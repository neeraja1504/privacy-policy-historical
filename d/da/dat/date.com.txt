This statement discloses the information gathering process and the privacy and dissemination practices for the Date.com Web site. Date.com has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to protect your personal privacy.
Date.com is an internet singles portal designed to provide an easy way to meet other singles on the internet. Members create a profile and are then paired with a number of other members based on their pre-selected dating criteria. None of the information requested can be used by the public to identify a specific individual. This includes visitors, other members, anyone not employed by Date.com, its corporate affiliates, or the financial institutions we use to process membership fees.
Date.com is a membership-based service that collects credit card numbers, addresses, and bank information only from those who choose to sign up as paid members. Any visitors to Date.com may choose to browse the site, search the profiles and/or view any articles by signing up for a free trial membership.
Date.com's registration form requires users to provide contact information such as an email address and demographic information (such as zip code, age, or income level). Date.com also occasionally runs contests and conducts online surveys that ask visitors for contact information such as name and email address and demographic information such as zip code, age, or income level.
Date.com contains links to other web sites and Date.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such sites.
