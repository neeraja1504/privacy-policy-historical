Information we collect and how we use it
We offer a number of Services that do not require you to register for an account or provide any personal information to us. In order to provide our full range of Services, we may collect the following types of information:
Information you provide  – When you sign up for a DAT Solutions Service or promotion that requires registration, we ask you for personal information (such as your name, email address and an account password). For certain Services, such as our DAT Load Boards and DAT OnBoard™, we also request credit card or other payment account information, as well as Federal Tax ID #, which we maintain in encrypted form on secure servers. We may combine the information you submit under your account with information from other DAT Solutions Services or third parties in order to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our Services.
Cookies  – When you visit DAT Solutions, we send one or more cookies – a small file containing a string of characters – to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. We use cookies to improve the quality of our Service by storing user preferences and tracking user trends, such as how people navigate our websites.
Log information  – When you access DAT Solutions Services, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
User communications  – When you send email or other communications to DAT Solutions, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our Services.
Affiliated sites  – We offer some of our Services in connection with other web sites. Personal information that you provide to those sites may be sent to DAT Solutions in order to deliver the Service. We process such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. The affiliated sites may have different privacy practices and we encourage you to read their privacy policies.
Links  – DAT Solutions may present links in a format that enables us to track whether these links have been followed. We use this information to improve the quality of our customer relationship systems and customized content.
Other sites  – This Privacy Policy applies to DAT Solutions Services only. We do not exercise control over the sites displayed as links from within our various Services. These other sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you.
DAT Solutions processes personal information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. In addition to the above, such purposes include but are not limited to:
Providing our Services to users, including the display of customized content and advertising;
Auditing, research and analysis in order to maintain, protect and improve our Services;
Sending you marketing communications that we believe may be of interest to you in accordance with your preferences;
Ensuring the technical functioning of our network; and
Developing new Services.
We may process personal information to provide our own Services. In some cases, we may process personal information on behalf of and according to the instructions of a third party, such as our business partners.
Choices for personal information
When you sign up for a particular Service that requires registration, we ask you to provide personal information.  We will not collect or use sensitive information for purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy and/or in the supplementary Service privacy notices, unless we have obtained your prior consent.
Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some DAT Solutions features and Services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled. You may decline to submit personal information to any of our Services, in which case DAT Solutions may not be able to provide those Services to you.
Information sharing
DAT Solutions only shares personal information with other companies or individuals outside of DAT Solutions in the following limited circumstances:
We have your consent. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information.
We provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and/or any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of DAT Solutions, its users or the public as required or permitted by law.
If DAT Solutions becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information. This refers to information that is recorded about users and collected into groups so that it no longer reflects or references an individually identifiable user. Examples could include the number of users who clicked on a particular advertisement or the number of users submitting a particular Freight Matching search. Such information does not identify you individually.
Please contact us at the address below for any additional questions about the management or use of personal data.
Information security
We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.
We restrict access to personal information to DAT Solutions employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our Services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.
Data integrity
DAT Solutions processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Privacy Policy or any applicable Service-specific privacy notice. We review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide or improve our Services. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary.
Accessing and updating personal information
When you use DAT Solutions Services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this Service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Some of our Services have different procedures to access, correct or delete users’ personal information.

DAT Solutions regularly reviews its compliance with this Privacy Policy. Please feel free to direct any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy or DAT Solutions’ treatment of personal information by contacting us through this web site or by writing to us at

Changes to this Privacy Policy
Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent, and we expect most such changes will be minor.
