Privacy Policy
In this Privacy Policy, we, Databricks, Inc., describe what types of personal data we collect while you browse our publicly available websites and use our services, how we use it, and what you can expect from us while we hold it.
What does it cover?
This Privacy Policy covers all Databricks-branded publicly available websites, including sites located on databricks.com (other than .cloud.databricks.com and help.databricks.com), as well as spark-summit.org, and spark-packages.org and any other pages that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “Sites”). With the exception of Account Information and Usage Data (each defined below), this Privacy Policy expressly does not cover data submitted through or otherwise collected during the use of the Databricks Platform Services (known as Databricks and Databricks Community Edition, each located at .cloud.databricks.com, or the related website at help.databricks.com and platform support services, together the “Platform Services”), which are subject to the Databricks Terms of Service (or with respect to the Community Edition, the Community Edition Terms of Service) or other written agreement in place between Databricks and our subscribers (“Subscribers”), or any other data collection and processing, including, without limitation, data that we collect offline.
Subscribers are solely responsible for establishing policies for and ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, as well as any and all privacy policies, agreements or other obligations, relating to the such Subscribers’ use of personal data or collection of personal data in connection with the use of our Platform Services by individuals with whom our Subscribers interact. If you are an individual who interacts with a Subscriber using our Platform Services or you otherwise believe that a Subscriber uses our Platform Services to process your personal data, and you contact us regarding this data, then you will be directed to contact our Subscriber for assistance with any requests or questions relating to your personal data, including without limitation any requests to access, amend or erase your personal data.
What information do we collect?
We collect information and data from you in two ways. First, we collect information you manually provide to us, including registration info like your name and email address. Second, we collect information automatically from your use of our Sites and Platform Services, including how and when our Sites and Platform Services are used.

You will know which data categories you provide to us, because you will affirmatively enter and submit the data. Any such information you provide us in connection with the registration for our Platform Services is deemed “Account Information.” Databricks may receive information from third parties regarding the companies and users who use our Sites and Platform Services and may combine such information with the information we receive or collect from you.

Information we collect about your use of our Platform Services.
When you use our Platform Services, a lot of information and data gets automatically generated and collected that can help us to understand how you are using our Platform Services, and how to better provide the Platform Services to you.
When you use the Platform Services, we automatically record information about how our users (both account holders and other users on a user account) (“Users”) use the Platform Services (known as “Usage Data”). Most Usage Data is not personal data, and includes information like browser type, operating system, the pages or features of our Platform Services accessed or used by User and the time spent on those pages or features, search terms entered into our Platform Services to browse the docs, commands executed when using our Platform Services, information about the types and size of files analyzed via the Platform Services, and other statistical information. Some Usage Data may include certain information which may be considered personal data depending on where you live, like a User’s Internet Protocol (IP) address.

What rights do you have over your information?
We offer you choices regarding the collection, use and sharing of your personal data and we will respect the choices you make. Where you have consented to Databricks’ processing of your personal data, you may withdraw that consent at any time by contacting privacy@databricks.com with the subject “Withdraw Consent”.

Opt Out of Certain Communications.

We may need to send you certain communications regarding products or services you are using and you may not be able to opt out of those communications – e.g., communications regarding updates to the terms governing your access to or use of our Sites or this Privacy Policy or information about billing.
Rights of Access, Modification, Deletion and Restriction of Your Information.
Individuals located in certain countries, including the European Economic Area, have certain statutory rights (including under Privacy Shield) in relation to their personal data.

and you are an individual user of our Community Edition services, please contact us at ce-dsr@databricks.com with your request with the subject “Community Edition Data Subject Request”;
and you are an individual user through a Subscriber account, please route your request through the appropriate Subscriber and ask that the administrator of the account send us an email at dsr@databricks.com with the subject “Data Subject Request”. Please note that we cannot process your request directly, as your information is controlled by that Subscriber, and we do not directly have a relationship with you; or
and you believe we have your personal data for some other reason, including if you registered for one of our events, etc., please contact us at privacy@databricks.com with your request with the subject “Other Personal Data Request” and please provide as much information as you can regarding you request so we can properly resolve it.
We will endeavor to promptly respond to your request. Although Databricks makes good faith efforts to provide users of our Sites and Platform Services with access to their personal data, there may circumstances in which Databricks is unable to provide access including but not limited to: where the information contains legal privilege, would compromise others’ privacy or other legitimate rights, where the burden or expense of providing would be disproportionate to the risks to of the User’s privacy in the case in question, where the request is manifestly unfounded or excessive or where it is commercially proprietary. If you request deletion of your personal data, please note that we may continue to retain certain of your personal data in archived/backup copies for our records or as otherwise required or allowed by law.

Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of any information.
