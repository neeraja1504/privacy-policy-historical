User Data Supplementation
We may receive information about you from other sources, including publicly available databases, other Users, third parties from whom we have purchased data or through the Browser Extension, and combine this data with information we already have about you. This helps us to update, expand and analyze our records, identify new customers, and provide products and services that may be of interest to you. If you provide us with personal information about others, or if others give us your information, we will only use that information for the specific reason for which it was provided to us.   We may, however, make this information available to other Users.  We will only do so if you certify that the third parties about whom you are providing us with personal information are not citizens or residents of any country in the European Economic Area.

We may combine this with information that we already have collected about you. Such collected data could include contact details (such as email address) and interests.
In such instances as these, where Datanyze as a Data Controller does not obtain personal information directly from you (“Data Subject”), Datanyze will provide you, the Data Subject, with the following details, either through this policy, in addition to it, or separately from it: our identity and the contact details as the Data Controller; the purpose of the processing for which the personal information are intended as well as the legal basis for the processing; the categories of persons concerned; the recipients or categories of recipients of the personal information, where applicable; where applicable, whether Datanyze intends to transfer personal information to a recipients in a third country or international organization.
In addition to the information referred to above, Datanyze, as the controller, may provide you, the Data Subject, with the following information necessary to ensure fair and transparent data processing, as applicable: the period for which the personal information will be stored, or if that is not possible, the criteria used to determine that period; if applicable, the legitimate interests pursued by Datanyze in processing the data; the existence of your data subject rights to request from Datanyze access to and rectification or erasure of personal information or restriction of processing concerning the data, as well as the right to a portable copy of your data; the existence of your right to withdraw consent at any time; the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority; from which source(s) the personal information originated, and if applicable, whether it came from publicly accessible sources; the existence of any automated decision-making, including profiling, and information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing for you as the data subject.

Collection of Data for Business Contact Database
We collect and organize data about employees from Users and make this data available for end users’ internal business purposes (the “Business Contact Database”). The Business Contact Database is identified on the Site, for logged in Users, through the “People” tab. We gather such data through a number of sources, including through the Browser Extension and from third parties.
Users can also provide personal information about their own business contacts, which we may then add to the Business Contact Database.  We will only provide such personal information to the Business Contact Database if the User providing us the information certifies that the person whose personal information is being provided is neither a citizen nor resident of the European Economic Area.
Sometimes Users may provide us with personal information about a business contact, without providing us the contact’s email address.  Our proprietary software will try to determine that contact’s business email address.  We will supplement the contact’s record in the Business Contact Database with this new information.
We take the following steps to ensure the integrity of the Contact Information and Services:
Business Information Only – Datanyze only collects business-related information. Therefore, any contacts that have an address from a consumer-oriented service such as Gmail, Hotmail or Yahoo are disregarded.
Anonymity – We do not publicly disclose who contributed particular Contact Information using the Services.
Opt Out – Anyone added to our databases may request to be removed at any time, via the contact information provided below. We promptly honor such requests.
Please note that because users agree to provide us with Contact Information voluntarily, such information does not constitute “harvested” emails under the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003.
Datanyze collects information under the direction of its Clients, and in some cases, has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal information it processes. If you are a customer of one of our Clients and would no longer like to be contacted by one of our Clients that use our service, please contact the Client that you interact with directly. We may transfer personal information to companies that help us provide our service. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our Clients.
An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct his query to the Datanyze’s Client (the data controller). If requested to remove data we will respond within a reasonable timeframe.
Datanyze will only use the data obtained from you for the Business Contact Database for the purposes set forth in this Privacy Policy.
To the extent you provide Datanyze personal information about Data Subjects other than yourself and authorize such information to be included in the Business Contact Database, you represent and warrant that you have the necessary consent and authority to transfer such information to Datanyze and for Datanyze to use such information for the purposes set forth in this Privacy Policy.  You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Datanyze, its directors, officers, employees, agents, and other representatives for any liabilities, losses, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred as a result of any breach of the foregoing representation and warranty.

How we protect your information
We adopt appropriate data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction of your personal information, username, password, transaction information and data stored on our Site.
Sensitive and private data exchange between the Site and its Users happens over an SSL secured communication channel and is encrypted and protected with digital signatures.
Datanyze employs the additional technical and organizational measures for protecting and safeguarding personal information within its control, including using established minimum security measures that are taken for protecting the confidentiality and security of data held. Datanyze extends such standards to any sub-processors it uses to process personal information. Controls in place to protect personal information include, for example: physical access controls to Datanyze’s data; logical access controls to ensure only appropriate access to company systems and data from authorized individuals; transfer controls used to protect data during electronic transmission; availability controls to ensure data stored is protected against loss or destruction.
Datanyze uses contracts and Data Processing Agreements with third parties to describe the technical and organizational measures taken by Datanyze to protect and safeguard personal information, including the minimum security measures that are taken for protecting the confidentiality and security of data held, and that Datanyze extends such standards to any sub-processors it uses. In the event of a conflict between this privacy notice and the terms of any Data Processing agreement(s) between a third party and Datanyze, the terms of those agreements will prevail.
You are also responsible for helping to protect the security of your personal information. For instance, never give out your password, and safeguard your user name, password and personal credentials when you are using the Site, so that other people will not have access to your personal information. Furthermore, you are responsible for maintaining the security of any personal computing device on which you utilize the Site.
