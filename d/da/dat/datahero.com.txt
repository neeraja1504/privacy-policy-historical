DataHero Privacy Policy
Effective Date: May 22, 2018
Your privacy is important to us and we are committed to protecting your personal data.
We want you to feel confident when using the DataHero service and comfortable with how your content is used.
We are committed to being transparent about the information we collect, how we use it, and how you can control the collection, correction and/or deletion of the information.
We believe that you should have control over the content you upload to the DataHero Service. We will never share your content without your permission (unless required by law) and will provide you with a clear means to be able to delete your content from our systems.
We believe that you own and will always own all content you upload to the DataHero Service. We will never claim ownership rights to any of your content and only ask you to grant us license rights necessary for us to provide the service.
We believe that having access to your content is a privilege. If you provide DataHero with credentials for a third-party service, we pledge to only use those credentials to list the content that you have available in that service and that we will not upload anything into DataHero without your permission.
By using this service, you agree to allow us to collect and process information as described below. If you have any questions or believe that content has been uploaded into DataHero that shouldn’t have been, please contact us at privacy@datahero.com.
