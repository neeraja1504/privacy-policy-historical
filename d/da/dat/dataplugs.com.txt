What are Cookies?
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s computer tied to information about the user. We may use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For session ID cookies, once you close your browser or log out, the cookie terminates and is erased. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on your computer’s hard drive for an extended period of time. Your browser’s help file contains information and instructions for removing persistent cookies. Session ID cookies may be used by Dataplugs to track user preferences while the user is using our Services. They also help to minimize load times and save on server processing. Persistent cookies may be used by Dataplugs to store whether, for example, you want your password remembered or not, and other information. Cookies used on Dataplugs websites do not contain personally identifiable information.
What is Log Files?
Like most standard websites, we use log files. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. However, none of the information stored in our log files, including but not limited to IP addresses, is linked to personally identifiable information.
How we use the information we collect?
Dataplugs may from time to time engage third parties, including but not limited to, its own subsidiaries, affiliate companies, and business partners to preserve, analyze, store or manipulate information collected from Users on behalf of Dataplugs in connection with delivering Dataplugs services. In all such cases, such third party service providers or business partners will be required to treat all such information collected from Users, including Users personally identifiable data, with the same degree of care as Dataplugs and they will be prohibited from disclosing such data to any other person or party, except as otherwise provided for in this Privacy Policy.
