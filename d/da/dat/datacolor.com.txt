Privacy Policy | Datacolor
General:
Datacolor AG Europe, Grundstrasse 12, 6343 Rotkreuz, Switzerland and its subsidiaries and affiliates (individually or collectively, “Datacolor” or “we/our/us”) as the owners and operators of these websites take the protection of personal data very seriously. For data collection, data processing and data usage, we proceed according to the applicable data protection law, as the case may be the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR), the Swiss Federal Data Protection Act as of 19 June 1992 or other data protection regulation applicable to the specific processing. Find out what information and data we collect, how we use it and with whom we may share it when you visit and/or use any website(s), mobile site(s) and/or app(s) provided by us (individually or collectively, “Website(s)”).
Datacolor shares the personal data collected in the context of product and service information within the group. Please find here a list of Datacolor entities worldwide. Furthermore, Datacolor may share information required for the performance of a contract within its Group worldwide. This may cause data collected to be disclosed or transferred to DATACOLOR employees in countries deemed to have no adequate data protection legislation in the view of the EU and/or Switzerland. In cases this takes place, Datacolor however has implemented adequate guarantees to ensure adequate protection of the personal data. You may request more information in this respect by sending an email to websitegovernancedontlike@spamdatacolorcom.spam.
If you visit our Website(s) without giving any information about your person and do not contact us, we save various data like IP address, browser settings (such as browser version, language settings).

Data you entered on our Website(s) is used for the purpose for which you have given this information. Datacolor use your personal information primarily to answer your requests, to process your orders, to deliver goods and process payments. For this purpose, it may be necessary to disclose your personal data to third-party companies, which we use to execute and process our commitments. A transfer of your personal data could therefore be necessary, e.g. to the shipping company we authorized to deliver the goods from your order, for the settlement of payments your payment details will be transferred to the company responsible for processing payments related to your order. We provide these companies only with the information they need to perform their services. Furthermore, we require that these third-party companies agree to keep all information shared with them confidential and to use the information only to perform their obligations to us. With the complete fulfilment of the contract and the full payment your data will be locked. After the retention requirements of local tax and commercial law we will delete your data unless further use of the data has been permitted by law or with your given permission.
In addition, Datacolor will collect, store, modify, transmit or use personal data to perform its own business purposes if:
this is necessary for the establishment, implementation or termination of a legal transaction or obligation
this is necessary due to legal obligations, official or judicial orders

If not indicated otherwise, personal data is stored until the purpose is reached. Datacolor may have an obligation to retain data for financial, tax and other legal reasons. Datacolor uses the forgoing data to optimize your and other customers ordering process. In addition, Datacolor uses this data to provide you with personalized product recommendations via email. In addition, we use your personal data in compliance with the legal requirements for the purposes of advertising, market research, customized offers like products, promotional offers and services that you might be interested in.

Cookies:
To optimize our web presence, we use cookies. These are small text files stored in your computer. In general, these cookies are deleted after you close the browser. Some cookies remain on your computer (long-term cookies) and permit its recognition on your next visit. This allows us to improve your access to our site.
You can prevent storage of cookies by choosing a “disable cookies” option in your browser settings. But this can limit the functionality of our Website(s).
Clear gif files (Web Beacons):
Our service sometimes uses a software technology known as clear gif files (i.e. web beacons) to help us improve managing the contents and user interaction by telling us which contents are effective. Clear gif files are tiny graphics with a unique label that work in a similar way to cookies and are used to monitor the user’s online activities. In contrast to cookies that are saved on a user’s computer hard disk, clear gif files are embedded invisibly in websites and are about as big as the full stop at the end of this sentence. Where appropriate, we combine the information collected by the clear gif files with the personal information of our customers.
Server-Log Files:
The Internet provider of this Website(s) automatically stores information that your browser submits to the server in – so called – server-log files. These information includes:

Furthermore, Facebook makes your likes public for your Facebook friends. If you are logged into Facebook, it can assign the invocation of our page directly to your Facebook account. Even if you are not logged in or don’t have a Facebook account, your browser sends information (e.g. which web pages you have called up, your IP address) which is then stored by Facebook.

Integration of other third-party services and content:
It is possible for third-party contents, such as videos on YouTube, Marketo, GoToMeeting, Amazon Web Services or contents from other websites are integrated in this Website(s). This always presumes that the providers of such content (referred to hereinafter as “third-party providers”) can see the IP address of the users. Without the IP address, they could not send the contents to the respective user’s device. The IP address is therefore necessary in order to show these contents. We endeavor to use only those contents whose respective providers use the IP address merely to supply the contents. However, Datacolor has no influence on whether the third-party providers save the IP address e.g. for statistical purposes.
For the purposes of extended usage, some third-party providers (e.g. GoToMeeting operated by Citrix Inc. and Marketo, Inc) demand the disclosure also of personal data, including the user’s name and e-mail address. Without disclosing such personal data, these external services could not be used at all or only to a limited extent.
You can find more information about the use of personal data by Citrix Inc. (GoToMeeting) on the following website:
