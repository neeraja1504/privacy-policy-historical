E. Newsletter
(1) With your consent you may subscribe to our newsletter in which we inform you about our current offers that may be of interest. The advertised goods and services are mentioned in the declaration of consent.
(2) We use the double opt-in procedure when you register for our newsletter. This means that after your registration we send you an e-mail to the e-mail address you provided in which we ask you for confirmation that you would like to receive the newsletter. If you do not confirm your registration within 24 hours, your information will be blocked and then deleted automatically after one month. We also store your IP addresses and the times of your registration and confirmation. The purpose of this procedure is to verify your registration and to discover any possible misuse of your personal data.
(3) The only mandatory information required to send the newsletter is your e-mail address. Provision of further data shown separately is voluntary and is used to address you personally. After your confirmation we store your e-mail address in order to send a newsletter. The legal basis is Art. 6 (1) s. 1 a GDPR.
(4) You may revoke your consent at any time and unsubscribe from the newsletter. You may revoke your consent by clicking on the link provided in every newsletter or by using the above contact details to send a message.
(5) We draw your attention to the fact that we evaluate your user behaviour when the newsletter is sent. For this evaluation, the e-mails sent contain so-called web beacons or tracking pixels which represent single-pixel image files stored on our website. For these evaluations we link the data mentioned in (3) and the web beacons to your e-mail address and an individual ID.
Links in the newsletter also contain this ID. We use the data obtained in this way to create a user profile to tailor the newsletter to your individual interests. In this process we make a record of when you read our newsletters, which links in them you click on, and then draw conclusions about your personal interests. We link this data with your actions on our website.
You may object to tracking at any time by clicking on the separate link provided in every e-mail or by informing us via any other communication channel. The information will be stored as long as you subscribe to the newsletter. After you unsubscribe, we will only store the data in a statistical and anonymous form.
Furthermore, such tracking is not possible if you have disabled the display of images in the default settings in your e-mail application. In this case the newsletter will not be fully displayed and you may not be able to use all the functions. If you choose to display the images manually, the above-mentioned tracking will take place.
