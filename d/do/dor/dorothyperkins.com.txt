What personal information we collect about you and where we get it from
We collect most information directly from you when you order or buy from us. We get technical details from the devices you use to access our apps and websites and from cookies which tell us what you look at online, where and when. Like most other websites, our technology also lets us know when and how you use our websites, such as when you have added to or abandoned your basket or filled in a form.
The personal information we collect and use will depend on why we need it. We will only collect the personal information we believe we need to use, or which you have agreed we can collect from you or agreed someone else can share with us, such as Unidays to confirm student status.
Sometimes we are given information about you unexpectedly, such as from the police, organisations and agencies trying to prevent threats and fraud, and from the public. [In detail][+]
What we do with your personal information
We need to collect and use lots of information about you so that you can use our websites and apps, shop in our stores, buy things from us and learn about our offers and new arrivals. We also need to use some details to prevent and detect fraud.
We look at and learn from your browsing, shopping and how you respond to our marketing to understand what sort of customer you are and predict what products we have that you may also be interested in. We try to show you adverts and offers we think you will like tailored to you based on stuff like your location, including what we know about you including through our apps, websites and other websites you visit, relying on the extra understanding about you which ad providers and social media platforms have collected with your consent.
Our use of your details will depend on you and what you are doing: browsing or buying, if you are new to us or a registered customer. Use will be different on-line and in-store but we will try to join up details of our relationship with you in store and online in our records, even if you use different devices online. We explain our lawful reasons for use of your personal information in our detail section. You can access this by scrolling to “Additional Details”.
Who we share your personal information with and why
We use suppliers and service providers, such as for delivering orders, or dealing with card checks and payments. These include other group companies and external contractors. We only share the personal details they need to know for their services and we make sure your privacy is respected and protected.
We share personal information with third parties when you have told us that we can share, or them that they can share, or you agree we can share your information, such as when you register to use a ‘Style adviser’ function we offer which is provided by a third party, or with third party ad providers, such as social media platforms or Google, so our adverts are shown to you.  We will share agreed details with third parties like Newday if you choose to use their store card, or Klarna if you choose to use their payment service, for the purpose of enabling the service which you have sought to use.
We will provide personal information about you to the police, fraud prevention and credit reference agencies when we have to by law, or when we deem necessary to prevent fraud.  If we decide to reorganise or sell all or most of our business, your personal information may be transferred to the buyer of the business but we will never sell your personal information to third parties for them to market their products to you.  [In detail][+]
Where we send your personal information outside Europe
Business for us and many suppliers is international so your personal information may, at times, be handled in a location outside Europe. When this occurs, we take care in ensuring the security of your information. In the event you ask us to deliver your order outside of Europe, we need to send limited details outside of Europe to fulfil this request. [In detail][+]
How do we keep your personal information secure
Our people understand how important it is to keep your personal information safe and secure. We take steps  online and in store  to keep our stores and offices, systems and records secure. [In detail][+]
How long we keep your information and why
We will only keep your personal information for a limited period of time. This period will depend on a number of reasons, such whether we still need to deliver to you, or you have an account with us, or we are providing ongoing customer care to you. Sometimes we must also keep your information by law, to deal with a regulator or where required by our insurers. We delete your personal information at your request where possible and we won’t keep it for longer than we should or need to for the provision of a service and for communicating with you. [In detail] [+]
Your rights and how to use them
You have rights to find out about how and why we use your personal information and to control its use. These include rights to access and correct your details, in some cases to ask us to limit or stop our use of them and even to delete them.  Where we use your personal information based on your consent, you have the right to change your mind and you can always unsubscribe from our direct marketing to you, by simply clicking unsubscribe in a marketing email, or in this policy.
Your privacy matters, so we have appointed a Data Protection Officer and have a Data Protection Team to help. You can get in touch with our Customer Care team for help with data protemtion matters at customer.service@dorothyperkins.com. You also have a right to complain to the UK’s privacy regulator should you feel your rights or the law has been compromised.
Other details you should know.
Our privacy policy explains how we at Dorothy Perkins are responsible for using your personal information. If you would like to get in touch, you can write to us at: Customer Care, Burton Business Park, Torre Road, Leeds, LS9 7DN, United Kingdom. You can also email us at customer.service@dorothyperkins.com.
From time to time we will update this policy. We’ll always send you a copy in the event of material change but if minor changes are made, we won’t bombard your mailbox. You can, of course, check back here for updates in the mean time! [In detail][+]
Additional details

Concessions
Where you shop in one of our concessions in another retailer’s store, their systems will check and take and record payment, operate CCTV and security and Wi-Fi. They will provide us with details of your purchases for our records. Unusually, if you are involved in any suspected incident, they may share additional details with us to help us together to prevent and detect crime.
Cookies
So we are clear, cookies are the nickname for tiny text files which some websites pages place on the device you use to access them, to give us encrypted information such as to remember what you have put in your basket when shopping, your preferences, whether you have an account and what cookies you have accepted. They will not collect your name, address and payment card details but send back technical facts.  They also help us to understand and sort out technical errors which sometimes happen online. We need cookies to make our websites and your device able to work well together. Some cookies are our own but we also work with carefully selected third parties to help us and who set their cookies from our website pages and to help us run our websites (these are called third party cookies).  You will not be able to buy from us online and your browsing experience may not be as enjoyable if you block your device from receiving cookies.
We use cookies online to do the job a good sales assistant does in store, noting what you are interested in, seeing if we can help show you where those items are, find more like them and tell you about products which work well with them. We can also tell you about special offers and promotions, just like they would.
Personal information does not include information where your identity has been removed or is unknown (anonymous data).  Some of this information may only be identifiable to you and personal because you are logged in to your account, or because we have collected details of your IP address or the device that you have used to access the website. Where we can, we prefer to show you adverts online which you are more likely to be interested in.
Normally until you buy from us, you are an unnamed user of our website but we want to make you a customer. We work with online advertising partners to do this. They set a cookie from our webpages and this allows them to spot when you use the same device on other websites they publish ads on. They can then make sure you see an ad from us (retargeting). In some cases, the ads you see from us online will be more tailored to you (tailored or behavioural ads). This uses known and observed information about you to try and categorise you and predict what you will want to buy and which offers you will most like (profiling). This will be from our knowledge of you as a customer with us and from your use of our websites but we do not share that detailed information with those advertising partners. In other cases, it will be based on what advertising partners /social media providers know about you from their cookies and use of their websites but we do not receive the detailed information from these websites.
You can get more information about cookies and can change your mind about cookies at any time. if you want more details or to change your mind, see our cookies notice.
What we do with your personal information
We need to collect and use lots of information about you and any devices you use to access our apps or websites for many different reasons but we will only use your personal information when the law allows us to. This will always be for one of these reasons (our lawful basis):
Legal basis
|
When we use this basis
---|---
Contract
|
This is where we need to use your personal information for a contract reason (to comply with a contract with you, or take steps you have requested to start a contract with you).
Legal obligation
|
This is where we must use your personal information to comply with the law, or a binding request like a court order.
Consent
|
This is where we use your personal information with your clear consent, you have a complete free choice to say yes or no, and you can change your mind at any time.
Public interest
|
This is where we need to use your personal information for an official purpose, or for a reason in the public interest for the greater public good, like cooperating voluntarily with an official police investigation.
Vital interests
|
This is where we need to use your personal information in an emergency to protect you (or someone else) from death or serious harm.
Legitimate interests
|
This is where, on balance and being fair to you, we have (or a third party has) another good and lawful business reason for using your personal information and we do not need your consent.
By law we must treat special category or sensitive personal data, such as on health or alleged crimes, with even more care and must have an additional reason for collecting and using this type of personal information. Where special categories of sensitive personal information are involved in addition our use will always be for one of these reasons.
Legal basis
|
When we use this basis
---|---
Legal obligation
|
This is where we must use your personal information to comply with your or our legal rights or obligations related to employment or social protection.
Preventative medicine
|
This is where we need to use your personal information for medical diagnosis or preventative health reasons
Substantial public interest
|
This is where we need to use your personal information in the substantial public interest for the greater public good.
Explicit consent
|
This is where we use your personal information with your very clear and express consent, you have a complete free choice to say yes or no, and you can change your mind at any time.
Legal claims
|
This is where we need to use your personal information to investigate, take advice on bring or defend legal claims.
Vital interests
|
This is where we need to use your personal information in an emergency to protect you (or someone else) from death or serious harm and you are not capable of giving your consent.
We want you to understand why we use the personal information we do and our legal basis for doing so. We explain this here.
Where we can, we will also move from using your information in ‘individual picture’ form about you, to ‘big picture’ form as a member of a group but not as an individual. To do this, we can bunch lots of information on individuals together (aggregation), remove or change details that identify you to make that more difficult or impossible (de-identification, pseudonymisation and anonymization) and change information about people into information about numbers (statistics). This helps us to protect your privacy whilst having the information we need to run our business and comply with our obligations. We can use the details for research, statistical analysis, and reports.

Where we send your personal information outside Europe
Data privacy laws in the UK and across the countries in the European Union, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, (the European Economic Area) are very similar.  We have called this area ‘Europe’ for ease.

the country to which the personal information is to be transferred has been approved by them;
the recipient of the personal information is in the USA and has certified they will comply with the Privacy Shield rules to protect personal information, approved by them;
the recipient of the personal information is legally bound to protect your personal information under binding corporate rules approved by them;
we have made sure that there is a contract to protect your personal data with the recipient, using a template approved by them;
the transfer is needed for another reason approved by them, such as to make an international delivery at your request; or
where you explicitly consent to the transfer
You can ask for a copy of the method approved as privacy safe by the data privacy regulators in Europe from our Customer Care team or Data Protection Team using the contact details in section 8 below.
How do we keep your personal information secure
We take specific steps required by data privacy law to take appropriate care of your personal information, whether online or not. This is to protect it against theft or other loss, being corrupted so we cannot use it properly or at all and to stop people who should not be able to see or use it from doing so.
How long we keep your information and why
We will only keep your personal information for a limited period of time. This will depend on a number of factors, including:
whether you have placed an order with us, or have a registered account with us;
any laws or regulations that we are required to follow;
whether we are dealing with a current request, customer care issue or complaint;
where there is a legal or other type of dispute involving or affecting you;
the type of information that we hold about you; and
whether we are asked by you or a regulatory authority to keep your personal data for a valid reason.
We will keep your personal information during the period that you are a customer with us and then for as long as is necessary in connection with both our and your legal rights and obligations. This may mean that we keep some types of personal information for longer than others. Generally, if you are an inactive customer we will remove your account after 18 months.
Your rights and how to use them
You have rights to understand and control use of your personal information. These rights only apply to your own personal information. For all these rights:
we must be able to verify your identity;
your request must not impact the privacy rights of other people;
Your request must not be excessive, very unreasonable or repeated [too often].
They cannot clash with the provision of a service (for example submitting a right to erasure when we are processing an order from you)
Many rights have limitations and exceptions, for instance, we do not have to provide you with legally privileged advice involving your personal information.

Right to object to our use of your personal information
|
You have the right to object to our use of your personal information.

This general right applies where our use of your personal information is needed based on legitimate interests and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground.
We will then consider your request.

|
If we have explained that we use any computer only decision making to make important decisions affecting you, you have the right to challenge those decisions and have a real person take another look at them to make sure they were right.
|
The second look at the decision by a real person may result in the same decision the computer made.
Right to restrict our use of your personal information
|
You are entitled to limit our use of your personal information for so long as we are considering any request you have made for us to  correct or complete your personal information, or to consider an objection you have made to our use of it based on legitimate interests.
You can also request us to limit our use permanently in some cases.
|
The temporary restriction on our use will end when we have dealt with your request for correction or completion of your personal information or we have made a decision on further use following your objection.
If we agree that we should stop that use of your personal information, or in limited other cases, the limitation will become permanent.
The impact of the restriction is limited to personal information affected by the request/use.
Right to erasure
|
You are entitled to have your personal information deleted or destroyed, such as where your personal information is no longer needed for its intended use.
|
We may not always be able to erase your personal information completely, such as were we still need it to comply with a legal obligation, or to deal with legal claims.

|
Where our processing of your personal information is based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.
