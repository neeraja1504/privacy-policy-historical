Privacy and security
You may browse and access information contained within this website without providing any personal information.
Forms
Where you voluntarily provide personal information (eg, through email feedback, surveys, submissions or registration forms), we will only use that information for the purpose it was collected. We will keep any such information secure and will not disclose it to any third parties.
Information you submit as part of official processes may be subject to an Official Information Act (OIA) request. It could be supplied to a requester, with the redaction of any commercially confidential details, or other details inappropriate for release, as specified in the Act.
Social media
We use a number of social media communities where you may voluntarily submit information. These include some rules to protect privacy. Social media users should make themselves aware of the individual social media sites' terms of service. Read our social media community rules.
Email newsletters
When you subscribe to one of our email newsletters, we collect your name and email address. Once subscribed, your details will be added to a mailing list that is used to distribute e-newsletters.
We sometimes use Campaign Monitor, a dedicated e-newsletter communication tool to easily manage and distribute project news. Campaign Monitor is based in Australia and may use servers based in the United States of America and Europe, and therefore your information may be disclosed or used in such countries. Campaign Monitor will use your information in accordance with its Privacy policy (external site).
We monitor the effectiveness of these newsletters using analytical tools offered by Campaign Monitor that collect the following information:
unique opens – the number and email addresses of subscribers that have opened the email
email client usage – which email account (Gmail, Outlook, Hotmail) was used to open the email
regions – where this email has been opened
bounced – the number of emails that weren't successful due to an inactive address, DNS failure, or if the recipient's mailbox was full
not opened – the number and email addresses of subscribers that didn't open the email
shares – the number of times the newsletter has been shared via email, Facebook or Twitter by subscriber
most popular links – the most clicks on any links directing to other websites or information not contained in the email.
There is no ability to collect information beyond this, or to track the recipient outside of a specific e-newsletter. Once the recipient has closed the newsletter, no further information can be collected.
Online booking
Our online booking system uses an in-memory cookie, which is set to last no longer than 30 minutes. The cookie itself doesn't collect any personal information about you (it is used to hold basic authentication-related information) and the content is encrypted.

If you have indicated acceptance in completing surveys or evaluations on your booking, you may be contacted within the next 18 months.
Your information will not be passed onto third parties unless:
it relates to services booked by you on the Department of Conservation website but supplied by a third party and the third party requires those details.
it is required by Police or Search and Rescue to carry out searches, rescues or in Civil Defence emergencies.
