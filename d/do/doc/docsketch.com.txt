What Information Is Collected, How It Is Used, and When It Is Shared
We collect both Personal Information and Non-Personal Information about you. Here is what information we collect about you, how and why we use it, and under what circumstances your information may be shared with others:
Account Registration. Upon registering for an account, we ask you to provide your full name, email address, and create a password. We collect this information for the purpose of providing you with the Service, servicing your Subscription, identifying you as a user, sending you updates about our Terms of Service, Privacy Policy or other legal notices and marketing offers, or responding to your requests/inquiries.
Your Content. Any information, text, documents, comment you leave for any third party inside any document, graphics, videos, audio files, or other materials uploaded, posted, displayed, shared and otherwise made available by you on or through the Service will be collected and stored by us for the purpose of providing you with the Service or servicing your Subscription. This includes any information you fill out inside any document (for example, when you are asked to fill out and sign an agreement). Your Content is not shared with anyone except those you voluntarily decide to share it with. You are solely responsible for your Content. You assume all risks associated with the use and sharing of your Content, including any reliance on its accuracy, completeness or usefulness by others, or any disclosure of your Content that makes you or any third party personally identifiable.
Submission of Suggestions and Feedback. If you provide us with any suggestions or feedback about the Service (“Suggestions”), you will automatically assign to us all rights to the Suggestions and agree that we shall have the right to use such Suggestions and related information in any manner we deem appropriate. We will treat any Suggestions you provide to us as non-confidential and non-proprietary. You agree that you will not submit to us any information or ideas that you consider to be confidential or proprietary.
Your Financial Data. We may employ third-party service providers and individuals to facilitate the provision of the Service. Such third-party service providers will have access to your Personal Information only to perform specific tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use your Personal Information for any other purpose. One of such third-party service providers that we work with is Stripe (a third party payment processing company). It handles payment operations for us. When you want to pay for your Subscription, you will be asked to provide a valid credit or debit card number, full name, billing address, and telephone number. We collect such pieces of information and forward it to Stripe. Stripe is responsible for processing and storing your financial data. If you wish to know how your financial data is processed and stored, please read Stripe’s privacy policy located at www.stripe.com/us/privacy. On our end, we are only able to see and store your billing address and telephone number that will be used to contact you in case there is a billing issue.
Cookie Identifiers. “ Cookies” are small files created by websites a user visits. They are designed to hold a modest amount of data specific to a particular user and website, and can be accessed either by a web server or such user’s computer. Cookies are a convenient way to carry information from one session on a website to another, or between sessions on related websites, without having to burden a server machine with massive amounts of data storage. Storing the data on the server without using Cookies would also be problematic because it would be difficult to retrieve a particular user's information without requiring a login on each visit to the website. If there is a large amount of information to store, then a Cookie can simply be used as a means to identify a given user so that further related information can be looked up on a server-side database. For example, the first time a user visits a site he/she may choose a username, which is stored in the Cookie, and then provide data such as password, name, address, preferred font size, and so on. This information would all be stored in a database using the username as a key. Subsequently when the site is revisited the server will read the cookie to find the username, and then retrieve all the user's information from the database without making the user to re-enter it.
By using the Service, you agree that we may use session Cookies to enable the Service to keep track of your movement from webpage to webpage so you are not asked to re-sign in or enter the same information you have already provided (during an active browser session). Session Cookies are destroyed when the current browser window is closed. If you refuse the use the Cookies some features of the Service may not work or will be disabled. In order to ensure smooth operation of the Service, you must accept the use of Cookies. You may instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. The Help feature on most browsers provide information on how to accept cookies, disable cookies or to notify you when receiving a new cookie.
Google Analytics and Similar Analytics Tools. Third party services such as Google Analytics and Amplitude help businesses and site owners analyze the traffic to their websites and mobile applications by collecting, monitoring and analyzing Non-Personal Information.
Google Analytics works via a “page tag” or so-called “Google Analytics Tracking Code”, which is a snippet of JavaScript code. A website owner adds this code to every page of a website that he/she would like to track. When a website user visits the website (and Javascript is enabled), the tracking code runs in such user’s browser, collects user’s data, and sends it to a Google data collection server. Google Analytics may collect the following types of Non-Personal Information about how users use a website: date and time of visit, webpages visited, time spent on each webpage, referring web site details (such as the URI a user came through to arrive at this site), type of web browser, type of operating system, Flash version, screen resolution, and screen color processing ability, network location and IP address (IP address may be Personal and Non-Personal Information depending on whether it is anonymized or not). Google Analytics may also be used to such Non-Personal Information as: document downloads, clicks on links leading to external web sites, errors when users fill out forms, clicks on videos, scroll depth, interactions with site-specific widgets. Google’s latest version of Google Analytics (Universal Analytics) can be used to track mobile app activity, telephone conversations, point of sale transactions, and RFID or NFC sensor activity. Google Analytics does not collect any Personal Information from users of a website.
We also share your email address, name and IP address with Amplitude to help us better analyze the traffic of the Service.
By using the Service, you agree that we may use third party services such as Google Analytics and Amplitude to help us analyze the traffic to the Service. To learn more about how Google Analytics collects and processes your Non-Personal Information, please refer to Google’s privacy policy located at https://policies.google.com/privacy.
