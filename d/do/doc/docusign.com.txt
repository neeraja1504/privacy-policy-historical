Cookies and Related Technologies. We may use cookies, which are text files containing small amounts of information that are downloaded on your device (“Cookies”), or related technologies, such as web beacons, local shared objects and tracking pixels to store or collect information. We also allow others to use Cookies within the Services as described below. Cookies can store your preferences, your username, and help tailor advertisements.
Analytics. We use services like Google Analytics and Mixpanel. They use Cookies to gather usage data and help us learn how people use our Services, such as the pages they visit and for how long and the website or page they were on before coming to a DocuSign website.
**Tailored Advertising.  **
Ads for Other Products & Services. Third parties whose products or services are marketed on our Services may place or read from Cookies on your computer or other device to collect information. They do this to (i) tailor and serve advertising based on information like past visits to our Services and other sites; and (ii) report the number of ads served and the responses to those ads;
Ads for our Products and Services. We may also use services, like Google, AdRoll, and Appnexus, to serve tailored ads about our products and Services to you on our Services and elsewhere. We allow these third parties to use and access their own cookies on your computer or other device(s) you use to access our Services. We do not have access to these cookies or related technologies, and this Privacy Policy does not govern the use of those cookies and related technologies.
For choices you have on Cookies and related technologies, please see Section 5 of this Policy. For additional information about cookies and related technologies, please go to our Cookies Notice (https://www.docusign.com/company/cookie-policy).
Information We Collect from Other Sources. We may collect information about you from others, such as:
Third-Party Sources. Examples of third-party sources include marketers, partners, researchers, affiliates (like companies connected to DocuSign), service providers, and others where they are legally allowed to share your information with us. For example, if you register for our Services on another website, the website may provide your information to us.
Other Customers. Other customers may give us your information. For example, if a customer wants you to sign an electronic document in our Services, he or she will give us your email address and name.
Combining Information from Different Sources. We may combine the information we receive from other sources with information we collect from you (or your device) and use it as described in this Privacy Policy.
Information We Collect & Process on Behalf of Customers. When our customers use our Services, we process and store certain information on their behalf as a data processor. For example, in DocuSign Signature when a customer (or the customer’s Authorized Users) uploads contracts or other documents for review or signature, we act as a data processor and process the documents on the customer's behalf and in accordance with their instructions. In those instances, the customer is the data controller and is responsible for most aspects of the processing of the information. If you have any questions or concerns about how information is processed in these cases, including how to exercise your rights as a data subject, we recommend contacting the customer.
2. Use of Information
In general, we collect, use, store, and process your information to provide our Services, to fix and improve them, to develop new Services, and to market our companies and their products and Services. Here are some examples of how we use the information we process:

Lawful Basis for Processing Your Information. If European data protection law applies and DocuSign acts as a controller, our lawful basis for collecting and using the information described in this Privacy Policy will depend on the information concerned and the specific context in which we collect or use it.
We normally collect or use information from you or others only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the information to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may have a legal obligation to collect or retain personal information or may need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person. For example, when we:
Use information to create and manage an account, we need it in order to provide relevant Services.
Gather and record data associated with use of a digital certificate or digital signature, it is to comply with regulations.
Use names and email addresses for email marketing purposes, we do so with your consent (which you can withdraw at any time).
