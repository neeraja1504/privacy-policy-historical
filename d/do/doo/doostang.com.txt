Use of Personal Information.
Information that we collect is used for four main purposes. First, we collect information to improve the Site by determining which of our features, services, applications and/or programs are most popular. Second, we collect information to personalize the experience of the users of the Site. For example, users of some of the features of the Site are required to create an Account, UserID and password in order to access those features. Third, we collect information to enable our users to participate in features, services, applications, programs and/or other activities from time to time. Finally, we collect information (such as credit card information) to enable our users to purchase our products directly through the Site.
Technical Information
Every computer connected to the internet is given a domain name and a set of numbers that serve as that computer's "internet Protocol", or IP, address. When a user requests a web page from the Site, our web servers automatically recognize that user's domain name and IP address. The domain name and IP address reveal nothing personal about the user other than the IP address from which the user has accessed the Site. We may collect IP address for diagnostics, and we may collect aggregated demographic/geographic statistics, but your personal IP information will never be shared with third parties (except as part of the sale or acquisition of Doostang).
From time to time, we and/or our affiliates or advertisers may send a "cookie" to your computer. A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your internet browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. A cookie, by itself, cannot read data from your hard disk or read cookie files created by other websites. A cookie, by itself, does not damage your system. We may use cookies to identify and keep track of those areas of the Site that you have visited in the past in order to enhance your next visit to the Site, to streamline site usage, and for some statistical purposes. Our advertisers may also use cookies to ascertain how many times that you have seen an advertisement. We and our advertisers may use this information to better personalize the content, banners and promotions that you see on the Site. You can choose whether or not to accept cookies by changing the settings of your internet browser. If you choose not to accept cookies, your experience on the Site may be diminished and some features may not be available or may not work as intended.
In addition to the other times or occasions on which we might disclose information about users of the Site, we might also disclose information when required by law or in the good-faith belief that such disclosure is necessary to: (a) comply with a legal process; (b) enforce this Privacy Policy; (c) respond to claims that any materials, documents, images, graphics, logos, designs, audio, video and any other information provided from or on the Site violates the rights of third parties; and/or (d) protect the rights, property or personal safety of Doostang, its partners or users or the public.

We may also link to websites that feature Doostang trademarks and names along with trademarks and names of other companies. You should review the privacy policy on those websites, as those websites may not be under Doostang's control.
Security Measures.

[CONFIRM.] Accordingly, your UserID, password, Account information and credit card information are encrypted using an SSL connection and are not expected to be read in an intelligible form as they travel to the Site.
