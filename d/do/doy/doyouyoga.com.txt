What Does Skyrocket Do With The Information Collected on DOYOUYOGA?

Providing our products and services to users, including the display of customized content and advertising;
Sharing information to our business partners who perform core services (such as hosting, billing, data storage, security, and reporting services) related to the operation of the Website and Service;
Collecting and processing information about your actual location to provide location aware products and services and other content;
Verifying your identity;
Following up with transactions initiated on the Website;
Auditing, research and analysis in order to maintain, protect and improve our services;

Skyrocket processes personal information on its servers around the world. In some cases, we process personal information on a server outside your own country. We provide personal and non-personal information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted third parties or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such personal information based on our instructions and in compliance with the appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
We may also disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (1) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Skyrocket or its parent company, subsidiaries, or affiliates, (2) protect and defend the rights or property of Skyrocket or the users of the Website, or (3) act under exigent circumstances to protect the safety of the public or users of the Website.
Choices for personal information – When you sign up for the Service, we ask you to provide personal information. If we use this information in a manner different than those described in this Policy and/or in the specific service notices, then we will ask for your consent prior to such use.
If we propose to use personal information for any purposes other than those described in this Policy and/or in the specific service notices, and you decline, Skyrocket may not be able to provide its Service to you.
Maintenance of personal information – You can access your information contained in the DOYOUYOGA database by following instructions on our Data Protection & Security page. If you believe any of your information is incorrect or needs updating, please let us know at the email address help@doyouyoga.com. Skyrocket will use reasonable efforts to correct your information and our records upon verification of the requested change. If you no longer wish to receive email notifications from DOYOUYOGA, please let us know by contacting us. In the text of your email or letter specify which notifications you no longer wish to receive and provide your exact name, email address and/or address so that we can do our best to ensure that you stop receiving the notifications that you no longer wish to receive. After such a request is received, Skyrocket will use reasonable efforts to refrain from including you when sending such notifications to DOYOUYOGA visitors/users/customers.
We maintain procedures for you to review the information that we collect about you. Find out more on our Data Protection & Security page.
Information Security – We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.
We restrict access to personal information to Skyrocket employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.
However, please note that no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so while Skyrocket strives to protect your information, Skyrocket cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you voluntarily give to the DOYOUYOGA platform.
Accessing and updating personal information – When you use the Services, we provide you with access to your personal information and we allow you to either correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. You can do so via our Data Protection & Security page. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort.
Website Areas Beyond Skyrocket’s Control
Third party links, co-brand relationships and public forums – In an attempt to provide increased value to our visitors, Skyrocket may choose various third party websites to link to, link from, and frame within, the Website. Skyrocket also may participate in co-branding and other relationships to offer e-commerce and other services and features to its users. However, even if the third party is affiliated with Skyrocket, we have no control over these linked sites, each of who have separate privacy and data collection practices independent of Skyrocket. We have no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or actions, and are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any such web sites. Please make sure you are comfortable with the privacy practices of every site you visit before providing the site with your personal information. These linked sites are only for your convenience and you therefore access them at your own risk.
We also may make chat rooms, forums and message boards available to you on the Website. Please remember that we cannot control the information that is shared by members and that anything you voluntarily provide in any public area of the Internet will be publicly available to other visitors on that web site and potentially to other third parties. Thus, please note that you should always exercise caution when deciding to publicly disclose any of your personal information in these and similar areas.

We will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that cannot be resolved between Skyrocket and an individual.
