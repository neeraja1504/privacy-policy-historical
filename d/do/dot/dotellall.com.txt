DoTellAll.com | Privacy Policy
Do Tell All ("Do Tell All," "we," "us" or "our") understands the importance of maintaining your privacy, and we therefore strive to provide our services with your protection in mind.
This Privacy Policy applies to your use of Do Tell All's service (the "Service") that provides users, who submit search queries in a Do Tell All or third-party branded search box on a Web page (a "Search Page"), with Internet navigation assistance web pages containing relevant local search results and other content ("Results Pages;" and, together with any Search Pages, the "Do Tell All Web Pages").
1. INFORMATION COLLECTED
We do not collect any personally identifiable information about you (such as your name, physical address, email address, or telephone number) when you use our Service. Please note that Do Tell All maintains any search query information collected by us on an aggregated basis for the purposes of generating statistics regarding the use of our Service. This data is never used in a manner that matches specific search query information with the identity of any particular end-user.
During the account creation process, you will be required to provide certain personal information such as your e-mail address. We may also request other information such as your zip code, age range, gender, and whether you want to receive promotional information from Do Tell All. This information allows us to better respond to customer support needs and service requests. If you have an online account with us, you have the ability to review and update your personal information online by clicking on a "My Account" link (or similar link) and logging into your account
2. COOKIES AND WEB BEACONS
Similar to most websites, Do Tell All uses cookies and/or web beacons to gather general information and track user visits to our websites. A "cookie" is a small file containing your preferences that is sent to your browser and sent back by your browser each time your browser accesses our servers. Cookies enable us to compile data about site interaction and traffic, which we can use to provide better site tools. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some aspects of the Do Tell All Service may not function properly without cookies.
Most, if not all, of the advertisements appearing on Do Tell All are delivered to you by one of our Web advertising partners ("Ad Serving Partners"). In the course of delivering such advertisements, our Ad Serving Partners may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. Information such as your search terms or the number of times you have viewed an advertisement (but not your name, address, or other personal information), is used to deliver advertisements to you. Our Ad Serving Partners are not authorized to collect any personally identifiable information about you.
3. HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE GATHER
Information collected is used to operate, develop, and improve our products and services.
The information collected from end-users allows us to deliver search results pages that are as responsive as possible to an individual end-user's particular search query (for example, serving results in the end-user's native language and tailored to the end-user's country of connectivity). We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to, or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of, data. When users submit a search query on our Service, IP addresses and search terms or phrases are transmitted to certain Partners with whom Do Tell All has subcontracted. Those Partners can then deliver responsive Internet search results, advertising, or other services for internal data reporting purposes.
In addition, some of the information we collect is provided, in aggregate form only, to our Partners for purposes of calculating amounts owed to such Partners. Our Partners are obligated by applicable law to protect the privacy of certain types of data; however, we are not responsible for their actions or omissions, including the manner in which they use information that they receive from us. We reserve the right to share aggregated information with others. Examples of this include the number of users who searched for "used cars" or how many users clicked on a particular advertisement. If in the future we sell or transfer assets or portions of our business, or if we experience a change in control, reorganization or liquidation, we may transfer such information to our successor or buyer, subject to this Privacy Policy.
Finally, we reserve the right to disclose any information about you if it is required by law, necessary to defend our legal rights, or if we in good faith believe it is appropriate to cooperate in investigations of fraud or other illegal activity in which you may be involved (or are reasonably suspected to be involved), even without a subpoena, warrant or court order.
4. NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIRD-PARTY PRACTICES
Certain of our Partners who provide or enable any functionality on the Service may also collect information from you. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of our Partners. In addition, third parties over whom we exercise no control may have developed any web sites that you click to from one of our Results Pages.
Such web sites may send their own cookies to end-users, collect data, or solicit personally identifiable information from you. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites, including such web sites' use of any information collected when our end-users click through to such web sites. Even though such information might not identify you personally, we strongly encourage you to become familiar with the privacy practices of those web sites.
