Dotblu allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the Dotblu Sites. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the Dotblu Sites. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content you see.
Dotblu does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. However, please note that if an advertiser asks Dotblu to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 18-24 who have viewed certain channels of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. The advertiser may also use information regarding your use of the Dotblu Sites, such as the number of times you viewed an ad (but not any personally identifiable information), to determine which ads to deliver to you.
You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks (see links below) for more information on their practices and for instructions on how to opt-out of certain practices. Dotblu's privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites.
Currently, Dotblu has relationships with the following third-party ad servers or ad networks:
Google, inc. - http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html
Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on dotblu.
Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to you based on your visit to dotblu and other sites on the Internet.
You may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy.

Dotblu uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Dotblu and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, Dotblu makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.
If Dotblu learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. Dotblu may post a notice on the Dotblu Sites if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice) you should notify us via email.
Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, Dotblu does not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information or nonpersonally identifiable information on the Dotblu Sites from persons under 13 years of age, and no part of our website is directed to persons under 13. If you are under 13 years of age, then please do not use or access the Dotblu Sites at any time or in any manner. If Dotblu learns that personally identifiable information of persons under 13 years of age has been collected on the Dotblu Sites without verified parental consent, then Dotblu will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.
The Dotblu Sites are hosted in the United States and are intended for and directed to Users in the United States. If you are a User accessing the Dotblu Sites from the European Union, Asia, or any other region with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure that differ from United States laws, please be advised that through your continued use of the Dotblu Sites, which are governed by U.S. law, this Privacy Notice, and our Terms of Use, you are transferring your personal information to the United States and you consent to that transfer.
In the event that Dotblu is acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information we have collected from our Users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors' rights generally, we may not be able to control how your personal information is treated, transferred, or used.
