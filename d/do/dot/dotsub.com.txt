We may collect other limited information about you. This may include information about the type of browser you are using, the Internet Protocol address of your originating Internet Service Provider, and your viewing history. We do not connect this limited information about you with any sensitive information about you that we may have.
Tools We Use

These cookies help us gather non-sensitive information about your use of the Dotsub website that we aggregate with other information to learn more about how our users interact with the Dotsub website. They do not, standing alone, identify you as an individual by name or Dotsub account number. While you can set your browser to refuse to accept cookies, you should understand that some of the Dotsub services may not function properly if your browser refuses to accept cookies.

We reserve the right to send you notices necessary for your account with Dotsub to be maintained.
We will never rent or sell your sensitive personal information to any third party. We treat your sensitive personal information as confidential, and have systems, procedures, and policies in place so that our employees also understand the confidential nature of your sensitive personal information. We will only disclose your sensitive personal information to a third party if compelled to do so by law. Unless the law prohibits us from doing so, we will make a good-faith effort to notify you in advance of any such disclosure.
