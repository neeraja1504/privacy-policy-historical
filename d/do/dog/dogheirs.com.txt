Examples of cookies we use on our Site:

Advertising Cookies. Advertising Cookies are used to serve you with advertisements that may be relevant to you and your interests.
We allow third-party companies, such as Google and Taboola (see “Advertising”), to collect certain anonymous information when you visit our website through cookies.

If you opt-out of receiving targeted ads in this manner, you will continue to receive advertising messages after you opt-out, but they will not be customized to you based on your use of the Websites and/or third party websites.

How We Use Your Information:
We use the information we collect to try to provide a safe, efficient, and customized experience. Here are some of the details on how we do that:
To manage the service. We use the information we collect to provide our services and features to you, to measure and improve those services and features, and to provide you with customer support. We use the information to prevent potentially illegal activities, and to enforce our Terms of Service. For example, we use a variety of technological systems to detect and address anomalous activity and screen content to prevent abuse such as spam. These efforts may on occasion result in a temporary or permanent suspension or termination of some functions for some users.
To contact you. We may contact you with service-related announcements from time to time.
How We Share Information:
DogHeirs is about sharing information with others. We share your information with third parties when we believe the sharing is permitted by you, reasonably necessary to offer our services, or when legally required to do so. For example:
To help improve or promote our service. Sometimes we share aggregated anonymous analytics information with third parties to help improve or promote our service. But we only do so in such a way that no individual user can be identified or linked to any specific action or information.
To provide you with services. We may provide information to service providers that help us bring you the services we offer. For example, we may use third parties to help host our website, send out email updates about DogHeirs, remove repetitive information from our user lists, process payments, or provide search results or links (including sponsored links). These service providers may have access to your personal information for use for a limited time, but when this occurs we implement reasonable contractual and technical protections to limit their use of that information to helping us provide the service.
To respond to legal requests and prevent harm. We may disclose information pursuant to subpoenas, court orders, or other requests (including criminal and civil matters) if we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law. This may include respecting requests from jurisdictions outside of Canada where we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law under the local laws in that jurisdiction, apply to users from that jurisdiction, and are consistent with generally accepted international standards. We may also share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to prevent fraud or other illegal activity, to prevent imminent bodily harm, or to protect ourselves and you from people violating our Terms of Service. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, courts or other government entities.
Transfer in the Event of Sale or Change of Control. If the ownership of all or substantially all of our business changes, we may transfer your information to the new owner so that the service can continue to operate. In such a case, your information would remain subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy.
How You Can View, Change, or Remove Information:
Viewing and editing your profile. You may change or delete your profile information at any time by going to your profile page and clicking “Account Details.” Information will be updated immediately.
Deleting your account. If you want to stop using your account you may delete it. When you delete an account, it is permanently deleted. You should only delete your account if you are certain you never want to reactivate it.
Limitations on removal. Even after you remove information from your profile or delete your account, copies of that information may remain viewable elsewhere to the extent it has been shared with others, or it was copied or stored by other users.
Backup copies. Removed and deleted information may persist in backup copies for up to 90 days, but will not be available to others.
Unsubscribing to Newsletter. If you wish to stop receiving our newsletter you may unsubscribe at any time by clicking on the Unsubscribe link at the bottom of every email.
Note: Upon personal request we can provide users with the personal data export or erasure requests.
