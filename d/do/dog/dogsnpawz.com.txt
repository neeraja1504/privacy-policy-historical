How we use cookies
A cookie is a small file which asks permission to be placed on your computer’s hard drive. Once you agree, the file is added and the cookie helps analyze web traffic or lets you know when you visit a particular site. Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual. The web application can tailor its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your preferences.
We use traffic log cookies to identify which pages are being used. This helps us analyze data about web page traffic and improve our website in order to tailor it to customer needs. We only use this information for statistical analysis purposes and then the data is removed from the system.
Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better website, by enabling us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us.

I use the following cookies on Dogs N Pawz:
Google Analytics (for tracking website traffic and user behavior).  You can read how their cookies work here.
AddThis which is used for social media sharing.
Google Analytics is used to track website performance and user behavior.  It provides information on page views, referral sources, and other valuable information that helps me improve my website.  Google Analytics captures anonymous data about location, age, gender, and interests, but there isn’t any way that I can get that information and specifically identify that it is you.  Google Analytics may also capture your IP address as you look at articles on this website.  User and event data is retained for 26 months.  It is then automatically deleted.
