Privacy Statement
Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.
On some pages, you may enter your email address (to register for a software author/member account or as reviewer of software). We use the email you provide for notification of a response at a message or software you post on the site, for notification of new software, or to get in touch with the software authors. We never use or share the email address provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.
We may use cookies to improve your web browsing experience, for example to avoid you typing your login/email adress at each comment you post, or to keep your color settings. Some outside parties (advertisers like Google, Kontera) use cookies to understand the way a user responds to the ads they deliver. For example, to let them keep track of how many times you view an ad they distribute. Likewise, the cookie can help make sure you do not see the same ad over and over.
Should you have other questions or concerns about these privacy policies, please contact us using contact link at site footer.
