Privacy Policy - Downtown Host
We at Downtown Host Inc. (“Downtown Host”, and sometimes also referred to in this policy as “we”, “us”, or “our”) are committed to maintaining the privacy and security of the Personal Information of all our employees, customers as well as visitors to our website - www.downtownhost.com or our client or support portals at my.downtownhost.com and support.downtownhost.com (collectively, the “Sites”). As a part of that commitment, Downtown Host has implemented this Privacy Policy to apply to the Sites so that you know what information about you we collect, why we collect it, how we use that information, and the choices we offer, including how to access and update information. Your privacy matters to us, so please do take the time to get to know our practices – and if you have any questions, our contact email addresses are provided at the end of this document.
How We Collect Your Personal Information
When you visit our Sites and submit a request to receive information concerning our services you will be asked to provide personal information (such as name, email address, telephone number and mailing address) for the purpose of administering your request and contacting you.
In addition, all customers or visitors to our Sites have the option to register for our newsletter and special offers subscription (referred to in this paragraph as our “Newsletter”) by entering their e-mail address along with their first and last name. Upon completing your Newsletter subscription, You consent to our occasionally informing you about our special hosting offers and company news by way of e-mail to your subscribed email address. If you no longer wish to receive our newsletters or special offers e-mails, you can unsubscribe at any time by using the link ‘unsubscribe’ on the newsletter or special offer e-mail. After receiving the unsubscribe request, we will delete your email address from the distribution list, thus preventing you from receiving any further newsletters or special offer e-mails from us. We use a 3rd party provider called “MailChimp” to store your subscribed email addresses along with your first and last name (if you chose to provide that information during the sign-up). Therefore, by providing your email address and name to us for the purpose of receiving our Newsletter, you automatically agree to all of MailChimp’s legal policies located at https://mailchimp.com/legal/
We request information from you on our order form. To order a service from us, you must provide certain contact (ex. your name and address) and financial (ex. credit card number) information.
