The Dobot Privacy Policy was updated on May 24, 2018.
Dobot is committed to maintaining the trust and confidence of our visitors to our website. In particular, we want you to know that Dobot is not in the business of selling, renting or trading email lists with other companies and businesses for marketing purposes. We may share your information only with partners who adhere to Dobot's commitment to protecting your privacy. This policy explains the what, how, and why of the information we collect when you visit our website, or when you use our Services. It also explains the specific ways we use and disclose that information.
Information Collected
Information We Collect on the Dobot Products and Services
1. User-provided Information. When you use Dobot Products and Services, you may provide us with information about you, including your name, email address, mailing address, mobile phone number, and payment information (if you use Dobot Products and Services to engage in purchases or financial transactions). You may provide us with information in various ways when using Dobot Products and Services. For example, you provide us with information when you register for a Dobot account, use Dobot Products and Services, submit credentials or other information for account verification, upload or share photos or videos on or through Dobot Products and Services, or send us customer service-related requests using Dobot Products and Services or other means of communication.
2. Cookies and Automatically Collected Information. When you use certain Dobot Products and Services, we may send one or more cookies – small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters – to your device. We use session cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. We may use third party cookies as well. For instance, we use Google Analytics to collect and process certain analytics data. Dobot does not process or respond to web browsers’ “do not track” signals or other similar transmissions that indicate a request to disable online tracking of users who use Dobot Products and Services. This automatically collected information may include your IP address or other device address or ID, web browser and/or device type, the web pages or sites that you visit just before or just after you use a Product or Service, the pages or other content you view or otherwise interact with on a Product or Service, and the dates and times that you visit, access, or use Dobot Products and Services. We also may use these technologies to collect information regarding your interaction with email messages, such as whether you opened, clicked on, or forwarded a message. This information is gathered from all users and may be connected with other information about you.
3. Device-Related Information. When you use Dobot Products and Services, you will provide us with information relating to (i) your Dobot Product or Service, your non-Dobot device on which the Dobot Product or Service is used (including computers, phones, or other devices where you install or access Dobot Products and Services), and your photos or videos that you upload using Dobot Products and Services.  This information may include: (a) information about your non-Dobot device (including your device ID, hardware version, and operating system); (b) information about your Dobot device (including the model and serial number of your device); (c) geo location data relating to your non-Dobot device and Dobot device and any photo or video you submitted using Dobot Products and Services; (d) information about any photo or video recorded, including the name of the video file, the length of the video, EXIF data relating to the photo or video, and the photo or video data itself; (e) other technical information, including the IP address used by your non-Dobot device; and (vi) data associated with your Dobot account.
4. Third Party Web Beacons and Third Party Buttons. We may display third-party content on or through Dobot Products and Services, including third-party advertising. We also may enable you to connect your Dobot account to, or otherwise interface with, third-party services, including third-party social networks and communications services. In addition, we may implement third party buttons (such as Facebook “like” or “share” buttons) that may function as web beacons even when you do not interact with the button. Information collected through third-party web beacons and buttons is collected directly by these third parties, not by Dobot. Information collected by a third party in this manner is subject to that third party’s own data collection, use, and disclosure policies. [For further information, please review our Cookie Policy.]
Our websites are not intended for children and we do not knowingly collect data relating to children.
Information from Other Sources: We may obtain information from third parties and sources other than Dobot Products and Services, such as our business partners, contractors, advertisers, and other third parties. Some of the above personal data is collected directly, for example when you set up an online account on our websites, or send an email to our customer services team. Other personal data is collected indirectly, for example, your browsing or shopping activity.
Third party payment customer's information protection
Dobot uses secure server hosted by PayPal and other 3rd party credit card processors that encrypt all the customer's personal information before it is sent to us, including name, address, credit card number, credit card expiration date, etc. Encryption works to prevent any malicious use of your personal information. Your credit card information is only used for online transition.
What is PayPal used for?
PayPal Holdings, Inc. is an American company operating a worldwide online payments system that supports online money transfers and serves as an electronic alternative to traditional paper methods like checks and money orders. The company operates as a payment processor for online vendors, auction sites, and other commercial users, for which it charges a small fee in exchange for benefits such as one-click transactions and password memory.
Google Analytics

We do this to find out things such as the number of visitors to the various parts of the site. This information is only processed in a way which does not identify anyone. We do not make and do not allow Google to make, any attempt to find out the identities of those visiting our website.
Mailing Lists
As part of the registration process for our newsletter, we collect personal information. We use that information for a couple of reasons: to tell you about stuff you’ve asked us to tell you about; to contact you if we need to obtain or provide additional information; to check our records are right and to check every now and then that you’re happy and satisfied. We don't rent or trade email lists with other organizations and businesses.
We use a third-party provider, MailChimp, to deliver our newsletter. We gather statistics around email opening and clicks using industry standard technologies to help us monitor and improve our e-newsletter.
