OUR PRIVACY POLICY
** ** DirectoryOfEzines.com is committed to protecting the privacy of our online visitors.  When you visit our website, you may be providing information to DirectoryOfEzines.com on two different levels:  anonymous statistics collected as you browse the site and personal information you knowingly give us.
DirectoryOfEzines.com would like to assure you that we do not :
collect personal information from you unless you provide it to us, or
provide or sell the names and addresses of our members and site users to outside parties.
DirectoryOfEzines.com does :
safeguard members’ and site users’ information from unauthorized access, and
maintain the confidentiality of member information which you provide to us.
As you browse our site, our web server collects information about your visit, not about you personally.  We monitor statistics such as:
how many people visit our site,
from which domains our visitors come, and
which browsers people use to visit our site.
While we gather this information, none of it is associated with you as an individual. We use these statistics to monitor the performance of our web site and to make it easier for you and other visitors to use.
We collect information from online visitors who ask to be on our newsletter mailing list and/or receive periodic email announcements. All online visitor data collected by DirectoryOfEzines.com is protected against unauthorized access.
Anyone who wishes can choose to be removed from our mailing list at any time.
In addition, online visitors who wish to purchase a membership through our Web site must provide their name, email address, mailing address, phone number, and credit card number and expiration date.  The information collected is used only to process your request quickly and accurately. All credit card transactions occur over a secure connection.  We do not store credit card numbers on our servers and use third party services for payment processing and shopping cart services.  To confirm that your connection is secure, look for the image of a lock or key on the bottom bar of your browser window.  If the lock is closed or the key appears whole, then you are viewing a secure page.  Otherwise, the lock may appear as open or the key appear as broken.
All personal and financial information submitted during the purchase process is encrypted.
We will not sell, trade, or give your personal information to other companies or organizations.
We use Aweber for our email newsletter. Aweber's email privacy policy can be viewed at http://www.aweber.com.
