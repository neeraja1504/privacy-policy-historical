At DoItYourselfRV.com, the privacy of our visitors is extremely important. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of personal information that is received and collected and how it is used.

What does Google Analytics record?

What do we do with Google Analytics data?
The tracking information allows us to better understand the kind of people who visit DoItYourselfRV.com and what content they’re reading.
