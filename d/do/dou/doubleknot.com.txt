Privacy
We realize most organizations, especially those that include youth membership, are very concerned about privacy.  Keeping member information secure, and using it only as our members would want us to, is a top priority. It is Doubleknot's policy that all your information is confidential and owned by your organization.  Doubleknot does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you or your organization with other people or other companies except to fulfill products or services you've requested, comply with law enforcement and to communicate your organization as a subscriber to Doubleknot's services.  Access by you to your information is available through a password and unique user ID.  By default, from  log in to log out, all communication between our server and your browser is encrypted.
Our list of member organizations is accessed from our home page at  www.doubleknot.com.  If you wish to remove your organization from appearing in our list of member organizations you may do so by contacting us with a request to make your organization private.  The request must come from the primary contact listed for the organization and include the organization name.
Use of cookies
When you visit Doubleknot's site we use "cookies" to provide context to your visit. A cookie is a small amount of data that is transferred to your browser by a Web server and can only be read by the server that gave it to you. It cannot be executed as code or deliver viruses.
Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. Cookies are required to use Doubleknot.
While Doubleknot uses cookies to provide context to your visit, and our Web servers automatically log the IP/Internet address of your computer, Doubleknot does not use this information other then to protect against ourselves and our members against fraud and illegal activity.  Doubleknot does use cookies to "remember" the user ID and, if you consent, encrypted password you use to sign on to the site.  We store this information solely to make the sign on process easier.  Other cookies we use are "session only" cookies and are removed then your visit to our site ends.
How We Secure Information
Doubleknot protects information in several ways.
When you send confidential personal information to us on our Web site, such as a credit card information, member name or user ID and password, secure server software which we have licensed encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. The information is scrambled en route and decoded once it reaches our Web site.  By default, when signed on or making a payment, all communication with us is encrypted.  Our secure communication can be verified when clicking on the secure communications seal on our payment screen and at sign on.
We also use encrypted communications to transmit information between us and our service providers.  For example, to process credit card payments we have a secure connection to our payment processor.
For software, secure communications and service providers we only use well known and established companies generally recognized a leader in their field.  For example, we use GeoTrust, Inc. technology for secure communications and Authorize.Net and PayPal for payment processing.
We do not allow the transmission of sensitive information thorough insecure or unencrypted channels like email.
To safeguard the confidentiality of personal information we collect from unauthorized access or disclosure our servers are housed behind a firewall in secure, restricted access facilities and we fully comply with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS). Only authorized representatives of Doubleknot or our facility management companies can physically access our servers.  To secure data from accidental loss, alteration or destruction we back up data on our servers every 15 minutes.
All settlements for online payments taken on behalf of our member organizations are securely transmitted to our bank account via Electronic Funds Transfer.  This account, with Wells Fargo Private Bank,  has specifically been established to house funds from our member organizations.  Withdraws on this account require the approval of two company officers and internal policy requires a documented funds remittance request.
