DOUBLE FINE GAMES
Some games developed by Double Fine may collect anonymous usage information in order to improve performance, game design, and other parts of the gameplay experience. Any usage statistics collected by our games will always be anonymized before they are sent back to Double Fine. They will never contain personally-sensitive information, and they will never be personally identifiable.
Some games may, only when prompted by you, access personal information such as contacts, photographs, or music, to enhance the game experience. This will never occur without your explicit permission. Such functionality is purely opt-in.
What anonymous information is collected?
Double Fine games may collect gameplay data, such as how long a user plays a given game in total or in a single session, how much of a game the player has completed, what equipment the player prefers, which in-app purchases are the most popular, and so on. They may also collect technical data such as hardware specifications, error logs, and crash data.
What do you do with that information?
This information will be anonymized and aggregated for analysis, and used to improve the game experience. It will never be sold to a third party. It may, however, be shared in aggregated and summarized form for use only in educational materials or trade publications. No personal information will ever be used in this way.
What about games that access personal information?
Some Double Fine games might, with your direct permission, access personal data such as contacts, photos, and music, only if directly relevant to the game experience. This information will never be accessed without your explicit request. If a game does not clearly ask for permission, it will never access any such information. This is a purely opt-in process.
