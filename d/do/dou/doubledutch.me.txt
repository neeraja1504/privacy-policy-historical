You control how much information you provide through the Apps. To use our Apps, you must provide an email and username, and you will set a password. If you did not submit this information yourself, we have received this information from the event organizer to invite you to use the Apps and to prepopulate certain fields in the Apps. An App Provider may request additional information about you beyond a user name and email address. It is up to you how much additional personal information you share with us, the event organizer, and the other attendees. When using the Apps you may choose to create social profiles that display your name, job title, company, links to your social profiles (Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn) and activity. In addition to the above, you can fill out an "About Me" text box to provide additional information about yourself, as well as contribute through posts, comments, surveys, messages, poll responses, and any other App-related functions or features that may be available to you. Please do not include personal information in your posts, comments, surveys, messages, or poll responses. If you are an event organizer, you may also provide us with conference agendas, customer lists, exhibitor lists, and other information.
Personal data we collect through your use of our Apps or Website
We collect limited personal data from you through your use of our Apps or Website. The only data we actively collect from you beyond that which you choose to provide are your IP address, browser software, operating system, and the time and date on which you visited the Apps or Website. In addition, we may also track your usage of the Apps for statistical and research purposes by means of cookies.
For what purpose do we use or process your personal data?
We process your personal data for the following purposes:
Providing you with information about the event that you are attending;
Performing our services;
Enabling App features such as "check-ins", surveys/polls, messaging, channels, agenda sessions, exhibitors, recommendations, speakers and locations;
Prepopulating App fields such as conference agendas, attendee lists, speaker lists, exhibitor lists, and location information;
Showing your App contributions on the activity feeds in the event App;
For analytics and market research to perform or improve our services;
Sending emails or push notifications in relation to the event; and,
Processing complaints or customer service inquiries, handling disputes, performing audits and meeting statutory requirements.

We do not share your personal data with third parties, unless we have a good reason to do so.
Event Organizers
We share your information, posts, comments, surveys, messages, and polls with the event organizers or their authorized agents. In accordance with our legal obligations, we have agreed to safeguard the protection of your personal data in agreements with the event organizers. We recommend that you read and review the privacy policy of the event organizer carefully to ensure you are fully aware of all the purposes for which your data is being used by the event organizer or processed by us.
Attendees
Other users of the Apps may be able to see limited information such as your profile and contributions. Apart from the first and last name on your profile, we do not share your personal data with attendees. The only information that is visible to attendees is the information you decide to actively share on your profile or contribute to the Apps.

We may provide personal information to our affiliates (https://policies.google.com/privacy/key-terms#toc-terms-affiliates) or other trusted businesses or persons to process that information for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other applicable confidentiality and security measures. For example, we might use data processors to handle complaints, to resolve customer service inquiries from you or event organizers, to facilitate internal support operations for DoubleDutch, to send newsletters or other event information on our or the event organizer’s behalf, or to share information with third parties in other similar cases if you have provided your consent to such data sharing. We will not sell to any third party the personal information or data that you provide to us.
Payment Processors
We use third-party payment processors to process payments for our registration App Partners. In connection with the processing of such payments, we do not retain any personally identifiable information or any financial information such as credit card numbers. Rather, all such information is provided directly to the third-party processor the App Partner selects, whose use of your personal information is governed by their privacy policy.
Legal Requirements and Law Enforcement
We will share personal information where we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request (https://policies.google.com/privacy/example/legal-process); detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; or protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of DoubleDutch, our users or the public as required or permitted by law.
Other Third Parties
As an extension to this Privacy Policy and if requested by a partner company for transfer of personal data outside the European Economic Area, we may enter into EU Standard Contractual Clauses to comply with our legal obligations.
Corporate Organization
In addition, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar events, we will continue to ensure the confidentiality of any personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Security of your personal information
In accordance with the applicable laws and regulations, we have taken adequate technical and organizational measures to safeguard the security of your personal information. We store the personal information that we process on a secure database that is protected by technical access controls. We periodically review our information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security measures, to guard against unauthorized access to systems.
We restrict access to personal information to employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to process it for us, and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.
Please be advised that while we strive to protect your personally identifiable data, we make no guarantees or assurances about our ability to prevent any such loss, access, or misuse and are not responsible in the event that such loss or misuse occurs.
