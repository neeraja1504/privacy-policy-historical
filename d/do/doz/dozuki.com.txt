You may choose to opt out of having your personal information disclosed to a non-agent third party, or used for a purpose that is materially different from the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized. To exercise this choice, contact the privacy officer listed above.
If we receive personal data subject to our certification under the Privacy Shield and then transfer it to a third-party service provider acting as an agent on our behalf, we have certain liability under the Privacy Shield if both (i) the agent processes the personal data in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield and (ii) we are responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

The independent dispute resolution body designated to address complaints and provide appropriate recourse free of charge to the individual is the panel established by DPAs.
You may also be able to invoke binding arbitration for unresolved complaints, but prior to initiating such arbitration, a resident of a European country participating in the Privacy Shield must first: (1) contact us and afford us the opportunity to resolve the issue; and (2) contact the U.S. Department of Commerce (either directly or through a European Data Protection Authority), affording the Department of Commerce time to attempt to resolve the issue. If you invoke binding arbitration, each party will be responsible for its own attorney’s fees. Please note that, pursuant to the Privacy Shield, the arbitrator may only impose individual-specific, non-monetary, equitable relief necessary to remedy any violation of the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to the resident.

California Business & Professions Code Section 22575(b) (as amended effective January 1, 2014) provides that California residents are entitled to know how a website operator responds to “Do Not Track” (DNT) browser settings. DNT is a feature offered by some browsers which, when enabled, sends a signal to websites to request that your browsing is not tracked, such as by third party ad networks, social networks and analytic companies. We do not currently take actions to respond to DNT signals because a uniform technological standard has not yet been developed. We continue to review new technologies and may adopt a DNT standard once one is created. For information about DNT, visit All About DNT.
