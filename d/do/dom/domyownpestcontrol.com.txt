DoMyOwn's servers use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), an encryption technology that works with browsers such as Netscape Navigator, Microsoft Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, Google Chrome and AOL's browser, so that only DoMyOwn and our credit card processor can read the information required to process your order.
