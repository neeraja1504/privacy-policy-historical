registration/renewal date and expiry date.
The information displayed will be as you have provided it, and includes the name, address, telephone and fax number, and email address of each contact person listed above.
1. Sale/Release of Client Supplied Information:
Register4less will not, under any circumstance give away or sell its customer's personal information to any company, organization, or individual. Information provided by you is used solely to register your domain.
2. Use of Client Supplied Information:
The information you supply will be used solely to register/transfer the domain name you have requested, and to allow you to edit/update your profile as required. The only public access to your domain name information is provided for by whois query (the method you use to see if a domain name is available).
3. SPAM:
Register4less will never send any kind of publicity-oriented messages in electronic form to any of its customers. We will not give away, sell or expose any customer e-mail address under any circumstance.
Additionally, the terms and conditions of our affiliate program prohibit affiliates from such practices. Any affiliate who engages in the use of SPAM to promote their affiliate business is subject to having their affiliate account terminated.
Register4less will provide our clients with a reminder message once their domain name registration period nears expiration.
