Privacy Policy
The Global Name Registry, Limited ("Global Name Registry") has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this Web Site.
Personal information
We use your IP address to help detect and diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Our site's mailing list form requires users to give us contact information (their name and email address). We may use customer contact information from the mailing list form to send the user information about our company and promotional material from some of our partners. We will not give, sell, rent, loan, or otherwise disclose to any third parties outside of Global Name Registry (and/or its outsourced providers only to the extent necessary for the operation of the registry), except when we have given you notice or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (i) comply with legal process, (ii) enforce the service terms and conditions, or (iii) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Global Name Registry, its customers, or the public. We may provide prospective partners, advertisers and other third parties with statistics but such provision will be purely generic and never be tied to a specific user. We may use your contact information to contact you when necessary.
The Privacy Policy set out here only relates to the collection and processing of data on the Web site. The privacy policies of our partners (including parties who provide .name registration services) may differ from our Privacy Policy, and you should verify the precise terms of the privacy policies of such third parties when assessing their websites before providing any personal information. Please note that, when registering a .name , the personal information that you provide at the time of registration will become available on the Whois database and will be accessible by third parties.
Security
At Global Name Registry, security has been put on top of the list from day one. This site has many security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. For users who require added security we will support SSL encryption throughout the whole Global Name Registry website. SSL will provide a secure link between you and our systems that protects against eavesdropping.
Opt Out
From time to time, Global Name Registry may notify .name subscribers of new products, announcements, upgrades and updates. Users may opt-out of receiving these future promotional mailings by sending an email with their name to:
unsubscribe@gnr.com or by contacting us at our mailing address:
