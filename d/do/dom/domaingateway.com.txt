We will ask that you identify yourself and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. The initial procedure to access, correct or delete your personal information is to contact us.
