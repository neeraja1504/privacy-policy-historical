Privacy Statement
We respect your individual privacy. That is why we have adopted this Privacy Statement, which embodies our commitment to the protection of your privacy through adherence to fair electronic information practices. This Privacy Statement puts you, the individual, in control of how your personal information is processed, and you have our promise that we will not electronically process your personal information in any way that is incompatible with this Privacy Statement. This Privacy Statement protects your privacy by:
informing you about-
the types of personal information Rebel.ca collects about you through its Web sites;
how it collects that information;
the general purposes for which it collects such information;
the types of organizations to which it discloses the information;
the choices and means by which individuals may limit its use and disclosure.
empowering you to choose-
whether and how certain personal information you provide is used (where such use is unrelated to the uses for which you originally disclosed it); and
whether and the manner in which a third party uses certain personal information you provide (where such use is unrelated to the uses for which you originally disclosed it).
assuring you that Rebel.ca-
takes reasonable precautions to protect personal information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction;
implements reasonable policies and procedures to ensure that personal information is kept only for the purposes for which it has been gathered;
uses reasonable measures to ensure that we have accurately and completely recorded the personal information you have provided; and
provides you reasonable access to your personal information as well as procedures for correcting or modifying that information where appropriate.
ensuring accountability to individuals who believe that Rebel.ca has not complied with these privacy principles.
If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Statement, please contact service@Rebel.ca.
How We Put Information To Good Use
We use information about you for purposes of monitoring and improving our internal operations, as well as to ensure that we properly perform the services you have requested.
We also use the information we collect to monitor and improve our internal operations, as well as to improve the experience of users in our network of sites. For example, we may correlate Web site traffic information with data about individual users. We may also break down overall usage statistics according to customers' domain names, browser types, and MIME types by reading this information from the browser string (information contained in every user's browser).
Another example of our use of information to enhance the experience of users in our network of sites is our reliance on cookie files. We use cookie files to make it easier for users to access our site or services. A cookie file is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you've visited. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. We use cookies to track user traffic patterns (as described above) when you submit your email address to Rebel.ca's. We may use a cookie to store a unique, random user ID. We use this ID to identify you anonymously in our database and to track the pages you visit on our site. This type of temporary cookie lasts only for your current session on our web page and is not used after your session expires. We use it primarily to keep track of information during your session, such as what domain you have select to register as you step through the various registration forms.
If you've set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie. You may refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser; however, some of our sites may require a cookie for access.
Finally, we use the information we collect to direct important notices and information affecting your account or services, as well as to provide general information that may be of interest to you, including newsletters, surveys, contest and sweepstake announcements, and information about our service or product offerings or the offerings of our business affiliates. You may opt out of receiving information from us simply by notifying us of your desire in accordance with the opt-out instructions contained in any information message you receive from us. Note, however, that in order to fulfill our service obligations to you, we must continue sending you notices and other important information affecting your account or services.
With Whom We May Share Information
We may share certain information about you with those of our vendors who are responsible for performing other necessary services that you require. We will not share such information with other third parties, except in response to formal requests (e.g., subpoena or court order) made in connection with reasonable dispute resolution mechanisms, litigation or arbitration proceedings directly relating to a domain name registration or other services we provide. In the event that certain services provided to you by or through Rebel.ca or one of its business partners, are to be provided to you by a substitute service provider, your information may be transferred to the substitute service provider provided that such substitute entity agrees to be bound by the terms of this privacy statement in effect at the time of performance of the services.
Additionally, we may share information that is not of a sensitive nature, with carefully selected business partners, including those who offer services that complement those provided by us or which may otherwise be of interest to you. We may collect your information and aggregate it with other data for statistical purposes, and share such aggregated data with other business partners.
Our Accountability To You
By purchasing our services, you obtain the protections of, and consent to the data processing practices described in, this Privacy Statement. When you use our services, you also represent to us that you have provided notice to, and obtained consent from, any third party individuals whose personal data you supply to us with regard to: (i) the purposes for which such third party's personal data have been collected, (ii) the intended recipients or categories of recipients of the third party's personal data, (iii) which of the third party's data are obligatory and which data, if any, are voluntary, and (iv) how the third party can access and, if necessary, rectify the data held about them.
In addition to the privacy protections that we provide, our employees, agents and business partners are independently responsible for ensuring compliance with this Privacy Statement, as described below.
Employee Accountability
Only those Rebel.ca employees that have a legitimate business purpose for accessing and handling personal information obtained by us are given authorization to do so. The unauthorized access or use of such information by a Rebel.ca employee is prohibited and constitutes grounds for disciplinary action.
Additionally, our information management systems are configured in such a way as to block or inhibit employees from accessing information that they have no authority to access.
The Accountability of Rebel.ca's Agents and Business Partners
Our trusted vendors and business partners are responsible for processing or handling some of the information that we receive. These vendors and business partners are not authorized to use such information for purposes beyond those specified by us and are required to preserve the confidentiality with which we treat such information.
If you feel that Rebel.ca, or any of our agents, representatives or employees, is violating this Privacy Statement, please contact us via email at service@Rebel.ca.
