A word about advertisements
All of the complete games are free to play! In order to keep it that way, I have advertising spaces. I am not responsible for the content on the advertisements, however, I do care that they are not offensive, so e-mail me if you see something you don't like! I can ban ads that people find inappropriate so let me know.
