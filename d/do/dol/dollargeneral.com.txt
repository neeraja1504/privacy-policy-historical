Browser and device information
App usage data
Information collected through cookies, pixel tags and other technologies
Temporary or persistent unique device identifiers
Demographic information and other information provided by you
Aggregated information
If we are required to treat Other Information as Personally Identifiable Information under applicable law, then we may use it for the purposes for which we use and disclose Personally Identifiable Information as detailed in this Policy.
We and our service providers may collect Other Information in a variety of ways, including:
Through your browser or device: Certain information may be collected via your browsers or through your device, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, operating system name and version, device manufacturer and model, language, Internet browser type and version, the name and version of the Services (such as the App) you are using, battery usage, battery charge and battery state.  We use this information to ensure that the Services function properly.
Through your use of the App: When you download and use the App, we and our service providers may track and collect App usage data, such as the date and time the App on your device accesses our servers and what information and files have been downloaded to the App based on your device number.
Using Cookies: Cookies are pieces of information stored directly on the computer that you are using.  Cookies allow us to collect information such as browser type, time spent on the Services, pages visited, language preferences, and other anonymous traffic data.  We and our service providers use the information for security purposes, to facilitate navigation, to display information more effectively, to personalize your experience while using the Services and to recognize your computer in order to assist your use of the Services.  We also gather statistical information about use of the Services in order to continually improve their design and functionality, understand how they are used and assist us with resolving questions regarding them.  Cookies further allow us to select which of our advertisements or offers are most likely to appeal to you and display them while you are on the Services.  We may also use cookies or other technologies to track responses to our online advertisements and marketing emails.If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies or be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer to your computer of a particular cookie (or cookies) from a particular site.  You may also wish to refer to http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html.  If, however, you do not accept cookies, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of the Services.  For example, we may not be able to recognize your computer, and you may need to log in every time you visit.  You also may not receive advertising or other offers from us that are relevant to your interests and needs.
Using pixel tags and other similar technologies: Pixel tags (also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) may be used in connection with some Services to, among other things, track the actions of users of the Services (including email recipients), measure the success of our marketing campaigns and compile statistics about usage of the Services and response rates.
We use Google Analytics, which uses cookies and other, similar technologies to collect information about use of the Services and reports website trends. You can learn about Google’s practices by going to http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/?partners/, and opt out of them by downloading the opt-out browser add-on available at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.
IP Address: Your IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer or mobile device that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP).  An IP address may be identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user accesses the Services, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited.  Collecting IP addresses is standard practice and is done automatically by many websites, applications and other services.  We use IP addresses for purposes such as calculating usage levels, diagnosing server problems and administering the Services. We may also derive your approximate location from your IP address.
Physical Location: We may collect the physical location of your device and/or other location attributes (such as fenceID, speed, altitude, accuracy, and bearing) by, for example, using satellite, cell phone tower or WiFi signals.  We may use your device’s physical location and/or location attributes to provide you with personalized location-based services and content.  We may also share your device’s physical location, combined with information about what advertisements you viewed and other information we collect, with our marketing partners to enable them to provide you with more personalized content and to study the effectiveness of advertising campaigns.  In some instances, you may be permitted to allow or deny such uses and/or sharing of your device’s location, but if you do, we and/or our marketing partners may not be able to provide you with the applicable personalized services and content.  Geolocation services can be turned off or on via the Settings Area of the Apps or in the Location Services area of your mobile device.

We may use and disclose Other Information for any purpose, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law.  In some instances, we may combine Other Information with Personally Identifiable Information (such as combining your name with your location).  If we do, we will treat the combined information as Personally Identifiable Information as long as it is combined.
8.             Our Advertising
We may use third-party advertising companies to serve advertisements regarding goods and services that may be of interest to you when you access and use the Services and other websites or online services, based on information relating to your access to and use of the Services and other websites or online services on any of your devices, as well as on information received from third parties.  To do so, these companies may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser (including through the use of pixel tags).  They may also use these technologies, along with information they collect about your online use, to recognize you across the devices you use, such as a mobile phone and a laptop.
