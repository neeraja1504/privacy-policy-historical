We save e-mail and notes on correspondence with those who contact us. We also keep the contact information of those who buy our products and register with us. We do not and never will collect any other information pertaining to our clients.
When you buy one of our products, you get only the product as described. We have never and will never produce or use any spy ware or malware of any kind.

If and only if you register and opt to receive notices, we will inform you of our sales and new products.
Under no circumstances will we send you an e-mail for any other purpose.
Again, we will not deliberately provide of our clients' information to any other company or individual (with the exception of our credit card processor). We take reasonable steps to protect such information from hackers etc.
