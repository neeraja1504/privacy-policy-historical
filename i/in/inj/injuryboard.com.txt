(b) A lawyer may reveal such information to the extent the lawyer reasonably believes necessary:
(1) To prevent the client from committing a criminal act that the lawyer believes is likely to result in imminent death or substantial bodily harm; or
(2) to establish a claim or defense on behalf of the lawyer in a controversy between the lawyer and the client, to establish a defense to a criminal charge or civil claim against the lawyer based upon conduct in which the client was involved, or to respond to allegations in any proceeding concerning the lawyer's representation of a client.

The Legal Examiner,
209 S. Howard Avenue
Tampa, FL 33606
The Legal Examiner is the leading personal injury legal site for consumers. However, The Legal Examiner is neither a law firm nor a legal referral service, nor a doctor's office. As such, this site should not be used as a substitute for an attorney's advice or a medical doctor's diagnosis. The Legal Examiner provides general legal, health, injury and medical information. However, our website does not provide specific medical or legal advice for an individual's specific matter or concern. Instead, the information we provide is general in nature, and you are encouraged to speak with an Injury Board member attorney regarding your specific legal questions.
If you are concerned with a specific medical condition, we urge you to seek a doctor's advice. We cannot provide such medical advice to you. Additionally, if you have a specific legal problem, we encourage you to contact an attorney. As laws vary from state to state and change over time, only a licensed attorney can provide you with specific legal advice. Furthermore, please be conscious of Statutes of Limitation in your state, the time periods within which you are allowed to bring a claim. There are sometime exceptions to these time limits depending on special circumstances, so consult with a lawyer in your state if you have questions about Statutes of Limitations.
The Legal Examiner allows you to contact one of our member firms free of charge. By contacting a member firm, you have not entered into an attorney/client relationship. Such a relationship can only be established after both parties have signed a written document. Injury Board member firms sponsor the efforts to create, maintain, and provide content for The Legal Examiner so that users of the site may access important safety, legal and injury information that may be unavailable or difficult to find elsewhere. Should you enter into an attorney/client relationship with an The Legal Examiner member firm, The Legal Examiner does not receive any referral fee from the member form, nor does it receive any portion of the attorneys' or law firms' fees upon resolution of a matter.
A great deal of the information provided on this website is provided by our members and other third parties, and these parties are responsible for the contents of the information they have provided. The Legal Examiner is not responsible for the actions and/or inactions of Injury Board member firms. Although Injury Board seeks only members who are competent, ethical, and experienced, we are unable to guarantee your satisfaction with any Injury Board member's answers or services provided.
Furthermore, you are not required or obligated to retain the services of our member firms in order to use this website. Certain state bar associations may consider an The Legal Examiner membership to be a form of advertising, and require that we inform our users that the hiring of a lawyer is an important decision that should not be based solely on advertisement. Such a decision should only be made after the review and careful consideration of a firm's experience and qualifications.
While we make every reasonable effort to provide useful, timely and accurate information, we cannot guarantee the correctness of this information, nor can we guarantee that we carry information on every conceivable injury subject. In addition, Although we closely monitor government agency initiated product recalls, alerts and warnings, we may from time to time be unaware of certain recalls and safety alerts, and encourage you to be vigilant in your research and use of information provided by government regulatory agencies such as the FDA.
