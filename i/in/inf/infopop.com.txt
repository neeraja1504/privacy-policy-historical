Information That We Collect
Information That You Provide Us: When you sign up for any account or service operated by Social Strata, we store all information that you provide to us. This may include personal information like email addresses, your name, passwords, phone numbers, birth date, gender, and address information. For services that require payment, we also collect credit card information, which is stored in encrypted form on secure servers, including PCI-compliant third-party vendors. Once you register and sign in to one of our services, you are not anonymous to us. In addition, we collect and store information based on the services that you are using. For instance, we may store the names of communities that you join, the people that you mark as your buddies, content that you watch, etc.

Most browsers are configured to accept cookies, but you may change your browser's settings so that you are informed every time a cookie is set, or to prevent cookies from being set at all. Please note, however, that many Social Strata services do not function properly if cookies are disabled. Advertisers or other third parties do not have access to Social Strata's cookies. However, such advertisers may set their own cookies. Such cookies are subject to the advertisers' own privacy policies, not this Policy.

Uses of Collected Information
Social Strata uses collected information to enhance your experience online, authenticate you when you sign in, send notifications, fulfill your requests for services, contact you, customize the advertising or content that you see, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients.
Do Not Track Notice
Social Strata does not track your activity between sites using our services, or from one of our sites to another; therefore "do not track" requests are not applicable for our platforms and services. If you are on a Hoop.la site that is serving third party ads, that particular ad partner is responsible for its response to your browser's Do Not Track request.
Information Sharing
Social Strata does not share personal information with other individuals, organizations, or companies outside of Social Strata, unless we have your consent or unless:
We are working with trusted partners who agree to abide by the rules of this Policy or have signed a confidentiality agreement.
We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, in response to a lawful request by public authorities (including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements), or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.
We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, or potential threats to the physical safety of any person.
If Social Strata is involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
We are transmitting data in order to fulfill a service. For instance, credit card transactions are routed through transaction partners like Recurly and other financial transaction processing firms. Also, we may use Akismet to detect spam, and provide information such as your display name, email address and and IP address, but only for sites using our Comment Spam features. This information is only conveyed in order to render service, however, and is not shared for any other purpose.
We are not responsible for the processing of your personal information by any third party, other than those third parties acting as our subcontractors to process data on our behalf. We remain liable and responsible for the data processing undertaken by our subcontractors on our behalf.
Note that we may share certain aggregated, non-personal information, such as demographic information, browser type, and usage statistics. In such cases, the information does not identify you personally.
Profile information collected by sites hosted by Social Strata is collected by the sites themselves. Thus, you should review the privacy policy for each site before joining sites hosted by Social Strata.
While Social Strata does not provide any personal information to advertisers, it is possible that, if you view a certain ad, it may have been delivered to you based on targeting demographic criteria (for example, men who are between 18-24 years of age). Please note that in such situations, the advertiser does not know any specific personal information about you. You understand, however, that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet its particular targeting criteria. Social Strata may also share conversion data with advertisers.
Data Integrity
Social Strata processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected, and in accordance with the Principles. We review our data collection, storage, and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store, and process the personal information needed to provide our services. We depend on our users to update or correct their own personal information.

Social Strata periodically reviews its compliance with the Principles.
