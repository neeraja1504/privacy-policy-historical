Types of Information Collected
In order to better provide you with our numerous services, we collect two types of information about our users: Personal Information and Non-Personal Information.

When you order services through MNHost.com, we request certain personally identifiable information from you on our order form to us to allow us to process your order, provide you with the services you order from us, and to provide ongoing technical support for your account.

Disclosure of Personal Information
We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order only to provide service to that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to provide service. In the event that this policy changes, we will provide you with an opportunity to opt out or otherwise prohibit the disclosure of your information to third parties for any purpose other than your ordering and ongoing use of our services.
We do not sell, trade, or rent your Personal Information to others.
