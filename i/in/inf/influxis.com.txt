Privacy Policy - Influxis
Influxis (“Influxis,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) respects your privacy and is committed to protecting the Personal Data it collects. The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to inform you of how we protect your privacy when accessing or using Influxis’ Services.
This Privacy Policy applies to Influxis’ Services that link to, or reference, this Privacy Policy, and describes the ways Influxis collects and uses your personal information and the choices you have regarding collection, use, maintenance, access and transmission of your personal information. Capitalized terms not expressly defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning found in the Influxis Service Agreement. By utilizing the Influxis Service, including without limitation the website or otherwise providing your Personal Data to Influxis via any other means, you or the entity you represent (“you” or “your”) accept and consent to the rights, obligations and practices described in this Privacy Policy.
1. Who does the Privacy Policy apply to?
This Privacy Policy applies to all Clients of the Influxis Service, and Visitors to the Influxis website. In the case of Clients, Client shall be responsible for (i) informing their customers (“End Users”), if any, of the existence of this Privacy Policy and (ii) agreeing to this Privacy Policy, as amended, updated or modified from time to time, on behalf of his, her or its End Users.
In the case of End Users, (a person who uses a Client’s application or website that incorporates the Influxis Service) Influxis has no direct relationship with such End User and Influxis will not collect their Personal Data directly from them. In the event an End User seeks to access, correct, amend or delete data, the End User should contact Influxis’ Client.
If you are a person who has directly signed up with Influxis for the use of Influxis’ Services and you seek to access, correct, amend, or delete data, you should contact Influxis directly. If requested to remove data under either scenario, Influxis will respond within a reasonable timeframe.
2. What Personal Data is Collected by Influxis?

The Personal Data we collect may include, but is not limited to, your full name, email address, phone number, account log-in credentials, billing address, credit card information, IP address and any information you choose to include in your correspondence to Influxis.
In the case of an End User, if End User utilizes a Client’s website or application that incorporates Influxis’ Service, depending on how the Client has implemented our Service we may receive End Users’ Personal Data from Client to transmit across our Service and store on behalf of Client. In this case, the End User should direct all requests regarding the Personal Data collected directly to the Client. It is the Client’s responsibility to obtain express consent of End Users to transfer their Personal Data to Influxis. Influxis applies the same security measures as described in Section 7 to End User’s Personal Data received from Client.

Cookies cannot be executed as code or used to deliver a virus. Other servers cannot read cookies and personal information cannot be gathered from cookies.

A web beacon, also known as a web bug, is a small graphic (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel), that is embedded in a web advertisement, email, or page on Influxis’ website, which is invisible to you. When you view a page on Influxis’ website, an e-mail or an advertisement, your web browser will request the web beacon from a web server, which in turn will set a cookie in your web browser containing a unique identifier. This unique identifier will be linked to log information that is used to track your usage of Influxis’ website in order to determine the effectiveness of content and advertising campaigns.
Influxis does not collect personal information about you as part of a web visit, but web visit information may be tied to other information (including personal information) that Influxis collects from you via chat, web forms, and the other means Influxis describes in this Privacy Policy.
