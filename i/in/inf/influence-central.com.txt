Cookies
When you visit our website, we may assign your computer one or more cookies, to facilitate access to our site, personalize your online experience, and help provide information that is relevant to you.

Through the use of a cookie, we also may automatically collect information about your online activity on our site, such as the web pages you visit, the links you click, and the searches you conduct on our site. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies.

Sharing of Your Information
Personal information
We do not share your personal information with others except as indicated below or when we inform you and give you an opportunity to opt out of having your personal information shared. We may share your personal information with our authorized service providers that perform certain services on our behalf. These services may include delivering packages, providing customer service and marketing assistance, performing business and sales analysis, supporting our website functionality, and supporting contests, giveaways, surveys and other features offered through our website, by phone, or by mail. These service providers may have access to personal information needed to perform their functions but are not permitted to share or use such information for any other purpose. When you engage in promotions offered through our website or other services, we may share personal information with the businesses with which we partner to offer you those products, services, promotions, contests and/or giveaways. When you elect to engage in a particular merchant’s offer or program, you authorize us to provide your e-mail address and other information to that merchant.  When this information is provided to a third party, it may only be used for the purposes you have agreed to (by signing up for a particular offer, coupon, sample). Any third parties to whom we may disclose personal information may have their own privacy policies, which describe how they use and disclose personal information. Those policies will govern use, handling and disclosure of your personal information once we have shared it with those third parties as described in this Privacy Policy. If you want to learn more about their privacy practices, we encourage you to visit the websites of or to otherwise contact those third parties. These entities or their servers may be located either inside or outside the United States.
Aggregated and Non-Personal Information
We may share aggregated and non-personal information we collect on the site. We may also share it with third parties to develop and deliver targeted marketing on our websites, on websites of third parties, or by other means. We may combine non-personal information we collect with additional non-personal information collected from other sources. We also may share aggregated information with third parties, including advisors, advertisers and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis. For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors to our website and the most popular features or services accessed. This information does not contain any personal information and may be used to develop website or other content and services that we hope you and other customers will find of interest and to target content and advertising.
Legal Matters; Safety
We may, without your consent, access and disclose your information, any communications sent or received by you, and any other information that we may have about you or your account as may be permitted or required by law (including, but not limited to, court order or subpoena), or to prevent or investigate suspected fraud, violations of our Terms of Service, or activity that appears to us to be illegal or may expose us to legal liability. Additionally, we may disclose your information in situations that we believe to be emergencies involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person or property if we believe that your information in any way relates to that threat.
Sale of Business or Assets
In the event that Influence Central, substantially all of its assets, or a line of business are acquired or merged with another company, personally identifiable information of our members may be one of the assets sold or merged in connection with that transaction. Influence Central will notify our members of such a change in ownership or transfer of assets by posting a notice on our site.
Communications from the Website
Special Offers and Updates
We consistently have the opportunity to send you information on products, services, special deals, and promotions offered by Influence Central and/or a third party. In cases where Influence Central is presenting an offer by a third party, the offer will be brought to you by Influence Central and typically fulfilled by the third party. If you accept the offer, you will become a customer of the company that is fulfilling the offer and we will not have control over their use of the personally identifiable information that you provide to them when you accept the offer.
E-Mail and Newsletters
Influence Central may use your information to send you e-newsletters, updates and communications about Influence Central. You may opt-out of receiving future emails as described at the bottom of each communication from Influence Central. If you don’t want to opt-out of all communications be sure to select ‘Update Profile and Subscription Preferences’ instead of ‘Unsubscribe From All Emails’. Unsubscribing from all emails ultimately removes you from program participation as well.
Service-Related Announcements
We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email.
Customer Service
Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will send you a welcoming e-mail to verify you. We will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account. We will communicate with you by e-mail or telephone, in accordance with your wishes.
Third Parties
Ad Servers
We may use third party advertising service providers and/or technologies to serve ads when you visit our website, or in our e-mail newsletters. If your browser is set up to accept cookies, our third-party advertising service providers and/or technologies may place cookies or web beacons on your computer when you visit our website or interact with our email messages. Please note that this happens whether or not you click on an advertisement placed by these companies.
Surveys/Contests
We may use a third-party service provider to conduct surveys or contests; that company will be prohibited from using our users’ personally identifiable information for any other purpose.
Links to Other Sites
This website contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by Influence Central. Please be aware that Influence Central is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other websites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave Influence Central’s website, and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information.
Additional Information

Security
Influence Central has taken appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. In addition, we use encryption in the transmission of your sensitive personal information between your system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your personal information. We want you to feel confident using our website, but no system can be completely secure. So although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure. You should also take care with how you handle and disclose your personal information.
Children’s Privacy
We are committed to protecting the privacy of children. You should be aware that this website is not intended or designed to attract children under the age of 13. We do not collect personally identifiable information from any person we actually know is a child under the age of 13.
Changes in this Privacy Statement
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by e-mail, or by means of a notice on our home page.
