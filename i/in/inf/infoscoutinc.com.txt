In addition, we may use this information to keep you informed of new features and product developments as well as to provide more relevant offers to you.
To contact you
We may use the contact information we receive from you or third parties to contact you via email, direct mail, telephone or other channels such as text messaging, Facebook and Twitter, in each case provided we are permitted by law to send such communications to you and you have not otherwise opted-out of receiving them.

For market research purposes
We use the information we collect to provide clients with anonymous market research reports.

However, your data shall NOT be sold to third-parties for the purposes of marketing to you.
To develop, evaluate, improve and deliver our products and services
We use the information we collect to develop, evaluate, improve and deliver our product and services, and the products and services of Rewards Program Sponsors, Award Providers, Participating Retailers, or others.
