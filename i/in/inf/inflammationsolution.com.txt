What do We use Your information for?
Our primary purpose in collecting Personal Information is Our legitimate interest to facilitate the services on the Website. Any of the information We collect from You may be used in one of the following ways:
To improve customer service (Your information helps Us to more effectively respond to customer service requests and support needs).
To create and manage Your account and to process transactions related to and arising from the sale and purchase of goods from Our Website.
To help diagnose problems with Our Website, to administer Our Website, and to enhance Our Website for optimal user experience.

Although the above describes Our purpose in collecting Your information, in many situations We have more than one purpose.  For example, if You complete an online purchase We may collect Your information to perform Our contract with You, but We also collect Your information as We have a legitimate interest in maintaining Your Information after Your transaction is complete so that We can quickly and easily respond to any questions about Your order.  As a result, Our collection and processing of Your information is based in different contexts upon Your consent, Our need to perform a contract, Our obligations under law, and/or Our legitimate interest in conducting Our business.
Your Choices
You can make the following choices regarding Your Personal Information:
Promotional emails. You may choose to provide Us with Your email address for the purpose of allowing Us to send free newsletters, surveys, offers, and other promotional materials to You, as well as targeted offers from third parties.
