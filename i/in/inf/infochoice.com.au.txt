Our privacy commitment
InfoChoice Pty Ltd (‘we’, ‘us’, ‘our’ and ‘InfoChoice’) is committed to protecting the privacy of your personal information. This policy explains how InfoChoice manages the personal information that we collect, use and disclose and how to contact us if you have any further queries about our management of your personal information. This policy does not cover personal information collected or held by InfoChoice or any of its related bodies corporate (as applicable) about its employees.
InfoChoice is bound by the Australian Privacy Principles in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) ( Privacy Act ) which regulate how we may collect, use, disclose and store personal information, and how individuals may access and correct personal information held about them. InfoChoice is also required to comply with the Spam Act 2003 (Cth) and the Do Not Call Register Act 2006 (Cth).
If you have any questions regarding InfoChoice’s Privacy Policy or would like us to send you a copy of this policy please contact our Privacy Officer using the details provided below. Our Privacy Policy may be amended from time to time. The current version will be posted on our website.
What is personal information?
Personal information  is any information or an opinion, in any form and whether true or not, about an identified individual or an individual who is reasonably identifiable. Examples include an individual's name, address, contact number and email address.
Sensitive information  is a special category of personal information. Sensitive information includes health information and information about a person's race, ethnic origin, political opinions, membership of political, professional or trade associations, religious or philosophical beliefs, sexual preferences and criminal history.
How does InfoChoice collect and hold your personal information?
InfoChoice will only collect personal information about you by lawful and fair means. InfoChoice collects personal information in a variety of ways. It is InfoChoice’s usual practice to collect personal information directly from you (or from your authorised representative), for example when:
you enquire about or seek a quotation for a product or service offered by our participating providers;
you apply for or purchase a product offered by an InfoChoice business and/or our participating providers;
you contact us by telephone, mail, email or online;
you visit our website (including when you request a quote or to be contacted by us);
we supply any other products or services to you; or
you enter into any trade promotions, competitions or other offers with InfoChoice or its partners.
Sometimes we collect personal information about customers or potential customers from a third party or a publicly available source, or from marketing and similar lists legally acquired by us.
If you provide us with personal information about another person (such as a family member), please make sure that you have their consent to do so and that you tell them about this policy.
What kinds of personal information does InfoChoice collect and hold?
The kinds of personal information that we collect and hold about you will depend on the circumstances of collection, including whether we collect the information from you as a customer, participating provider, contractor, supplier, stakeholder, job applicant or in some other capacity.
For example, if you request a quote for a product or service offered by our participating providers, we may collect your name, address, email address, telephone number, date of birth and any other information required to provide you with the quote. If you deal with us in some other capacity (for example, as a participating provider, a supplier or a stakeholder), we may collect your name, contact details and any other information you choose to provide to us.
Any personal information that you provide via our website or contact centre (for example, for comparison purposes, to obtain a quote or to purchase products) is collected and stored by InfoChoice.
To provide some of our services, we may be required to collect and hold your sensitive information. We will only collect sensitive information about you with your consent (unless we are otherwise allowed or required by law to collect that information).
If you provide your personal information to a third party via InfoChoice (for example, to purchase products or services on a third-party website which is linked to InfoChoice) that information is collected and managed by those third parties. You should familiarise yourself with their privacy policy prior to deciding whether you wish to provide them with your information.
We may record and monitor calls that you make to us in certain circumstances. For example, calls to our contact centre are recorded and monitored for training and customer service purposes and to meet our regulatory obligations.
Some of the products offered by our participating providers can cover more than one person (for example, home loans). If you provide us with information about another person, you must obtain that person’s permission to give us the information and inform them of this policy. If we are not able to collect your personal information, we may not be able to provide you with our products or services or do business with you or the organisation with which you are connected.
How does InfoChoice use your personal information?
We use personal information for a variety of reasons including to:
