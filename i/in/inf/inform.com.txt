We may occasionally use your name and email address to send you notifications regarding new services we offer that we think you may find valuable. We may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from business partners or other companies. We may also create compilations of information that are not personally-identifying and provide these compilations to other companies to help them understand the shopping patterns or general interests of visitors to the Websites.
7. Use of Cookies
We use cookies, tags and similar technologies to recognize your preferences and effectively and efficiently administer the Websites. We use the information we collect to enhance your visit to the Websites and provide you with information tailored to your interests. The information collected on our behalf does not contain your name, address, email address or any other personally identifiable information. You may elect to refuse or delete cookies, however, doing so may affect your use of some portions of the Websites and the services INFORM provides.
We use third-party tracking and advertising providers such as Auditude and Quantcast to act on our behalf. The third-party tracking and advertising technology that we use on the Websites uses information derived from your visits to the Websites to target advertising to the Websites. In addition, our advertisers may use other third-party advertising technology to target advertising on the Websites and other sites. They may track and analyze your usage of the Websites through the use of cookies, pixel tags, web beacons and similar technologies. They may collect and share with us usage information about visits to the Websites and use of the INFORM services. They also may measure and research the effectiveness of our advertisements, track page usage and paths followed during and after your use of the Websites and the INFORM services, help us target the advertisements on the Websites, and track use of our advertisements and other links from marketing partners' sites to the INFORM services.
To “opt-out” of such third-party cookies, go to http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp and select Collective, Quantcast, YuMe, Specific Media and ValueClick Media as your opt out choices.
8. Disclosure of Information
INFORM is committed to maintaining your trust and we want you to understand when and with whom we may share information collected about you.
Authorized third-party service providers. We share your information with third-party vendors who help us with specialized services, including customer support, email and text message deployment, business analytics, marketing, and data processing. These third parties are allowed to use your information to help us provide our services and not for any other purpose.
Business transfers. We may share your information in connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of a INFORM Website, a merger, consolidation, asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.
Legal requirements. We may disclose information about our users, including contact information, to respond to subpoenas, court orders, legal process, and other law enforcement measures, and to comply with other legal obligations.
Protect our Websites and users. We may disclose information to protect and defend the legal rights, interests, and safety of INFORM Websites, other INFORM companies, and their employees, agents, and contractors (including enforcing our agreements), to protect the safety and security of users of the Websites and members of the public, and as otherwise disclosed in our Terms of Use.
9. Submissions
Any personal information you choose to provide to us with your submissions posted to this site may appear on the site, but only to identify you as the author of the submission, unless you expressly authorize us to make further use of the information on the site. If you voluntarily disclose or permit disclosure of personal information, that information can also be collected and used by others. If you submit to the site any comments, photographs, videos, music, text or other content, you grant to INFORM the unlimited, perpetual, royalty-free right to use your name, voice, likeness and other personal information in connection with such submission in any media, now known or hereafter devised, throughout the world.
10. Privacy Policy for Children Under 13
In accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (commonly referred to as “COPPA”), we do not require children under the age of 13 to provide us with any more information than is reasonably necessary to participate and make use of this site and under no circumstances do we require children under the age of 13 to provide us with any personal information. Children under the age of 13 should not submit or post any personal information without the written consent of their parents or legal guardians. If you are a child under the age of 13 and want to submit your personal information to us, you should ask your parents to send an email to privacy@inform.com specifically allowing us to collect your personal information through this site. By doing so, you allow us to alert your parent or guardian about the Websites’ Privacy Policy. We do not intend to sell, license or trade any such information collected to third parties. Parents may review or change the personal information of their children provided to us or further refuse our collection of such information by sending an email to privacy@inform.com.
11. Partner Sites / Linked Sites
Our site features several activities, which are co-sponsored or operated by other sites. These activities will be identifiable by their co-branding. While these activities originate on the Websites, they may link to other sites not operated by INFORM. This Privacy Policy does not cover the practices of third parties, including those that may disclose information to INFORM. We have no control over the privacy practices or the content of any of our co-sponsors and strongly recommend that you check their privacy policies before engaging in these activities. You may be asked to provide information about yourself to register for a service offered by a co-branded partner. In doing so, you may be providing your information to both us and the co-branded partner, or we may share your information with the co-branded partner. Additionally, our site contains links to other sites, including those of advertisers. We have no control over the privacy practices of advertisers or other sites to which we provide links from this site. For example, if you click on a banner advertisement, the click takes you off this site. These other sites may use cookies, collect data or solicit personal information. We strongly recommend that you check the applicable privacy policy of the site to which you are linking.
12. Security of Information
We use commercially reasonable efforts to keep your personally identifiable information secure. Unfortunately, no electronic communication over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. While we strive to take care to protect your personally identifiable information, INFORM cannot warrant the security of any information that you submit to us, and you do so at your own risk. We do offer secured-server transactions that encrypt your information in transit to thwart someone from intercepting it and misusing it when collecting credit card information for online purchases. We also store any personal information, including credit card numbers, in a secure area to which the general public does not have access.
13. Transfer of Data Internationally
INFORM is headquartered in the United States. Please be aware that information you provide to us or we obtain as a result of your use of the Websites may be collected in your country and subsequently transferred to the United States or another country in accordance with applicable law. The privacy and data protection laws in another country may not be equivalent to such laws in your country of residence. By using and participating in the Websites or providing us with your information, you consent to the collection, international transfer, storage, and processing of your information.
14. Updating Personal Information
If you would like to change any contact or billing information, or if you no longer desire to receive any marketing communications from INFORM or our partners, please email us at privacy@inform.com. Please note that we may need to retain some information about you in order to satisfy our legal and security obligations. For example, some of your information may remain in back-up storage even if you ask us to delete it. In some cases, you may be entitled under local laws to access or object to the processing of information that we hold relating to you.
15. Changes in Privacy Policy
We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time, and will post any changes as soon as they go into effect without prior notice to you. Any such changes are effective as of the date such changes are posted on this page. Your continued usage after such changes are posted constitutes acceptance of each revised Privacy Policy. Please check this page periodically to view our most current Privacy Policy.
