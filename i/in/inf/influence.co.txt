Also, both we and the third party may have access to certain information about you and your use of the Service and the third party website or service. In addition, we may receive information about you in connection with other users’ use of Third Party Interactions (e.g., we may learn that you are a “friend” or “connection” of the third party or receive other information about you that the other user enables us to receive).
The information we collect in connection with Third Party Interactions is subject to this Privacy Policy. The information collected and stored by the third party remains subject to the third party’s privacy practices, including whether the third party continues to share information with us, the types of information shared, and your choices with regard to what is visible to others on that third party website or service.
Community Features. The Service may provide you the opportunity to participate and post User Content publicly through reviews, surveys, interactive features, or other communication functionality (“Community Features”). We may provide functionality for you to submit or post User Content through Community Features, by linking the Service to a third party service, or otherwise. Please note that certain information, such as your name, may be publicly displayed on the Service along with your User Content. User Content consisting of uploaded files may contain metadata, which may contain Personal Information or other information about or relating to you. You may wish to remove metadata from your files before transmitting such files to us. Note that anything you post through Community Features is public – others will have access to your User Content and may use it or share it with third parties. If you choose to voluntarily disclose Personal Information, that information will be considered public information and the protections of this Privacy Policy will not apply. If you submit User Content, it may be published online or offline at any time. In addition, we may use your User Content and any excerpt from your User Content in connection with our advertising, marketing, publicity and promotional activities.

In such a case, we will make reasonable efforts to require the recipient to honor this Privacy Policy.
In this section, we describe the rights and choices available to all users. Users who are located within the European Union can find additional information about their rights below.

Cookies.  We may allow service providers and other third parties to use cookies and similar technologies to track your browsing activity over time and across the Service and third party websites.  For more details, see our Cookie Policy.
Targeted online advertising. Some of the business partners that collect information about users’ activities of the Service may be members of organizations or programs that provide choices to individuals regarding the use of their browsing behavior or mobile application usage for purposes of targeted advertising.
Users may opt out of receiving targeted advertising on websites through members of the Network Advertising Initiative by clicking here or the Digital Advertising Alliance by clicking here. European users may opt out of receiving targeted advertising on websites through members of the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance by clicking here, selecting the user’s country, and then clicking “Choices” (or similarly titled link). Please note that we also may work with companies that offer their own opt-out mechanisms and may not participate in the opt-out mechanisms that we linked above.
If you choose to opt-out of targeted advertisements, you will still see advertisements online but they may not be relevant to you. Even if you do choose to opt out, not all companies that serve online behavioral advertising are included in this list, and so you may still receive some cookies and tailored advertisements from companies that are not listed.
Do Not Track.  Some Internet browsers may be configured to send “Do Not Track” signals to the online services that you visit.  We currently do not respond to “Do Not Track” or similar signals.  To find out more about “Do Not Track,” please visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com.
Choosing not to share your personal information. Where we are required by law to collect your personal information, or where we need your personal information in order to provide the Service to you, if you do not provide this information when requested (or you later ask to delete it), we may not be able to provide you with our services.  We will tell you what information you must provide to receive the Service by designating it as required in the Service or on the Sites or through other appropriate means.
De-Linking Third Party Interactions and SNS. The Service enables you to interact with or post content to certain third parties and SNSs. If you would like to discontinue these interactions and connections, please refer to the privacy settings of the third party or SNS to determine how you may adjust our permissions and manage the interactivity between the Services and your social media account.
Third party sites and services.  The Service may contain links to other websites and services operated by third parties.  These links are not an endorsement of, or representation that we are affiliated with, any third party.  We do not control third party websites, applications or services, and are not responsible for their actions.  Other websites and services follow different rules regarding their collection, use and sharing of your personal information.  We encourage you to read their privacy policies to learn more.
In addition, our content may be included on web pages and websites that are not associated with us and over which we have no control. These third parties may collect data through the use of their own cookies, pixel tags or other technology, independently collect information or solicit Personal Information, and may have the ability to track your use of their websites and services. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any third party.
Security practices.  The security of your personal information is important to us.  We employ a number of organizational, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect the personal information we collect.  However, security risk is inherent in all internet and information technologies and we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information.  If you have a user account for the Service, you are solely responsible for maintaining and protecting the confidentiality of your account username, password and other account information in your possession.
International data use.   We are headquartered in the United States and have affiliates and service providers in other countries, and your personal information may be collected, used and stored in the United States or other locations outside of your home country.  Privacy laws in the locations where we handle your personal information may not be as protective as the privacy laws in your home country.
European Union users should read the important information provided below about transfer of personal information outside of the European Union.
Children.  The Service is not directed at, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from, anyone under the age of 16.  If we learn that personal information of someone under the age of 16 has been submitted to us, we will take appropriate steps to delete it.
Customer-administered accounts.   Where the Service is provided to you through your employer or another organization, that organization is the administrator of the Service.  We are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of these organizations, which have their own privacy policies.  Please note that your organization’s administrator may be able to: ****
·       require you to reset your account password;
·       restrict, suspend or terminate your access to the Service;

To send you marketing communications
To create anonymous data
For compliance, fraud prevention and safety

For compliance, fraud prevention and safety

Processing is necessary to comply with our legal obligations.

Use for new purposes
We may use your personal information for reasons not described in this Privacy Policy where permitted by law and the reason is compatible with the purpose for which we collected it.  If we need to use your personal information for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and explain the applicable legal basis.
Retention
We retain personal information where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested; to comply with applicable contractual, legal, tax or accounting requirements; to establish or defend legal claims; or for fraud prevention).  To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible. In some circumstances we may anonymize your personal information (so that it can no longer be associated with you), in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
