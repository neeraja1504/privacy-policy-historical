Your Privacy is important to us. In this Privacy Policy, we’ll disclose how we collect and use personal information, and what rights/options you have over the information that we collect.
Please read our Privacy Policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, and share information about you, along with the choices that you have with respect to that information.

2. What Personal Data We Collect And Why We Collect It
We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so – for example, to provide our website’s services, to communicate with you, or to make improvement to our website’s function.
We collect information in three ways:
If and when you provide information to us,
Automatically through operating our website’s services,
And from outside sources.
The information we collect may include:
Comments
When visitors leave comments on the site, we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.
An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here: https://automattic.com/privacy/. After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.
Media
If you provide us with, e-mail, or upload images to the website, you should avoid uploading images with embedded location data (EXIF GPS) included. Visitors to the website can download and extract any location data from images on the website.
Contact forms
When you fill out a contact form on our site, we collect the data that you type into the form including your name and e-mail address, as well as any other information you relay to us via the text field(s), drop-down or check-box options in the form.
Cookies
If you leave a comment on our site you may opt-in to saving your name, email address and website in cookies. These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave another comment. These cookies will last for one year.
If you have an account and you log in to this site, we will set a temporary cookie to determine if your browser accepts cookies. This cookie contains no personal data and is discarded when you close your browser.
When you log in, we will also set up several cookies to save your login information and your screen display choices. Login cookies last for two days, and screen options cookies last for a year. If you select "Remember Me", your login will persist for two weeks. If you log out of your account, the login cookies will be removed.
We also use some third party services on our site that may also create cookies. Please read our Cookie Policy to understand how we use cookies.
Member Account Profiles
If you become a member of our site, we collect your username, password, first and last names, and IP address for the purposes of granting you access to premium content on the site that you have purchased.
Embedded content from other websites
Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.
These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracing your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.
Analytics
This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses cookies to help websites analyse how visitors use the site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website will be transmitted to, and stored by Google, on servers in the United States . Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage.
You can prevent Google’s collection and use of data by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available under https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en.
Please note that our website has configured Google Analytics with the setting “anonymizeIp”. This guarantees anonymized data collection by masking the last part of your IP address, which makes it impossible to connect an IP with an individual.

4. How We Share Information
We do not sell our users’ private personal information. We share information about you in the limited circumstances spelled out below and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy:
Subsidiaries, Employees, and Independent Contractors: We may disclose information about you to our subsidiaries, our employees, and individuals who are our independent contractors that need to know the information in order to help us provide our website’s services, or to process the information on our behalf. We require our subsidiaries, employees, and independent contractors to follow this Privacy Policy for personal information that we share with them.
Third Party Vendors: We may share information about you with third party vendors who need to know information about you in order to provide their services. This may include vendors that help us provide our services to you (for example, email delivery services that you opt in to), those that assist us with our marketing efforts (e.g. by providing tools for identifying a specific marketing target group or improving our marketing campaigns), those that help us understand and enhance our website’s services (like analytics providers), and companies that re-publish our posts who may need information about you in order to, for example, provide authorship and proper credits back to you. We require vendors to agree to privacy commitments in order to share information with them.
Legal Requests: We may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request.
To Protect Rights, Property, and Others: We may disclose information about you when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of DavyandTracy.com, third parties, or the public at large. For example, if we have a good faith belief that there is an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury, we may disclose information related to the emergency without delay.
Business Transfers: In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company, or in the event that DavyandTracy.com goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would likely be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. If any of these events were to happen, this Privacy Policy would continue to apply to your information and the party receiving your information may continue to use your information, but only consistent with this Privacy Policy.
Aggregated or De-Identified Information: We may share information that has been aggregated or reasonably de-identified, so that the information could not reasonably be used to identify you. For instance, we may publish aggregate statistics about the use of our website’s services and we may share a hashed version of your email address to facilitate customized ad campaigns on other platforms.
Visitor comments may be checked through an automated spam detection service.
Collection of Personal Financial Information by a Payment Service. We use third party payment services (Stripe and PayPal) to enable you to purchase products or make payments through our website. When making a payment, you may be directed to a page operated by that Payment Service. Any information that you provide to a Payment Service will be subject to the applicable Payment Service’s privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy. We have no control over, and are not responsible for, any Payment Service’s use of information collected through any Payment Service.

5. How Long We Retain Your Data
We will retain your information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or allowed by law.
If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.
For users that register on our website, we also store the personal information they provide in their user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.
Remember that even after you cancel your account, or if you ask us to delete your personal information, copies of some information from your account may remain viewable in some circumstances where, for example, you have shared information with social media or other services. Because of the nature of caching technology, your account may not be instantly inaccessible to others. We may also retain backup information related to your account on our servers for some time after cancellation or your request for deletion, for fraud detection or to comply with applicable law or our internal security or recordkeeping policies. It may is not always be possible to completely remove or delete all of your information due to technical constraints or, contractual, financial, or legal requirements.

Your name and e-mail may be retained for a period of time even after you have opted out of electronic communication. We periodically batch delete e-mails from persons who have unsubscribed to our services, or opted out of electronic communications from us. You may request that your name and e-mail address be permanently deleted immediately after opting out of electronic communication by using the Privacy Contact Form at the very bottom of this Privacy Policy notice on our website.
