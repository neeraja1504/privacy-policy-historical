CUSTOMER PROPRIETARY NETWORK INFORMATION NOTICE
inContact offers communications-related services, including local and long distance service, as well as the provisioning of telecommunications equipment. From time to time, those subsidiaries may need or desire to share your Customer Proprietary Network Information (“CPNI”) with other inContact affiliates and/or with third parties involved in assisting with the offering of the services described above and also to enhance our ability to offer products and services tailored to you. Just as the applicable inContact subsidiary(s) is required to protect your CPNI, so too will these third parties. Under no circumstances will inContact and/or any inContact subsidiary sell your CPNI to third parties, or otherwise disclose your CPNI to third parties for marketing purposes in contravention of this Privacy Policy.
By way of clarification, CPNI comprises of: (i) information about the quantity, technical configuration, type, destination, location, and extent to which you use our communication-related services; and (ii) information contained on your telephone bill concerning the services you receive. That information, when matched to your name, address, and telephone number, is known as CPNI. Examples of CPNI include information typically available from telephone-related details on your monthly bill, technical information, type of service, current telephone charges, long distance and local service billing records, directory assistance charges, usage data, and calling patterns. CPNI does not include subscriber list information, aggregate information, or data not specific to a single customer.
You may examine and correct, if necessary, the CPNI-related personally identifiable information regarding you that is collected and maintained by us in our regular business records. In most cases, this information consists solely of billing and account information. We will correct our records if you make a reasonable showing that any such information we have collected about you is inaccurate. If you wish to examine these records, please contact us in writing at the address listed below. Please give us a reasonable period of time to locate and, if necessary, prepare the information for your review. You will only be permitted to examine records that contain personally identifiable information about your account and no other account.
You have the right to restrict our use of your CPNI by sending a request in writing to: inContact, Inc., Kimm Partridge, Assistant Corporate Secretary, 75 West Towne Ridge Parkway, Tower 1, Sandy, UT 84070. If you deny or restrict your approval for inContact to use your CPNI, you will suffer no effect, now or in the future, on the services provided to you other than our ability to provide you with, or otherwise notify you of, the customized offerings and enhanced services described above.
In the event inContact experiences a privacy breach and CPNI is disclosed to unauthorized persons, federal rules require that such breach be reported to law enforcement. Please be aware that we are not permitted by law to inform customers of the CPNI breach until at least seven (7) days after notification has been sent to law enforcement (which period may be extended if law enforcement shall advise us to withhold such information for a longer period of time).
DATA SECURITY
inContact implements data security systems and procedures to secure the information stored on inContact computer servers. Such systems and procedures reduce the risk of security breaches, but they do not provide absolute security. Therefore, inContact cannot guarantee that the Services are immune to unauthorized access to the information stored therein and to other information security risks.
ACCESS TO PERSONAL INFORMATION
If your information changes, or if you no longer desire to use and access our Services, you may correct, update, or delete/deactivate your information by contacting us as defined in your service contract. inContact accepts requests for information where we are an information processor only from the applicable information controller. We will undertake to respond to your request within 30 days of inContact’s receipt thereof. inContact will make reasonable efforts to accommodate your requests.
We will retain your information for as long as required to provide you Services. We will also retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and to enforce our agreements.

Changes will take effect once they are posted online and by accessing and/or using the Services after we make any such changes to this Privacy Policy, you are deemed to have accepted such changes. If you do not agree with any of the amended terms, you must avoid any further use of the Services offered by inContact.
