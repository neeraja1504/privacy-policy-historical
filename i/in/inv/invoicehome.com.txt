This Privacy Policy applies to Wikilane Services only. Some pages of our websites may contain external links. You should verify the privacy practices of such websites; third party application providers are governed by their own privacy policies.
Personal & Financial Information
We understand your need for online privacy and therefore take the appropriate measures to protect any personal or financial information you may share with us.
When you create a user account, we may ask for your name, company name, billing address and email address. If you sign up for Services requiring payment, we may ask for your credit card or other payment account information.
