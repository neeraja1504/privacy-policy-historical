HOW DOES THE COMPANY PROTECT MY PERSONAL INFORMATION?
SECURITY MEASURES & SAFEGUARDS
The security of our users' information is very important to us. When users submit personal information via the Services, that information is protected by generally accepted industry standards, and in accordance with applicable data privacy laws, including both online and off-line security measures and safeguards. The Company uses a combination of administrative, technical, personnel, and physical measures to safeguard personal information in its possession against loss, theft, and unauthorized use, disclosure, or modification. However, no one can guarantee the complete safety of your information. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us of the problem.  However, please remember that no method of electronic storage or transmission over the internet is one-hundred percent secure and therefore, while we strive to use commercially reasonable means to protect your personal information, and will comply with applicable data privacy laws, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of such information.
PHISHING
Phishing is a term used to describe a type of internet scam in which inauthentic emails that appear to be coming from a legitimate source are sent in an attempt to trick you into providing confidential information. These emails usually invoke a sense of urgency and often imply that your account is about to be closed unless immediate action is taken. They will often ask you to click on a link that leads you to a webpage that simulates that of the legitimate source, but it is really a page specially designed to get you to input your confidential information such as account number, password, social security number, or credit card number. The thieves then use that information to commit fraud and identity theft against you.
The Office of the Comptroller of Currency has set up a website providing information warning consumers about the dangers of these scams and how to protect yourself. To learn more about phishing, please click on the following link: www.occ.gov/consumer/phishing.htm.If you ever question the legitimacy of an email or other communication from IBD, please contact Customer Success at: 1-800-831-2525 or outside the United States at +1-310-448-6600. If you believe you have been the victim of a scam, you can file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission at: www.consumer.gov/idtheft/. If you have any additional questions about the security of our Services, you can contact IBD Customer Success online via https://askinvestorhelp.force.com/s/.

Where it is not possible to remove or delete all information, the Company shall continue to safeguard your information as detailed herein.

NEVADA CONSUMER RIGHTS UNDER NEVADA'S SB-220
This section of the Policy details Nevada consumers' rights under Nevada Senate Bill 220 (" SB-220 "). If you are a Nevada " consumer " (as defined under SB-220), the purpose of this section is to briefly describe: 1) your rights under SB-220; and 2) describe how you may make a request for those rights to be enforced.
RIGHT TO OPT-OUT OF THE SALE OF COVERED INFORMATION
SB-220 grants Nevada-based consumers the right to opt-out of the " sale " of their " covered information " by web " operators " to another person in exchange for monetary consideration. SB-220 defines a " consumer " as a person who seeks or acquires, by purchase or lease, any good, service, money or credit for personal, family or household purposes from the Internet website or online service of an operator. Under SB-220, " sale " means the exchange of covered information for monetary consideration by the operator to a person for the person to license or sell the covered information to additional persons. The definition of "sale" under SB-220 does not include disclosures of covered information:
To a person who processes the covered information on behalf of the operator;
To a person with whom the consumer has a direct relationship for the purposes of providing a product or service requested by the consumer;
To a person for purposes which are consistent with the reasonable expectations of a consumer considering the context in which the consumer provided the covered information to the operator;
To a person who is an affiliate of the operator; or
To a person as an asset that is part of a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy or other transaction in which the person assumes control of all or part of the assets of the operator.
If you are a Nevada consumer and wish to exercise your rights related to SB-220, please call IBD's Customer Success Team at 1-800-831-2525. Please note that if we receive a request from you to exercise your rights, the Company has the right to have you take reasonable steps to confirm your identity. The Company is not obligated to, and will not, give effect to data subject rights unless the Company can reasonably verify that the request is a " verified request " (as defined under SB-220).
