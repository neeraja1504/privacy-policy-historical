Information We Collect and How We Use It
Voluntary Information Provided by You : Our websites collect certain personal information about you whenever you voluntarily provide it, such as when you complete one of our online forms to request information about our products or services, to register for one of our seminars, or to arrange a one-on-one tour of our Investor Toolboxâ„¢. The personal information you provide can include such items as your name, company, e-mail and US mail addresses, and your telephone and fax numbers.
We use this information provided by you to provide the information you request, register you for one of our introductory classes, or to contact you for the purpose you requested. If you check the box that you would like to be notified about upcoming events or special offers from Investools, then we will also send you this information.

If you join an e-mail list, you will be sent by e-mail certain updates and news relevant to the subject matter you requested. If at any time you no longer wish to receive these e-mails, instructions on how to unsubscribe from the e-mail list are set forth at the bottom of each e-mail.
We do not sell or provide this personal information to third parties for their use. We may disclose your personal information to our vendors who provide services on our behalf, including marketing services.
We reserve the right to disclose personal information in limited circumstances where we believe in good faith that disclosure is required by law, to comply with valid legal processes such as a search warrant, subpoena, or court order, to comply with regulators or law enforcement authorities, or to protect our rights and property.
