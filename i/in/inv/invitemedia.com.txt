Invite Media - Next generation platform for display media trading
Effective: September 1, 2011
Invite Media (“we” or “us”), headquartered in the United States, is an online advertising and technology company. We provide this privacy policy so that we may inform you about how our technology (“Technology”), based on Bid Manager™, processes information on behalf of online advertisers, website owners and other businesses that use our services (our “Clients”). This policy also outlines our privacy practices on our corporate Website (“Website”), www.invitemedia.com.
If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please feel free to contact us at privacy@invitemedia.com.
Privacy Practices for our Technology
WHAT DOES INVITE MEDIA DO?
Invite Media runs a platform that allows our clients to buy or sell ad space on websites for online advertising. Our clients are businesses engaged in Internet advertising - advertisers, publishers, ad networks or ad agencies. Our clients buy and sell media by participating in online exchanges for ad space. Our Bid Manager technology powers this platform. When ad space on a website is bought or sold, usually to an advertiser, ad agency or ad network by a publisher, the Bid Manager technology, as an agent for its clients, fulfills the transaction by delivering the ad to the Internet user who visits that site. Generally, an Internet user's computer comes into contact with Invite Media when a user visits a website, or views an ad, powered by the Bid Manager technology. The ads sent by the Bid Manager technology are sent from the domain invitemedia.com, sometimes through client domains that forward ads and ad requests to and from invitemedia.com.

Non-Personally Identifiable Information
We collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information (“Non-PII”) via our Technology, including but not limited to your IP host address, the date and time of the ad request, pages viewed, browser type, the referring URL, Internet Service Provider, and your computer's operating system.

What are cookies?
Cookies are small text files that web servers typically send to users’ computer when they visit a website. Cookies are stored as text files on users’ hard drive, and can be accessed by web servers when the user returns to a website or goes to another website. Cookies are used by companies to collect and send information about a user’s website visit – for example, number of visits, average time spent, pages viewed, navigation history through the website, and other statistics. This information helps companies improve a user’s online experience in many ways: for example, by allowing companies to monitor website performance, make the website easier to use, measure the effectiveness of their promotional placements, and tailor their website to better match a user’s interests and preferences. Cookies cannot be used to access any other data on a user’s hard drive, or to personally identify them. Users who prefer not to accept cookies can set their Internet browser to notify them when they receive a cookie or to prevent cookies from being placed on their hard drive.
HOW IS OUR INFORMATION SECURED AND PROTECTED?
All of the user data collected by Invite Media is stored only in anonymous form, meaning that information about a specific user cannot be retrieved. Even so, we maintain physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards to protect all our data from accidental, unauthorized or unlawful access, use, modification, disclosure, loss, or destruction. The data is kept on a secure server and we restrict access to the data solely to authorized users. No security measures, however thorough, are perfect and there can be no absolute assurance of security and therefore, we cannot and do not offer an absolute guarantee or warrant the security of the information we possess.
INFORMATION STORAGE AND SECURITY
Storage of Non-PII
We retain the Non-PII collected via our Technology for up to 180 days in order to ensure that our Technology is functioning properly. After 180 days, we render this information anonymous and store it for up to three years.
Information Security
The security of your information is important to us. We have implemented reasonable security measures to protect the information in our care, both during transmission and once we receive it. This includes, but is not limited to the use of encryption. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
If you have any questions about our security practices, please send an email to us at privacy@invitemedia.com
