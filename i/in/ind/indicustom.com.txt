indi - Privacy Statement
SUMMARY
At indi we take your privacy very seriously. Please read this Privacy Policy to learn more about how we treat personally identifiable and other information. We provide this Privacy Policy because you have a right to know what information we collect, how it is protected and used, and the circumstances under which it may be disclosed. If you have comments, suggestions, questions, or concerns about our Privacy Policy, please contact us via email at , or in writing at: Attention: Management, indi, 5515 Doyle Street, Suite #15, Emeryville, CA 94608.
Online Privacy Standards. While there are no official standards governing privacy practices on the internet, we follow the principles supported by the Federal Trade Commission’s Fair Information Practices Principles, currently available at
http://www.ftc.gov/reports/privacy3/fairinfo.htm.
What This Privacy Policy Covers. This Privacy Policy covers indi’s treatment of personally identifiable that we obtain when you visit www.indiCustom.com (the "Site"), elect to receive promotional materials, or register an account. We regard personally identifiable information as information that can be used to identify or contact you in person, such as real name, telephone number, email address, physical mailing address, and body measurements.
What This Privacy Policy Does Not Cover. From time to time, our Site will link to websites that are controlled by third parties. This statement does not cover the privacy practices of third parties that we do not own or control, such as our partners and advertisers, nor does it cover the privacy practices of third parties through which Content and Comments (defined below) can be shared, such as Digg, Facebook, and the like. All of these external sites operate independently of indi and they each have their own privacy or security practices. For your best online experience, we encourage you to review their policies before submitting any personal information to them. If you do provide information to a retailer or other business featured by indi, any transaction that may result will occur through that company’s website and not our own website. indi acts solely as the facilitator of that transaction and does not control, and is not responsible for, the privacy practices of those other businesses. We encourage you to seek information about safeguarding your online privacy from experts such as the Federal Trade Commission.
HOW INFORMATION IS COLLECTED
1. Information You Provide.
Required Registration Information. During the process of registering an account (your “account profile”), we will collect your first and last name, email address, and ask you to select a password. Your email address will also serve to identify your account profile in our system and you will use your email address to login to your account.
Body Measurements. During the process of creating your custom order, we also collect information reflecting your body measurements, body shape and sizes typically purchased. This information is necessary so that we can customize the fit of your garment. This information is stored in our database and cannot be edited from within your account profile. To make adjustments to a garment you have previously ordered, please use our re-order tool. Read our re-order FAQ to learn more.
Information Submitted During A Transaction. . During a payment transaction we collect information including your name, shipping and billing address(es), email address, and telephone number. This information is collected and used to process your payment transaction, and also for shipping your apparel to you. The shipping address you provide during a payment transaction will be stored in your account profile.
indi does not itself collect any financial information from you. Instead, your transactions are handled through Authorize.Net. The Site allows you to use Authorize.Net to conveniently make payments online using a credit card. Before using Authorize.Net, indi strongly suggests that you review Authorize.Net's own privacy policy, which is available online at the Authorize.Net website www.authorize.net.
Comments. When commenting on custom designs created by users of the Site ("Comments"), the free-form textbox in which Comments may be made can be used to enter any text – including personally identifiable information. Such information will be visible to all users of the Site who view Comments for that garment. For this reason, you should only include information in your Comments that you wish to share with the public.
2. Information We Do Not Collect.
Children. As explained further in our Terms of Use, available at www.inditailored.com/terms, you must be eighteen (18) years of age or older to use the Site. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from or about children. If you believe that we have information from or about anyone under 13 years of age, please notify us by email at  or write to us at the address noted above in the first paragraph of this Privacy Policy.
Social Security Number. We do not ask for or require you to provide your social security number to use any of our services or to access any part of our Site.
Birth Date. We do not ask for or require you to reveal your birth date to use any of our services or to access any part of our Site.
3. Information We Track.
Log Files. Similar to many websites, we gather certain anonymous, non-personal information automatically and store it in web server log files when you visit our Site, including when you create an account profile, sign-in, search, fill out a survey, or request our e-mail newsletter. This information includes internet protocol addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), site entry/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to improve the Site, analyze trends, administer the Site, track users’ movements around the Site, address security issues, and gather aggregate information about our user base as a whole. Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of services or account profile holders from which individual member identities have been removed, and therefore does not include your personally identifiable information.
Cookies. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. It can also help us understand how our site visitors click to our site, and what pages they view during their visit. Similar to many websites, we store an encrypted cookie on your computer so we can remember you when you come back to our website without requiring you to log-in every time. Cookies also allow us to track and understand the interests of our users to enhance the overall experience on our site.
You can set your web browser software to disable cookies. To do so, please refer to the help section of your specific browser for more information on how to manage or disable cookies. If you disable cookies, you may still view our site, but some areas of our site may not work properly.
