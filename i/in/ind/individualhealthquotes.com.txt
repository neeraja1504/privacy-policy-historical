California residents privacy rights
Companies that collect personally-identifiable information from California residents and disclose such information to Third Parties (including affiliated entities) for marketing purposes must, in response to a request by a consumer, either (1) provide a list detailing the categories of information shared and the entities to which such information was provided, or (2) provide a mechanism by which a consumer may opt-out of having their information shared with Third Parties.
GoHealth has elected the first option, and you may request a list detailing (1) what information was shared and (2) the entities to which GoHealth directly shared that information. You may request this list by sending your request, including your full name, email address, and postal address to:
