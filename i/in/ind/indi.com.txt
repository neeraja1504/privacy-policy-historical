What information does Indi collect from you? In order to better provide you with the services offered on the Indi site, Indi collects two types of information about its visitors: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information. Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience while using our site. Personally Identifiable Information This refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are. Personal information is requested in many ways, for example, when you register and set up an account, post on the Indi site, register for a product or service, enter challenges or sweepstakes, apply for a credit card, fill out surveys, and send us feedback. For example, this information might include your name, billing address, shipping address, Face Book ID, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card or other payment information, and product details. With this information, Indi can better provide you with personalized services. For some third party services, we may collect your personal information on behalf of these service providers and share it with them. Non-Personally Identifiable Information This refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual. We gather certain information about you based upon where you visit on, and how you use, our site in several ways. This information is compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis. For example, this information may include gender, geographic location, genres, categories and channels you interact with, the Web site's Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") that you just came from, which URL you next go to, what browser you are using, cookies, device information, your Internet Protocol ("IP") address and NPII third party information passed to us from your third party registration on Indi (e.g., from Face Book login). A URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web. An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol ("TCP/IP") network, such as the World Wide Web. Networks like the Web use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address of the destination. In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the web, allowing web servers to locate and identify your computer. Computers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet, browse and shop. On an aggregated basis, we collect anonymous data related to the pages, posts, communications, products, downloads and other content that is sampled, clicked on, streamed, searched for, transferred from and downloaded. When content on Indi is shared into social media, that content may be tagged and tracked in social media for primary purposes of Buzz determination, and the social media site may pass back certain information such as likes, shares, comments and other interactions that such content receives within the social media network. Except as otherwise limited in this Policy, we may disclose, share, sell, trade, or rent Non-Personally Identifiable Information to others without your consent.
Where do we collect information from you and how do we use it? Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide Indi's visitors with a superior customized online experience. We use the customer contact information in many ways, including without limitation to communicate with customers, to inform them of their challenge status, to send promotional information, and to enhance the operation of our site and administer our systems. Demographic data also may be collected at our site from third party log-in services, advertising servers, content servers, or web site analysis agents who provide us with the zip code and area code associated with a visitor's server, along with pages viewed on our site. We review the actions of the Indi visitors on to determine customers' preferences. Indi also does research on our visitors' demographics, postings, interests, and pages viewed based on the information provided to us during content uploading, challenges, posting comments and reviews, a promotion, from our server log files, from our web site analysis agents, or from challenges, drawings, postings or surveys. We will use this data to tailor the visitor's experience at our site, to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze site use, to improve our product and services offerings, and to customize our site's content, layout, and services. We receive reports from third party ad servers, content servers, or web site analysis agents that tells us how many ads were presented and clicked upon or what content was served or viewed. We may also share your personally identifiable information with third parties who provide services to us, our customers and web site visitors. Those third parties include authorized contractors, temporary employees and consultants and other companies working with us (collectively, "agents"). Where we believe it to be appropriate (in our sole discretion), we will ask our agents not to disclose or use your personal information for purposes other than to provide services to you or Indi. We gather information in the following ways: Use of the Site and Services Generally We collect IP addresses, cookies and device and usage for the purposes of system administration, and gather broad demographic information, to enable ads to be served on our site and generally to report Non-Personally Identifiable Information to our advertisers and channel owners on Indi whose channel you have visited, and to monitor the level of activity on our site.

We also track customers' traffic patterns throughout their online session, including which pages, information and advertisements a customer views while using the site, content posting, communications and all other use of the Indi site.

We may share aggregated statistics about pages viewed on our site, sales and other shopping information with third parties.

When content on Indi is shared into social media, that content may be tagged and tracked in social media for the primary purposes of Buzz determination, and the social media site may pass back certain information such as likes, shares, comments and other interactions that such content receives within the social media network. All of the foregoing Non-Personally Identifiable Information is shared with channel owners on Indi with respect to your visits on their channels, and Personally Identifiable Information may be transferred to a channel owner based on your agreement to share such information when uploading to a forum or challenge on the channel owners channel.

Our ad server, content servers and website analysis agents may use action tags to count the number of times that visitors click on a particular banner ad or visit the pages of our site and to provide information about what products are viewed or purchased. Without collecting any personally identifiable information, they use that data to tell us (and other advertisers) which ads are the most effective on particular sites.
