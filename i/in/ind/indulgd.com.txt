Indulgd.com respects each individual user’s right to privacy. Indulgd.com and its site does not collect personal identifying information unless such information is specifically and knowingly provided from users during contests, surveys, sweepstakes, giveaways, site registration, or use of public areas, such as a forum.

Indulgd.com does not supply identifying information to other companies, or uses such information for its own purposes including but not limited to email newsletters, unless the user “opts-in” for such purposes by specifically allowing usage. (Identifying information must necessarily be used when notifying a user of requested information, such as notification of a winning entry in a contest or sweepstakes.) Indulgd.com is not responsible for any actions or policies of such companies.
Indulgd.com uses reasonable precautions to keep the personal information disclosed to us secure. However, Indulgd.com is not responsible for any breach of security.

Such activities are beyond the control of Indulgd.com.
