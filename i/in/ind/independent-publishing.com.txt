Data Collection
Your personal data will be stored, processed and used only with your express consent. Your registration on our website constitutes your consent to such collection and processing of data.
Each time you access the website as an author or a customer, some technical information such as your computer's IP address, your internet browser, your operating system and the query domain name, as well as the time and date of connection, will be automatically registered and recorded. This information may be used for statistical purposes, but it will not be associated with your personal details in any way.
Data Usage
We will use your personal data, should you provide it, solely for purposes of electronic communication, unwinding a terminated contract, processing orders, and other internal administrative activities.
We do not send newsletters or questionnaires to our users without their permission.
Data Transfers to Third Parties
Your personal data is collected for internal use only and will not be transferred to third parties without your consent. We apply the highest possible security standards as part of our efforts to protect your data and make it inaccessible to third parties. However, complete security cannot generally be guaranteed when communicating via basic email.
We nonetheless reserve the right to share your data if required to do so by law (e.g. in response to duly authorized information requests of police and governmental authorities).
Modification and deletion of data
You have the absolute right to obtain information about the data that is held about you, specifically the origin, destination and the purpose behind the storage of your personal details. Needless to say, you are free to withdraw your consent to the storage of personal data at any time. In such cases, any stored personal data will be immediately deleted.
