Personally identifiable information is information that relates to and can be identified with a unique individual person.

We may make these requests through surveys or other methods. Your response to these requests is optional. While we require these service-related companies to take steps to maintain the confidentiality of any personally identifiable information they may receive from you to perform these functions, consistent with our Privacy Policy, you should also review the privacy policies of these service providers to understand how they handle this information.
Certain downloadable software applications and applets that we offer may transmit data to us. We may not make a formal disclosure if we believe our collection and use of the information is obvious for purposes of your use of such application. If we believe it is not obvious that we are collecting or using such information, we will make a disclosure to you the first time you provide the information to us so that you can decide whether you want to use that feature.
Information Collected Automatically
When you visit this Site, like when you visit most other websites, certain anonymous information about your visit is automatically logged, including the server name, browser type and IP address through which you access the internet, the date and time you access our site, the pages you access while at this Site, and the internet address of the website, if any, from which you linked directly to this Site, which we sometimes aggregate with similar information from other customers to help improve or promote our service.
“Cookies” — A cookie is a small piece of data stored on the user’s computer tied to information about the user. We use session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID cookie terminates when you close your browser. A persistent cookie is stored for an extended period of time. Cookies allow us to recognize your computer while you are on this Site and when you return to this Site and help customize your online experience and make it more convenient for you. Cookies are also useful in tracking transaction histories and preserving information between sessions. The information collected from cookies may also be used to improve the functionality of this Site. Most web browser applications (such as Google Chrome and Firefox) have features that can notify you when you receive a cookie or prevent cookies from being sent. If you disable cookies, you may not be able to use certain personalized functions of this website.
Clear GIFs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs) — We employ a software technology called clear GIFs (sometimes called web beacons or web bugs), to learn what content users find effective. Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of users. We may tie information collected through the use of Clear GIFs to users’ personally identifiable information.
Clear GIFs can “work with” existing cookies on a computer if they are both from the same web site. For example, clear GIFs enable us to match the Clear GIF identifier with a cookie ID number to show the past online behavior for a particular computer.
In addition, we use clear GIFs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by the recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.
Information from Other Sources – We may receive information about you from other sources, such as data compiled from our marketing partners (e.g. how you responded to an ad or other sponsored content (e.g. articles)), or data from social media sites.
