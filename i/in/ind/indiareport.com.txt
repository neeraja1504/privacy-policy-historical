**Children's Guidelines: The Learning Network  **
The Learning Network is a free service for parents, teachers and students, and does not require registration. The Student Connections section is specifically directed at students, grades 6 to 12; within this section, the Ask Indiareport.com allows students to send a question to Indiareport.com providing their first name, grade, school and state/country and optionally their e-mail address. The information requested on these pages is used solely for participation in these activities, and is not shared or sold to third parties. Access to the above services is not conditioned on more information than is reasonably necessary to provide the services. Because we're concerned about a Parent's right to consent to the collection and use of their child's personal information, when a question is published, only the student's first name, grade, and state/country appear on the site. To request removal of this information (non-personally identifiable) or to review or remove the optional e-mail address (personal information collected), please use this form to contact the Learning Network.
These Childrens' guidelines have been developed with the recognition that Internet technologies are rapidly evolving, and that underlying business models are still not established. Accordingly, guidelines are subject to change. In the unlikely event of such changes they will be posted on this page. If the changes represent a material departure from our current practices with respect to the use of children's personal information, the changes will be posted on this page thirty days prior to taking effect and will not affect children's personal information previously collected. __
