Privacy - Index Exchange
Last Updated : February 22, 2019
Index Exchange, Inc. (“Index Exchange”) believes in all Internet users’ rights to privacy. This Policy explains the information collection, use, and disclosure practices of Index Exchange. It applies to all information received by Index Exchange whether in electronic, paper or verbal format.
THE INDEX EXCHANGE BUSINESS
The Index Exchange Online Advertising Exchange (“Index Platform”) prides itself on providing an atmosphere that is non-disruptive to Internet users. Our proprietary ad personalizationmethodologies enable advertisers to effectively direct their campaigns to the audience(s) they are looking to reach without engaging in profiling practices. Services offered by Index Exchange include a Web-based advertising exchange marketplace that enables publishers, advertisers, and ad networks to efficiently market, buy and sell digital and mobile advertising and ad inventory.
Through its ad server, Index Exchange also acts as a service provider to enable its publishers, advertisers, ad networks and other clients to collect and use data for advertising purposes on their digital and mobile platforms across the Internet.  Publishers may use our services to process consumer data, which they collect or source. Their data collection, use, and sharing practices may be governed by their own privacy policies and differ from those found in Index Exchange’s Privacy Policy. We encourage you to refer to the privacy policies of any websites you visit and apps you use, to learn about their privacy practices before disclosing any personal information to them.
** INDUSTRY SELF – ** REGULATION
Index Exchange prides itself on conducting business in a transparent and open manner. In line with those values, we support efforts for self-regulation in the internet-based advertising industry.
NAI
Index Exchange is a member in good standing of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI), a cooperative of online marketing and analytics companies committed to responsible data collection for digital advertising, building consumer awareness, and establishing responsible business and data management practices and standards. Index Exchange adheres to the NAI Code of Conduct in all its operations.
DAA
Index Exchange adheres to the standards and practices outlined by The Digital Advertising Alliance, a consortium of the leading national advertising and marketing trade associations, promoting a self-regulatory program for online interest-based advertising. More information on the program can be found here.
** INFORMATION COLLECTION , USE , AND SHARING**
In general, like most standard website servers, Index Exchange uses log files to track transactions. These log files include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser types used, postal or zip codes, the internet service provider (ISP) utilised, referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamps, device IDs, and number of clicks among others. This information is then used to analyze trends, administer the site, and personalizeadvertisements to users accordingly. Index Exchange does not collect a website user’s Personally Identifiable Information (PII) as defined under United States federal law. However, in the course of and for purposes of conducting its business, Index Exchange may collect and process the following consumer information that is considered Personal Information (PI)  under the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) or Personal Data under the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR):
(1) browser and device information received from publishers is shared with advertisers and agencies for responding to requests for advertisements, forecast advertising inventory and troubleshooting any operation issues related to the Index Platform;
(2) IP addresses, including both IPv4 and IPv6 are used to bid on advertising inventory;
(3) geo-location data is used to bid on advertising inventory;
(4) Precise Location Data (data obtained from a device about the physical location of the device) is used to bid on advertising inventory;
(5) GPS coordinates, where available;
(6) unique Index Exchange UserIDs, stored in browser cookies, are used for profiles on the ad server;
(7) mobile device identifiers are used to understand mobile traffic and are shared with advertisers and agencies to personalize the advertising experience;
(8) Pixel Data (data obtained through or in connection with the placement of any pixel mechanism) is used as part of the user matching process;
(9) people identifiers provided by Index Exchange’s partners are associated to audience segments, and shared with advertisers and agencies;
(10) data on whether a user viewed or clicked on an Ad is shared with advertisers and agencies.
Index Exchange’s internal processes treat personal data in accordance with regulatory requirements and applicable privacy laws to ensure that information is stored securely and used only for allowed and intended purposes.
Index Exchange may combine information that does not directly identify an individual with data collected from other sources to provide publishers, advertisers and ad networks with information to improve the relevance of advertising presented to users and determine whether to bid on ad inventory. In addition, although Index Exchange does not directly engage in Cross-App Advertising, our technology may collect and/or pass through Mobile Device IDs (the unique identifier assigned to a device by the manufacturer) or Advertising IDs (for iOS 6 and later), instead of cookies, to recognize you.
** Do Not Track Signal**
Index Exchange does not honor the ‘DNT’ browser signal. Instead, we utilize the cookie based opt-out mechanisms to allow users to opt-out of all advertising. For more information, please see the “Your Choices” section below.
Cross – ** Device _Linking**_
Cross-Device Linking is the process of making assumptions that certain devices are related to each other, i.e. they belong to the same user/household. Index Exchange may engage in Cross Device Linking for personalized advertising, ad delivery, and reporting. If you would like to opt-out of having Cross-Device Linking used by Index Exchange on your devices, please see the “Your Choices” section below.
Cookies ( _ HTTP Cookies and HTML5 Cookies or Local Storage_ )
An HTTP cookie is an object that stores a small amount of data on behalf of a browser on a given device.  By saving information in a cookie, websites can remember preferences or recognize browsers from one visit to another or from one website to another. Index Exchange uses both session-only and persistent cookies. More specifically, Index Exchange uses certain cookies that last only for the duration of a user’s internet session and expire when that user closes his or her browser, as well as certain other cookies that are used to remember a user when he or she returns to a website and will last for longer.
HTML5 cookies, also known as HTML5 Web Storage, or local storage, is a technology that allows a website or application to store information locally on a user’s computer or mobile device. Index Exchange uses HTML5 cookies, or local storage, in connection with its platform and website to support publisher monetization objectives and speed up page load time.
Index Exchange ultimately uses these technologies (referred to as “cookies” going forward)  to facilitate transactions between buyers and sellers of digital advertising inventory and, among other things, to enable its demand-side partners, publishers, data management platforms, and other third-party clients (collectively referred to as “Index Exchange clients/partners” moving forward) to effectively: (a) target advertisements to users of digital media properties, (b) evaluate and assess their advertisements and campaigns; and (c) view and enforce user opt-out choices. Index Exchange’s platform further uses cookies to associate information that does not directly identify an individual user with browsers and devices, so that Index Exchange’s platform and Index Exchange clients/partners can then use the information to select advertisements and campaigns for delivery via the Index Exchange platform. Index Exchange engages in cookie syncing, which is the matching of Index Exchange cookie IDs to Index Exchange clients’/partners’ cookie IDs.
Index Exchange collects and stores IDs from a variety of domains, including adsrvr.org and casalemedia.com. These IDs are stored in either Index Exchange’s domain (casalemedia.com) or the publisher’s first party domain.
PII , PI , and Personal Data of Index Exchange Clients
Registering to become a member of the Index Platform and use of the Index Exchange User Interface, either as an advertiser or a publisher, requires the submission of PI, PII or Personal Data to Index Exchange. This can include the full name, mailing and/or billing address, email address, company name, and website URL. Index Exchange uses this information to service its accounts and respond to inbound inquiries related to sales or technical support requests. Communications to business users are related to the Advertising Exchange. The Index Exchange User Interface also uses Google Analytics technology to monitor traffic on the UI. All such information submitted is held by Index Exchange in strict confidence and as prescribed by corresponding regulatory authorities.
Index Exchange does not engage in any form of distribution or sale of PII, PI or Personal Data to third parties for their own promotional use. Index Exchange does not sell, supply, or otherwise make user PII, PI or Personal Data available to any third party under any circumstances, unless ordered to do so by a court of competent jurisdiction.
Information Obtained from Third Parties
Index Exchange may obtain data from third party companies for the purpose of informing ad selection. This data may include Personal Data as defined under the GDPR. Advertisers who are clients of Index Exchange may collect PII and Personal Data on their own websites. These details are provided directly by the individual Internet user through online order forms, contests, etc. PII or Personal Data provided through an advertiser’s website is not visible to Index Exchange while being entered, nor provided to Index Exchange at any time in the future. This personal data collected by the advertiser is subject to the privacy policy of the individual advertiser involved.
YOUR PRIVACY CHOICES
Web Browser Option to Opt – Out
Some of the ads you see on the internet or in applications on your mobile device are tailored to your interests and based on your activity online or in the applications on your mobile device. This type of ad tailoring — sometimes called “interest-based” advertising — is enabled through various technologies, including browser cookies, mobile advertising identifiers as well as other non-cookie technologies. Tailored digital ads help support the free products, services and content you enjoy online. To help protect your privacy, Index Exchange (along with other NAI members) has voluntarily agreed to abide by high NAI standards including offering an opt-out mechanism.
Opting out of interest-based advertising means that you will no longer be shown ads that have been tailored to your interests. It does not mean you will no longer see advertising online. When you opt-out, an opt-out cookie will be stored in your web browser signaling your opt-out preference to NAI members including Index Exchange.
Please note that if your browser is configured to block third-party cookies, then the opt out cookie may not work. If you delete your browser cookies, you will need to opt out again. The opt-out will not apply to the specific browser in which you set it. The opt-out process must be repeated for each different browser.
