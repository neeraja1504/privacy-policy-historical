If you have any questions, comments or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us at privacy@industrybrains.com Please familiarize yourself with the policies that are applicable to you.
IndustryBrains Privacy Policy
IndustryBrains Advertisers
If an individual or business chooses to sign up as an advertiser on the IndustryBrains Premium Advertising Network, they are explicitly agreeing to the use of information they provide as described below. The nature of this technology means that advertisers who do not agree with this policy cannot use the IndustryBrains Premium Advertising Network, advertising interface or measurement tools. The Terms and Conditions that they agree to during registration allow IndustryBrains to update the terms of this privacy policy at any time and without notice. It is an Advertiser's responsibility to review this privacy policy prior to logging in. Use of IndustryBrains is conditioned on advertiserâ€™s acceptance without modification of the terms, conditions, and notices contained herein. Use of the IndustryBrains Premium Advertising Network constitutes your agreement to all such terms, conditions, and notices.
Personal information provided by an advertiser will be combined with information about its purchasing patterns of IndustryBrains's products and services, performance of its advertisements, and all other information provided by the advertiser. IndustryBrains regularly shares this information with key partners on an individual basis. Furthermore, IndustryBrains and its partners may use this information to contact the advertiser about additional products and services.
An advertiser has the right to terminate their relationship with IndustryBrains in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the advertiser's contract with IndustryBrains. However, all information captured about the advertiser will remain the property of IndustryBrains indefinitely.
IndustryBrains AdNetwork Privacy Policy
Ad Serving
IndustryBrains partners with numerous companies to provide online advertisements to "End Users" which are human users across various websites on the internet. As an End User browses the web, he or she may visit web-pages that include references to IndustryBrains's advertising service. When this happens, an End User's browser may request advertisements from IndustryBrains's system.
When IndustryBrains receives these requests from non-European Union (EU) countries, we may record information about this interaction (as well as any further interaction with our advertisements such as clicks, mouse movements, etc.) including the End User's IP address and time of request, information about the general geographical location from which an End User is viewing an advertisement and other information made available by the browser. For EU countries, IndustryBrains does not store any personally identifiable information, makes no attempt to identify anyone personally, and does not target any ads based on any of these factors.
Additionally, IndustryBrains employs small text files stored on your web browser (otherwise known as cookies) for the purpose of better tailoring advertisements to an End User's preferences over time. These cookies may include a unique anonymous identifier along with information about the particular types of content in which the End User has shown interest.
On occasion, partner sites, vendors or internally run surveys may provide us with additional information about End Users. In these situations, all information is kept entirely anonymous and does not include any type of personally identifiable information. IndustryBrains only accepts this information from organizations with clearly available and visible privacy policies.
IndustryBrains does not sell information it collects about End Users. However, IndustryBrains may share data about aggregate usage statistics with the public or other businesses with whom we work.
The capture, storage and analysis of information are solely for the purposes of ensuring a positive End User experience, eliminating fraudulent activity, and system administration.
Organizations We Work With
IndustryBrains provides access to organizations we work with on IndustryBrains's Premium Advertising Network to manage their own advertising networks. Those relationships are managed under contracts between IndustryBrains and the respective partners. The campaign management tools which IndustryBrains provides to many of its partners allow each such partner to view all relevant information of IndustryBrains's advertisers whose ads are being displayed on that partner's site. Such information includes bidding data, spend data, topics and placements viewed and purchased.
