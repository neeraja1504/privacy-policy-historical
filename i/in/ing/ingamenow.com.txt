Privacy
InGameNow is a social media network for sports fans. The site lets people remain current with their favorite leagues, teams, and athletes utilizing relevant sports content submitted by other community members and other sources. To accomplish this, our users create their own profiles, which display some personal information to other members and visitors. This allows our users to identify each other and expand their personal network of contacts. InGameNow members can change their profile information at any time and can control how other members and the service communicates with them via the website, SMS, WAP and Instant Messaging ("Service").
InGameNow cares deeply about online privacy. If you have any questions concerning this privacy policy, please email us at info@ingamenow.com.
Information Collection and Use by InGameNow
InGameNow collects user submitted information such as name, email address, age, and other information to authenticate users and to send notifications to those users relating to the InGameNow service. InGameNow also collects other profile data including but not limited to: personal interests, gender, age, and geographical location in order to assist users in finding those topics of interest to the user and ease communication between community members.
InGameNow also logs non-personally-identifiable information including IP address, profile information, aggregate user data, cookie information, and browser type, from users and visitors to the site. This data is used to manage the website, track usage and improve the website services. This non-personally-identifiable information may be shared with third-parties to provide more relevant services and advertisements to members. User IP addresses are recorded for security and monitoring purposes. User Profile information including members' pictures, user names, and first names are displayed to people in order to facilitate user interaction in the InGameNow social networking community. Email addresses are used for the purposes of inviting new friends to join InGameNow, to add users to members' contacts networks, and to send notifications related to the service. With the exception of inviting friends, adding friends, and notifications, a user's email address is not shared or displayed to people within a user's personal network. Users within a personal network communicate on InGameNow with each other through the InGameNow service, without disclosing their email addresses. Users' full names are never directly revealed to other members. We may also use a user's email address to send updates, a newsletter, or news regarding the service, though users may choose not to receive email of this type. From time to time, InGameNow, or a partner, may sponsor a promotion, sweepstake or contest on InGameNow. Users may be asked to provide personal information including name, email address or home address or to answer questions in order to participate. We may transfer personal information to certain ad partners that you have explicitly requested to receive information from. It will be clear at the point of collection who is collecting the personal information and whose privacy statement will apply. Invitations and Other Communications to Non-members InGameNow members can invite friends to join the service by sending invitation emails via our automated invitation system. InGameNow stores the email addresses that members provide so that the respondents may be added to the friend's list of the member sending the invitations, and also to send reminders of the invitations. InGameNow does not sell these email addresses or use them to send any other communication besides invitations, invitation reminders (up to three (3) per email address). Recipients of invitations from InGameNow may contact InGameNow to request the removal of their information from our database.
You may prevent InGameNow email invitations and other messages from being sent to any email address you control by sending a single email with the subject "BLOCK INVITE" to info@inGameNow.com. Please note that the email must come from the account you wish to block.
