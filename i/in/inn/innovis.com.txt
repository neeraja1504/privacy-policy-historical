Personal Information
You may elect to share personal information with us by filling out the information on our Request Product Information page, such as name, email address, phone number, and any other personal information you choose to provide. We use information you send to us through the Request Product Information page to respond to your inquiries or comments.
If you are creating an Innovis Personal Account, submitting a Fraud & Active Duty Alert, ordering an Innovis Credit Report, or requesting a Security Freeze through our site, you may elect to provide personal information, such as your name, email address, phone number, address, date of birth, and Social Security Number in order for us to process your request.
If you order your Innovis Credit Report, you can create a personal account which will allow you to initiate a dispute on your report if you believe information is incomplete or inaccurate. By doing so, when you log in, you have the option of providing us with additional information during the online dispute which may be of a personal nature. Personal information you provide to us during the dispute process may be incorporated into our database and used on future reports. The additional information you provide to us is within your discretion and will be used for the purpose of investigating your dispute. If you forget the password to your personal account, we may ask you to select a phone number to send a passcode. In this process, we use your name and phone number to detect possible fraudulent activity. Your phone number will be sent to Innovis vendors to determine whether the phone number or service has been recently manipulated, which prevents hackers from using your phone number to gain access to your account. Additionally, your phone number will be sent to a vendor that will deliver the passcode to your phone. This vendor has locations in the United States and one in the Netherlands, where your number will be stored at one of the locations for 90 days. In order to prevent fraudulent activity, your name and phone number captured during this password reset process are used to alert Innovis or its customers of frequent passcode requests to the same phone number and other patterns of a suspicious nature. This also helps protect you from identity thieves attempting to open or gain access to several accounts in your name.
