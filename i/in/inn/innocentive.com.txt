Privacy Policy | InnoCentive
InnoCentive respects and protects your data privacy rights. This statement includes InnoCentive’s European Union – U.S. Privacy Shield Notice and our Website Privacy and Cookie Statements.
EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Notice
Personal data gathered by InnoCentive may be processed in the United States. Data transferred in to the U.S. will be protected by adherence to our privacy policy as detailed on this page below. InnoCentive complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. InnoCentive has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view InnoCentive’s certification, please visit the Privacy Shield website.
If you are a resident of a European country participating in the Privacy Shield and you believe InnoCentive holds your personal data as specified in this Privacy Shield Statement, you may contact InnoCentive with questions or complaints concerning our Privacy Shield compliance using the contact information at the end of this document. If you have not received timely response to your concern, or we have not addressed your concern to your satisfaction, you may seek further assistance from EU Data Protection Authorities (DPA) under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework or the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner under the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. Our Privacy Shield compliance is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
You may also be able to invoke binding arbitration for unresolved complaints but prior to initiating such arbitration, a resident of a European country participating in the Privacy Shield must first: (1) contact us and afford us the opportunity to resolve the issue; (2) seek assistance from either the EU Data Protection Authorities or the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner; and (3) contact the U.S. Department of Commerce (either directly or through a European Data Protection Authority) and afford the Department of Commerce time to attempt to resolve the issue. If such a resident invokes binding arbitration, each party shall be responsible for its own attorney’s fees. Please be advised that, pursuant to the Privacy Shield, the arbitrator(s) may only impose individual-specific, non-monetary, equitable relief necessary to remedy any violation of the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to the resident.
If we transfer personal information received under the Privacy Shield to a third party, the third party’s access, use, and disclosure of the personal data must also be in compliance with our Privacy Shield obligations, and we will remain liable under the Privacy Shield for any failure to do so by the third party unless we prove we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. You may also limit the use of your data by setting your profile as private in the “Access Rights” section when editing your profile.
Users resident in certain countries have a legal right to access, modify, or remove their personal data we hold. Those users may exercise that right by contacting us using the methods listed at the end of this document.

We will use Your Information to respond to requests you may make of us, to communicate with you about InnoCentive Challenges, to communicate with you about InnoCentive services and products which might be of interest to you and from time to time, we may refer to Your Information to better understand your needs and how we can improve our websites, products and services.  You can choose whether you receive these communications as described below.
You may utilize social networking sites not operated by us. For example, you may be able to sign on to your InnoCentive account using a social networking site sign-on and connect through that social networking site to Your Information. Depending on the social networking site’s policies, we may collect certain information about you from your account on the social networking site (such as gender, age, occupation, hobbies, interests, zip code, contacts or other information you have provided to the social networking site) or about your activity on the social networking site.

Please remember that if you embed, post or link to Your Information on our Site on a social networking site’s page that is visible to the public, the terms of this Privacy Policy will not apply.
If you receive an Award in response to a Solution that you submit in response to an InnoCentive Challenge, we will request certain information from you in order to comply with our obligations under tax law and other applicable laws. This information will include copies of positive identification documentation and a tax identification number, often your Social Security number (“Award Information”). Award Information will not be incorporated into Your Information that is stored by the Site, and we will not request more Award Information than is reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations.

Cookies
Our Site uses “cookies”. Please refer to our Cookie Policy for more information about the types of cookies used on Our Site, and how you can manage cookies while on Our Site.
IP Addresses
Our Site uses Internet Protocol (IP) Addresses. An IP Address is a number assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider so you can access the Internet. Generally, an IP address changes each time you connect to the Internet (it is a “dynamic” address). Note, however, that if you have a broadband connection, depending on your individual circumstance, it is possible that your IP Address that we collect, or even perhaps a cookie we use, may contain information that could be deemed personally identifiable. This is because with some broadband connections, your IP Address doesn’t change — it is “static” — and could be associated with your personal computer. We use your IP address to report aggregate information on use and to help improve the Site.
