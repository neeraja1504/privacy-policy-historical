Privacy Policy | Inside Higher Ed
Inside Higher Ed values your privacy and promises to protect your personally identifiable information. The privacy policy below applies to all Inside Higher Ed sites and services. Some third-party service providers used by Inside Higher Ed may have their own privacy policies, and Inside Higher Ed is not responsible for their privacy policies or any other practices of these sites, it is always our intention to work with reputable providers who maintain views similar to ours regarding privacy. Below, we’ll detail the ways in which we may collect information about you and how that information is handled.
By continuing to utilize Inside Higher Ed sites or services or by submitting personal information to us, you are agreeing to the terms of this privacy policy and acknowledge that your information will be handled in accordance with this policy.
Information You Provide to Us
Account Creation
You only need to provide an email address to subscribe to Inside Higher Ed (create an “Account”). You have the option to provide additional data, such as your name, job title, organization, or geographic location, but you are not required to do so to receive email newsletters from us.
Other Information You Provide
If you are making a purchase or otherwise entering information on our site (including to apply to a job, comment on an article, or access specific content such as a booklet/survey or webcast), we may require information to help process your transaction. This might include but is not limited to: your name, email address, job title, organization, mailing address, phone number, credit card information or other information to help facilitate your experience or purchase. The only time we will ask for credit card information is when you are making a purchase on our site.
From time to time, Inside Higher Ed collects data from users via surveys or other forms of market research. This data may be shared with third parties, such as advertisers, but is done so in aggregate. The only time you will need to provide personally identifiable information is if you wish to enter a contest associated with a particular survey; in those cases, you will need to provide an email address, so we can contact you about your prize. Participation in any survey is completely voluntary.
Information You Authorize From Third-Party Services
We offer users the ability to create or access their Inside Higher Ed account via social login. This allows you to use an existing social networking account (such as LinkedIn, Facebook or Twitter) in order to login to our site (this may be done in addition to or instead of creating an account on our site). If you choose to utilize social login, we may receive information about you from the social networking provider. For example, if you login using Facebook, Facebook may provide information such as your name, email address, public profile photo and gender. If you do not wish to share the information your social login provides, you can disconnect that login from your Inside Higher Ed account.
