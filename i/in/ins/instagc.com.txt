Special Notification with respect to Children's Privacy (users under the age of 13)
In response to concerns about protecting children's privacy online, Congress enacted the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA"), which sets forth rules and procedures governing the ways in which Web sites may collect, use and disclose any personal information for children under the age of 13. In accordance with the Company policy and COPPA regulations, we DO NOT:
- Request or knowingly collect personally identifiable information online or offline contact information from users under 13 years of age; or

We request that children under the age of 13 not submit any Personal Information to us. It is possible that by fraud or deception we may receive information given to us or pertaining to children under 13.
