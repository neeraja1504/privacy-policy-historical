Sharing Tool
A "sharing" tool is made available to you by Inside Weddings. You can find the “share” tool on the Site and it may also be used in our emails and other communications to you. This tool allows Members to send information about Inside Weddings, our services and offerings, such as an article, real wedding, wedding professional/vendor (“Business Member”) listing, inspiration board, event, or image, to another person via email or social media. You acknowledge that we may store this information for marketing and tracking purposes to rate the success of the “share” feature. You may also be able to provide us with information about other people involved in your event, such as your significant other, wedding party, etc. This information will be treated in accordance with this Policy.

You should review the privacy policies of social networking services you utilize. You can modify your privacy settings directly with those services. We reserve the right to use, transfer, assign, sell, share, and provide access to all personally identifiable information and other information about you and your computer, mobile or other device that we receive through third-party social networking services in the same ways described in this Policy.

If you are a registered Member and terminate your Inside Weddings account, we will mark your account in our database as “inactive”, but will keep your information in our database. This is necessary in order to deter fraud. We will maintain information on Members who have been removed for violating our Terms of Use. We will not use your personally identifiable information for any further purpose, except as necessary to prevent fraud and assist law enforcement, or as required by law. To terminate your membership, contact us at membersupport@insideweddings.com.
Business Member Reviews
Inside Weddings Members who are clients of participating Business Members may provide public reviews (“Review(s)”) of their work and/or services. When you submit a Review on the Site, your name and photo (if provided) will be made available as part of the Review posting.

**Business Member Directory  **
Inside Weddings provides a listing by sortable categories of participating Business Members. If your wedding professional is registered, their profile will be made available in the Directory. As specified in our Terms of Use, after Inside Weddings and the Business Member have terminated their relationship, Inside Weddings shall be entitled to retain all Reviews associated with a Business Member on the Site as well as basic directory information, including, without limitation, business name, address and telephone number.
SITE USAGE AND TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES
Depending on how you use and access the Site, our servers may automatically collect information about you and your computer, such as browser type, software, IP address, and other personal information to help identify you and your usage.

We may utilize additional tracking technologies on the Site to collect detailed information about your Site visits, and may also include personal information about you. Some examples of the types of tracking technologies we may use include: cookies, web beacons, flash cookies, pixel tags, and HTML5.

By using our Site, you acknowledge and agree to our use of these tracking technologies.
Third Parties
We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit the Site. These companies may use information about your visits to this Site and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. These companies may employ cookies, clear GIFs and other tracking technologies to cause relevant ads to be displayed to you. We may also share aggregated Member and/or visitors information with third parties, such as our advertisers. For example, we may disclose the number of Members and/or visitors that have been exposed to, or clicked on, advertisements. Surveys on the website may also be conducted by and processed via a third party.

**Member-Uploaded Information  **
Inspiration boards, images, Reviews, and other Member-uploaded information to the Site, is deemed public and may be available for other Inside Weddings Members access or viewing, provided that the Member uploading the Content does not choose to mark the content as private. Private inspiration boards are visible to you and other participants on the board, and any participant may choose to make the contents of the board available to anyone else. For example, another participant may invite someone else to the board, or even just take an image from the board and email it to their friends. You post content on the Site at your own risk. Although we allow you to set privacy options, please be aware that no security measures are guaranteed, and we cannot control the actions of other Site Members with whom you may choose to share your information.

Inside Weddings may make mobile applications (“apps”) available for you to download and use on your mobile device or smartphone and/or tablet. Similar to the information we collect when you use a computer, we may also collect Personal Information as well as other usage information through the app. Some information, for example, such as real-time location may be able to be modified by managing your location preferences in the app and/or device directly. This Policy may be supplemented with additional terms or privacy policies of which we will notify you by posting them on such apps.
CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS
California's "Shine the Light" law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers asking about the businesses' practices related to disclosing Personal Information to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. Alternately, such businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose Personal Information of customers to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes if the customer has exercised an option to opt out of such information-sharing. As discussed above, if you wish to opt out of our sharing of your information with third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes, edit your preferences in your account profile at www.insideweddings.com, or email us at membersupport@insideweddings.com (please include your name, mailing address, and email address).

If we believe that the security of your Personal Information in our care may have been compromised, you acknowledge that we may seek to notify you by email. Although we cannot guarantee the security of the information collected and received, we have implemented safeguards intended to eliminate the risk of a security breach.
For example, where appropriate, we:
store data in controlled facilities;
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL);
use HTTPS encryption when you authenticate (i.e., log into one of our Services), which helps prevent unauthorized access to your login credentials;
restrict certain employees from accessing Personal Information who do not need that access to perform their jobs
require our employees to use password-protected screen savers when leaving their desks;
