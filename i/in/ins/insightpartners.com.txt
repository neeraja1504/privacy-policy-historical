Your Rights to Your Personal Data if You are an E.U. Resident

For example, you have the right to request from us access to and rectification or erasure of your personal data, the right to restrict processing, object to processing and (in certain circumstances) the right to data portability. If you have provided consent for the processing of your data, you have the right (in certain circumstances) to withdraw that consent at any time; however, such withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before your consent was withdrawn. You also have the right to lodge a complaint if you believe that we have not complied with the requirements of the GDPR regarding your personal data. To make a request or to lodge a complaint with respect to your personal data, please contact us at datainquiries@insightpartners.com.
For Users of the Criteria Service
This portion of the privacy policy describes how we process and share personal information we may receive about you from Criteria Corp. (“Criteria”) when you use Criteria’s website at www.ondemandassessment.com (the “Service”).  Insight is an equity investor in some of the companies that use the Service (the “Employers”), and we process the information Criteria shares with us to, among other things, monitor and improve the performance and use of the Service.  Please read this portion of the privacy policy carefully to understand what information Insight collects from Criteria regarding the individuals who use the Service, and how it uses and shares that information.
What Information Do We Collect?
As described in Criteria’s privacy policy, Criteria shares with Insight certain personal information provided by individuals who use the Service. Such personal data includes:
Contact information (including name, test-event ID, and email address);
Test results (including score, report or other performance evaluation); and
Other personal information you may provide as part of the employment application process.
If you live in the United States, we may collect certain information that is considered "sensitive" personal information, such as demographic or ethnicity information, to monitor compliance with applicable non-discrimination laws.  You do not have to submit this information and, where you have submitted this information and given us consent to use the information, you may withdraw your consent at any time. If you wish to withdraw your consent, please contact us at datainquiries@insightpartners.com.
Note that we will not share with the Employers any of this sensitive information, except in anonymized and aggregated form. The Employer will never know if you do or do not submit this information, and your decision to provide the information or not, or to consent or not (or to withdraw consent) will play no role in any hiring decisions by the Employer.
How Do We Use and Share Your Personal Data?
Insight and third-parties working on our behalf use the information collected via your use of the Service to:
Monitor and improve the Service;
Monitor compliance with applicable non-discrimination and anti-bias laws and requirements; and
Communicate with you solely in connection with your use of the Service.
Insight has a legitimate business interest in performing these limited processing activities to ensure that the Service continues to perform as expected by Insight and the Employers.  To the extent that certain processing activities, or the processing of certain data, requires us to seek your consent, we have done so — for example, with respect to the sensitive information mentioned above.
Insight may also process or share your information in connection with a sale or other transfer of all or some of the assets of Insight and/or in connection with a sale or merger of Insight or any division of Insight, or to operate Insight’s systems properly.  Insight has a legitimate interest in such processing activities.
Lastly, Insight may share your information with third parties as permitted or required by law, including: (a) to comply with the law or in response to a subpoena, court order, government request, or other legal process; (b) to produce relevant documents or information in connection with litigation, arbitration, mediation, adjudication, government or internal investigations, or other legal or administrative proceedings; (c) to protect the interests, rights, safety, or property of Insight or others; or (d) to enforce any terms of service or other legal disclosures on or related to the test.
To the extent any of this processing takes place, Insight will only perform such processing to the extent necessary for compliance with applicable legal requirements.
