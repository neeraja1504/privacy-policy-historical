The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. If your personal data is transferred to, stored at or otherwise processed in a country or territory outside the EEA, and that country or territory has not been recognised as providing an adequate level of data protection, we will put in place additional safeguards to protect your personal data, based on standard contractual clauses.  You can ask us to provide a copy of these clauses by using the contact details below.
THIRD PARTIES AND DATA TRANSFER ACROSS BORDERS

Your personal information may be collected, stored, transferred or processed by our sister companies within the WPP group, or 3rd party service providers for research-related purposes, such as data processing, and fulfilment of prize draws or other incentives both within and outside the EEA.

We request that our third party contractors and site service providers follow similar standards of security and confidentiality.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure.

AUTOMATED DECISION MAKING / PROFILING
In certain circumstances we shall carry out automated decision making or profiling about you.  However, in the majority of cases this will not result in any legally significant decisions being made about you.  You have the right to appeal if any automated decision made about you is legally significant.  If you have any questions about this please contact us.
