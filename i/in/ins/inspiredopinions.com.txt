Though we have undertaken all commercially reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized Internet access to data retained in our servers, however, due to the inherent open nature of the Internet, no transmission via the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

Therefore, by using this Site, you assume all risks associated with any data transmission, including the risk that your Personal Information may be intercepted in transit.

However, if at any time in the future we plan to use Personal Information in a way that differs from this policy, we will post such changes here. Your continued use of the Service following the posting of any changes to this policy means you accept such changes. Please check this page periodically for changes to this Privacy Policy.

We encourage you to be aware when you leave our Site, or surf the Internet, and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that you visit. We do not endorse, screen or approve, and are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such other web sites.
Cookies and Web Beacons:
This Site may use "cookies" to improve our service. A cookie is a small data file that web sites often store on your computer's hard drive when you visit their sites. A cookie file can contain various types of information, including a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you have visited. We may use cookies to enhance your experience on this Site, to determine user traffic patterns, and for other similar purposes. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. However, you can configure your browser to alert you when a web site is attempting to send you a cookie and at that time you will have the option of refusing the cookie in which case you may still use the Site, but it may interfere with some of its functionality.
As noted above, we may supplement the information we receive on this Site with information from third party sources. As an example, we may combine cookie data gathered on this Site with cookie data from a third party in order to improve our services. For instance, in some surveys, a third party website may look for cookies on your browser. If the third party detects the cookies, it may gather information about where you have seen a particular ad and how many times you have seen it. No personally identifiable information, such as your email address, would be transmitted via this cookie; however, this third party information would still enhance our ability to compile useful data from the survey.
We may use third-party advertising companies to measure advertising effectiveness. These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons). Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous. This anonymous information does not include your address, email address, or other personally identifiable information. While we use cookies in other parts of the Site (as discussed above), cookies received with banner ads are collected by those advertisers and their ad service providers, and we do not have access to that information. The ad company's privacy policy and/or that of its service provider will govern the use of this information and we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such ad company.
Clickstream:
As you use the Internet, a trail of electronic information is left at each web site you visit. This information, which is sometimes referred to as "clickstream data," may be collected and stored by a web site's server. Clickstream data can tell us the type of computer and browsing software you use and the address of the web site from which you linked to the Site. We may collect and use clickstream data as a form of Aggregate Information to anonymously determine how much time visitors spend on each page of our Site, how visitors navigate throughout the Site and how we may tailor our web pages to better meet the needs of visitors. This information will be used to improve our Site and our services. Any collection or use of clickstream data will be anonymous and aggregate, and will not contain any Personal Information.
