4      WHY DO WE COLLECT YOUR PERSONAL DATA AND ON WHAT
GROUNDS?
We collect personal data about you for various reasons.
In general terms, INSEAD collects and uses your personal data to function
effectively and optimise your experience with its departments. Generally,
this processing is necessary for:
-   the management, processing and tracking of your requests for the
attention of INSEAD, with some of these operations being
necessary to perform contractual or pre-contractual measures taken
at your request (as part of a job application or a training programme
or following a request to register for an event);
-   to pursue INSEAD’s legitimate interests in the framework of
management and supervision of admissions to our training
programmes, the management and organisation of its prospecting,
canvassing and communication operations and marketing generally;
You should also be aware that we can only collect and use your personal
data if that use is based on one of the legal grounds determined by the
GDPR (e.g. your consent or performance of a contract concluded with us).
The table below specifically lists the purposes for use of your personal data
by INSEAD, based on one or more of the following legal grounds:
-   Your consent
-   Performance of a contract concluded with you
-   Compliance with a legal obligation
-   Safeguarding your vital interests
-   Performance of a public service mission
-   Legitimate interests of INSEAD in collecting your personal data.
Purposes of collecting your personal data

5     WHAT PERSONAL DATA DO WE COLLECT?
Your personal data is particularly collected and processed, entirely or
partially, when you browse the Site and enter information in its data
collection forms (brochure requests, registration for events, applications for
our training programmes, etc.) and, more generally, in the framework of
your relations and exchanges via the Site and subsequent (online or offline)
communication with INSEAD.
Generally, your data is therefore collected directly from you under the
circumstances mentioned below.
In addition to that information, you are informed that the data we collect and
process about you may be enhanced by us via information sources (other
web platforms provided by INSEAD, rental of files, recommendations or
information from third parties, etc.).
Furthermore, more specifically in relation to the information processed in
this respect by our recruitment operations, we use the information you send
us by email to incorporate into our file of applicants (CV library). However,
we may also contact third parties (e.g. recruitment agencies, previous
7
employers, internship supervisors or clients you have worked with in
previous roles) to collect information about you in order to study your
application.
Within the Site, you are informed of the compulsory nature of providing your
personal data on each collection form by the presence of an asterisk
alongside the relevant field(s). Where no asterisk is present, the requested
information is optional.
If the compulsory information is not entered, the request associated with
that collection of personal data (e.g. brochure request, registration for an
event, application for a training programme, etc.) may not be able to be
processed or its processing may be delayed.
In respect of optional information requested, they are generally designed to
provide us with a better knowledge of Site users and their preferences.
INSEAD encourages users to provide this information in order to help
ensure that the contents of our Site remain relevant to your interests and
needs.
6     WHO DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL DATA WITH?
In the course of our activities, we may need to share your personal data.
Obviously, whenever we do so we always ensure optimal protection of your
personal data.

6.2    Sharing of your personal data with our partners
Any of our service providers and contractual and commercial partners that
may be involved in processing the above-mentioned personal data may
have access to your personal data.
6.3    Other sharing
With public authorities, in response to legal requests, including to respond
to national security requirements or application of the law.
In the context of a transaction, such as a merger, acquisition, consolidation
or sale of assets, we may need to share your personal data with buyers or
sellers.
7     HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL DATA?
INSEAD has determined precise rules concerning how long we retain your
personal data. This length of time varies depending on the different
purposes and must take into account any legal obligations to retain some of
your data.
The retention time within INSEAD has been defined to allow us to process
your requests (brochures, contacts, registration for an event, job application
or registration for a training programme, etc.), manage and monitor them
and/or      complete     our   prospecting,     canvassing     loyalty-building,
communication and marketing operations, while complying with the principle
of proportionality according to which personal data must not be retained for
longer than necessary to fulfil the purpose for which it was collected.
It is nevertheless specified that all of this data may be retained for longer
than the lengths of time mentioned in this article:
   either with your consent;
   or in the form of archives, to respond to any legal or regulatory
obligations applicable to INSEAD or for the legal limitation or
objection periods.
9
    or in the form of data reused for the purposes of logs, statistics or
research.

managed or updated by INSEAD and are therefore not covered by this
charter. INSEAD does not have any control over the content of those
websites, nor over their confidentiality policies, their use of personal data,
use of cookies, or the way in which they collect, process and store that
data. You are therefore advised to consult the terms and conditions for
collecting and using personal data established by those external sites
before sending them any information.

You can exercise this right when:

recording, the exercise or defence of your rights in legal proceedings, or to

excessive number of requests.
9.6     Objection right
You have the right to object to us processing your personal data if, for your
own reasons, you consider that one of the forms of processing infringes
your privacy and causes you excessive harm. You cannot prevent us from
processing your data:
  if its processing is required to conclude or perform your contract.
For example, your data must be processed to validate your
registration with INSEAD;
  if its processing is required by law or a regulation. That is
particularly the case when you move to another address;
  if its processing is required to officially record, exercise or defend
rights in legal proceedings.
You can object to the use of your personal data for the purposes of
marketing communications and particularly advertising. You can also object
to profiling if it is linked to marketing communications (e.g. when we send
you personalised content).
You simply need to send an email to 5555-itservicedesk@insead.edu with
the subject line “objection right: personal data”, attaching a copy of your
identity document showing your signature.
It is important to include the reasons for your objection request.
You can also exercise this right by sending us a letter to the following
address: INSEAD, Boulevard de Constance, 77305 Fontainebleau, France.
Your written request must be signed and accompanied by a photocopy of
your identity document bearing your signature. The request must specify
the address to which the response should be sent.
INSEAD has two months to respond to your objection request. If your
request is imprecise or does not include all the information enabling us to
fulfil your request, we will contact you to ask for further information within
that time.
However, it may be that we are able to accede to your request. In that case,
we will of course provide you with as clear a response as possible.
Furthermore, any emails and newsletters which may be sent to you will
contain a link you can click on to stop receiving promotional information
from us.
Specifically in relation to your right to object to marketing communications,
we remind you that our marketing partners are responsible for their use of
14
your personal data and taking into account your rights, including to no
longer receive offers from them.
9.7    Right to digital death
You have the option to send us instructions relating to the retention,
deletion and communication of your personal data after your death. Those
instructions may also be recorded with a “certified digital trusted third party”.
Those instructions, a sort of “digital will”, may appoint a person responsible
for their execution or, failing, that your heirs will be appointed.
In the absence of any instructions, you heirs may contact us to:
   Access the processing of personal data in order to “organise and
settle the deceased’s estate”;
   Receive communication of the “digital goods” or “personal data
containing family memories, transferable to the heirs”;
   Close your personal account on the Site and object to the continued
processing of your personal data.
In any case, you have the option of informing us, at any time, that you do
not want your personal data to be communicated to a third party after your
death.
9.8    Portability right
This right gives you the possibility of more easily managing your personal
data yourself, specifically:
retrieving your personal data processed by us, for your personal use, and
storing it on a device or in a private cloud for example.
transferring your personal data from us to another company, either by you,
or directly by us, subject to that direct transfer being “technically possible”.
That right covers both your actively and knowingly declared data, such as
your data supplied to create your online account (e.g. email address,
username, age) and the information collected by INSEAD.
Conversely, personal data derived, calculated or inferred from data you
have supplied, e.g. the results of a medical examination, is excluded from
the portability right since it has been created by INSEAD.
You simply need to send an email to 5555-itservicedesk@insead.edu
stating your full name and with the subject line “portability right: personal
data”, attaching a copy of your identity document showing your signature.
Do not forget to indicate in your email the files concerned and the type of
request (data retrieval and/or transfer to a new service provider).
You can also exercise this right by sending us a letter to the following
address: INSEAD, Boulevard de Constance, 77305 Fontainebleau, France.
Your written request must be signed and accompanied by a photocopy of
your identity document bearing your signature. The request must specify
the address to which the response should be sent. A response will then be
sent to you within one month following receipt of the request, two months in
15
the event of a request requiring more in-depth research or in the event that
INSEAD receives an excessive number of requests.
You should be aware, however, that INSEAD is entitled to refuse your
portability request. In fact, this right only applies to personal data based on
your consent or performance of a contract concluded with us (for more
details of personal data covered by the portability right: click on the
Purposes and Grounds section). Similarly, this right may not infringe on
third-party rights and freedoms, whose data may be contained in the data
transmitted following a portability request.
10 IS YOUR PERSONAL DATA SENT ABROAD?
10.1 Data transfer within Europe
Personal data benefits from the same level of protection within the
European Economic Area.
We process your personal data on IT servers located in the EEA.
10.2 Data transfer outside Europe
INSEAD transfers, processes and stores your information on IT servers
located in a number of countries outside Europe as set out in the table
below.
You should be aware that protection of privacy and rules allowing
authorities to access your personal data in those countries are not
necessarily equivalent to those in Europe.
In order to ensure standards are adhered to in terms of data and privacy
protection, we impose technical and legal guarantees on all our partners.
11 DATA SECURITY
INSEAD takes all useful and appropriate physical, logical, technical,
functional, administrative and organisational precautions and measures to
guarantee the security of your personal data, with regard to the state of the
art, implementation costs and the nature, extent, context and purposes of
the processing, as well as the risks, whose degree of likelihood and severity
vary, to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, to preserve data
security and confidentiality and guarantee a level of security appropriate to
the risks, and particularly to prevent the data being distorted, damaged or
accessed by unauthorised third parties.
Due to the difficulties inherent in exercising an activity on the internet and
the risks, of which you are aware, resulting from the electronic transmission
of data, INSEAD may not be bound by a performance obligation.
In the event that difficulties occur, INSEAD shall do its utmost to circumvent
the risks and shall take all adequate measures, in accordance with its legal
and regulatory obligations (corrective actions, informing the national
16
authority responsible for personal data protection and, where relevant, data
subjects, etc.).
In the event that all or part of the personal data processing is
subcontracted, INSEAD contractually imposes security guarantees on its
subcontractors, particularly in terms of confidentiality in respect of the
personal data to which they may have access (appropriate technical and
organisational measures to protect that data).
