Privacy Policy | Insomniac Games
Insomniac Games, Inc., is committed to maximizing your experience on its website within a trusted environment. This privacy policy explains how we collect, protect, use and share information gathered about you online. We hope this disclosure will help increase your confidence in the Insomniac Games website and enhance your experience.

What types of information does Insomniac Games collect and how will it be used?
Insomniac Games only collects information on a voluntary basis. The personal information we collect is used exclusively for communication and marketing research purposes. The majority of content on our site is offered without our collecting any personally identifiable information from you. There are a few activities on our site where the collection of personally identifiable information is necessary. Those activities include things like signing up for an email newsletter or other online information service we may offer, entering a contest, answering a survey, or contacting us. Visitors who wish to subscribe to the Insomniac Games community will be asked to provide some personal information such as an email address. For example, the submitted email address would then be used to send you, via email, our news updates and to otherwise keep you informed as to what’s going on at Insomniac Games. Surveys are conducted strictly for internal profiling purposes and only keep track of anonymous demographic data (e.g., your age, games played, consoles owned). Our website contains links through which an online visitor can email us. We collect personal information contained in the email for the purpose of responding to a visitor’s questions and/or comments. From time to time, we may post on our website job openings at Insomniac Games and provide an email address to which interested applicants can submit their resume. Although we can assure you that any personal information contained in a resume will be used solely for its intended purpose (i.e., to evaluate the applicant.s qualifications), such information is not subject to this privacy policy.
No matter what method we use to collect information and no matter how we use that information, we will only collect the information deemed reasonably necessary to fulfill your online requests and our legitimate business objectives.

Does Insomniac Games use cookies or other means to collect information?
You will know when personally identifiable information is collected because you will be asked to fill out a form. However, we may collect some information about you by using data collection technology, so that it may not be readily apparent to you that it is being collected. For instance, when you come to our website, your IP address is collected so that we know where to send information you are requesting. An IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer every time you log on to the Internet. A “cookie” is a small file or record-keeping device that websites often store on a user’s computer. (You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent to your computer.) We do not use IP addresses or cookies to collect personally identifiable information, such as your name, or to link this information to personally identifiable information already collected about you. This information may be used to make our site more interesting and useful to you. Additionally, we may combine this information with personally identifiable information to identify a visitor in order to enforce compliance with our Terms of Use, or to protect our service, website or visitors to the website.
With whom does Insomniac Games share my personally identifiable information?
From time to time, we may employ and share your personal information with vendors who use it solely to provide support for the internal operations of our website (e.g., technical support and network delivery). These entities will not use your personally identifiable information for any other purpose, and have agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the personal information they obtain from us.
It is our policy not to share, sell or rent your personal information to any company not directly related to the manufacture or publishing of Insomniac Games products.
