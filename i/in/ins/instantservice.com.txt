Our site's registration form requests users to give us contact information which includes, but is not limited to, contact name(s), email address(es) and phone numbers.
Contact information from the registration form is used to provide information about your company and may be used to send out promotional material about our services and our partners. Your contact information is also used to get in touch with you when necessary due to changes in services or to respond to a request for support from our Services Organization.

When you decide to purchase our product, in addition to the information we requested for registration, we ask for Company name and address (if applicable), billing address, and payment method (invoice, credit card, etc.). This information is used to process your order. All information we gather is stored in a secure database.

Periodically we may request our visitors to complete (at their discretion) online surveys that will provide InstantService with contact information (like e-mail addresses, name and address of your company, your position), unique identifiers (like account numbers), and company demographic information (like zip code, primary business and financial status).
Contact information from the surveys is used to send promotional material from some of our partners to our customers. This information is also used to get in touch with visitors if additional information is requested or if the visitor left the Web site without completing the entire survey form.
