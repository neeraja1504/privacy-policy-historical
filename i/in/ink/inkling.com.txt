Privacy - Inkling
Inkling Systems, Inc. (“Inkling” or “we” or “us”) recognizes that your privacy is very important and takes it seriously. This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes Inkling’s policies and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of your personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) when you use the Inkling website and domain name, any other linked pages, features, content, mobile applications, and any other services we offer from time to time in connection with any of the above (collectively, the “Service”). The Inkling Terms of Use, including their paragraphs limiting damages and providing for individual arbitration of disputes, apply to and are incorporated by reference into this Policy. This Policy does not apply to information we collect by other means (including offline) or from other sources.
Information Collected by Inkling
Inkling uses the Personal Information and other information we collect to, among other things, analyze how the Service is used, diagnose service or technical problems, maintain security, personalize content, remember information to help you efficiently access your account, monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns, and track user content and users as necessary to improve the Service and comply with applicable laws.
You can choose not to provide us with any or all of the information we specify or request, but then you may not be able to register with us or to take advantage of some or all of our features.
The Inkling Service is available to business and enterprise customers (and their users, collectively, the “business users”). In order to provide the Service, Inkling collects information from its business users that may include personal information of business users. We also collect certain information directly from business users’ employees and other users who access the Service. Certain Inkling services and features also available to consumers (the “consumer users”). Unless otherwise noted, references to users or end users include both consumer users and business users.
Information We Collect Directly. When a user registers for an account with us, accesses our Service, or updates their profile with us, we collect certain information directly from that user, including name and email address, as well as other information added to a user’s profile.
We may also receive certain additional user information from our business users. For example, our business users may provide us with the names and email addresses of their employees or other agents who are authorized to access the Service, as well as other information about such employees or agents.
Your name and other information you choose to add to your profile may be available to other users of the Service. Users may also be able to follow other users; if a user chooses to follow you, the user will be able to see the information, such as notes and certain profile information, that you have not set to private. Consumer users may login to Inkling using their social networking site (“SNS”) account credentials. If you use your Facebook®, Twitter®, or other SNS credentials to sign in to Inkling, we will collect and store your SNS user ID. We may also collect information you supply to us regarding your personal preferences and interests. If you use your SNS account credentials to access the Service, you understand that some content and/or information in your SNS account (“Third Party Account Information”) may be transmitted into your account with us if you authorize such transmissions, and that Third Party Account Information transmitted to our Service is covered by this Policy. You also provide us information by submitting user-generated content to the Service (“User-generated Content”), including your notes and highlights, and collaborate with other users.
Consumer Users.  Your User-generated Content, and metadata about it (such as when you submitted the User-generated Content), may be viewable by other Inkling users, along with your first name and the first initial of your last name (unless the Service permits you to post anonymously). You may generally control whether your User-generated Content is private or public either at the time you submit such information or when setting the preferences for your account.
Business Users.  Business users can collaborate with other business users, their subcontractors and other collaborators within the same organizations, as part of a project or otherwise. In such cases, the content you post is shared with these other users unless you set it to private; your name and email address is also viewable by other users within your organization.
Invite A Friend. Consumer users may invite other users and share or gift content to other consumer users. If you choose to follow a friend using the Service, invite a friend to use the Service or gift Inkling content to a friend, we will ask you for that person’s email address. Inkling stores the email addresses you submit to send relevant communications, to register your friend if your invitation or gift is accepted, to track the success of invitation and gifting programs, and to identify your friends on Inkling.

Third Party sites and Applications.  Businesses or third party websites we work with may provide services to you through the Service (either alone or jointly with us). For example, we include the ability for you to automatically transmit information from your Inkling account to an account on a third party website or service, such as Facebook. We do not control the policies and practices of third party websites or businesses, such as Facebook, even if they may be affiliated or partnered with us or the Service, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or service relating to a third party website or business, please review all relevant privacy and other policies of such website or business.
Affiliates.  We may disclose the Personal Information we collect from you to our affiliates or subsidiaries; however, if we do so, their use and disclosure of your Personal Information will be subject to this Policy.
Business Transactions.  As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings.

Our Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms
We and our third party service providers use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to track information about your use of our Service. We may combine this information with other personal information we collect from you (and our third party service providers may do so on our behalf).
Cookies.  Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our Service, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process, to allow us to track your activities on our Service, or to otherwise enable Service features. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Visitors to our site who disable cookies will be able to browse certain areas of the site, but some features may not function.
Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies.  Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs (also known as web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our site to, among other things, track the activities of site visitors, help us manage content and compile statistics about site usage. We or our service providers may also use clear GIFs in HTML emails to our customers to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed and track whether our emails are forwarded.
LSOs. We or third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features of the Service or to display advertising based upon your tracked activity may use Local Storage Objects (LSOs) using technologies such as HTML5 or Flash to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs. To learn about managing Flash LSOs, please click here.
Third-party Analytics.  We use third party analytics tools, such as Google Analytics, to collect, monitor and analyze collected information in order to improve functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor the Services to our visitors’ needs. Accordingly, usage data is shared with Google, which has its own privacy policy addressing how it uses such information. We encourage you to review this privacy policy to understand how Google uses such information.
California Do Not Track Disclosure
Currently, our systems do not recognize browser “do-not-track” requests.  You may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed above (e.g., by disabling cookies). For more information about tracking, please click here.
Interest-Based Advertising
We use third parties such as network advertisers to serve advertisements on our Site and on third-party websites or other media (e.g. social networking platforms). For example, we use LinkedIn, Microsoft AdCenter, and Google Ad Words to serve advertisements on third-party websites. This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested. Third-party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), LSOs and other tracking technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These third-party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party’s specific privacy policy, not this one. We may provide these third-party advertisers with information, including Personal Information, about you.
Users in the United States may opt out of many third-party ad networks. For example, you may go to the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) Consumer Choice Page for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and choices regarding having information used by DAA companies. You may also go to the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) Consumer Opt-Out Page for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and choices regarding having information used by NAI members.
Users in the European Union may also opt out of many third-party ad networks. For example, you may go to the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (“EDAA”) Your Online Choices Page for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and choices regarding having information used by EDAA members.
Opting out from one or more companies listed on the DAA Consumer Choice Page, the NAI Consumer Opt-Out Page or the EDAA Your Online Choices Page will opt you out from those companies’ delivery of interest-based content or ads to you, but it does not mean you will no longer receive any advertising through our Site or on other websites. You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing (i.e., contextually based ads). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you opt out on the DAA, NAI, or EDAA-related websites, your opt out may not be effective. Additional information is available on the DAA’s website at www.aboutads.info, the NAI’s website at www.networkadvertising.org, and the EDAA’s website at www.youronlinechoices.com/goodpractice.

We may also use your contact information to send you marketing email messages. If you do not want to receive such messages, you may opt out by following the instructions in the message. If you do not wish to receive email offers and certain Service-related messages, please indicate your preference in your “Privacy Settings” in the Inkling application or on the Inkling website.

These features are displayed on our site, but are hosted by third parties, and are subject to their own privacy policies, not this one.
Security
We have implemented safeguards to protect the information we collect from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Please be aware that despite our best efforts, no data security measures can guarantee 100% security. You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password private. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity.
Consent to Transfer Personal Information to the United States
If you are located outside of the United States, please note that your Personal Information will be transferred to and processed in the United States.
