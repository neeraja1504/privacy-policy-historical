What information about me is collected and stored?
Information Provided by You
We collect and store information that you provide to us through our interactions with you, including through our website, through our customer service representatives, at events, through mobile applications, and through third parties.
You may elect not to provide certain information, which could result in you not being able to take advantage of certain capabilities of this website, our mobile applications or other services we offer. We may request, collect and store some or all of the following types of personal information: your name, billing address, shipping address, e-mail address, location, telephone number, financial and payment information, including your credit card number and expiration date, gender, date of birth, and any information about a third party you provide accessing the website. If you access our website or mobile applications with your log-in credentials from a social networking site (e.g. Facebook, Google, or Twitter) or if you otherwise agree to associate your account with us with a social networking site, we may receive personal information about you from such social networking site, in accordance with the terms of use and privacy policy of such social networking site. This may include your email address, public profile (including your name, profile picture, gender, age, and the names of your other “friends” on such social networking sites). We may add this to the information we have already collected from you via other interactions.
Automatically Collected Information
We collect and store certain other non-personally identifiable information automatically whenever you interact with us. For example, we may collect your Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser information and reference site domain name when you visit this website. We may analyze this data for preferences, trends, and site usage statistics.
Other information we may collect includes your behavior on our site. We use this information to improve the user experience. This may include, but is not limited to: your activities and clicks on our website, maps accessed, comments, tags, notifications, and shares. This information may also include your interactions with other users on our site.   We may also collect information by using cookies, web beacons, and related technologies in order to analyze and understand how the website is used and to improve your visits to the website. For example, we may use cookies and related technologies to: (i) customize account pages for you, (ii) track user visits and account features, (iii) determine what features and pages are most frequently requested or visited, and (iv) save your password so you do not have to provide it each time you visit the website.   "Cookies" are small text files that a website sends to a user's hard drive through the browser for data storage. Most browsers accept cookies automatically but allow you to disable them. By disabling or otherwise rejecting cookies, you may not be able to take full advantage of all offerings on this website. We recommend that you leave cookies "turned on" so that we can offer you a better overall experience on this website.   We use third-party companies to provide Internet data hosting and to help us measure and determine how visitors use our website and to evaluate the effectiveness of our website and promotions so that we can improve and optimize our website and the products and services we offer. We use third-party companies to serve advertisements (banners or links) on our behalf throughout the Internet. These companies use tracking technologies (including cookies and pixel tags) to collect non-identifiable information about your visits to our website and your interactions with our products and services.   Our websites currently do not have a mechanism to recognize “Do Not Track” signals, but several of the third-party companies who utilize these cookies or beacons enable you to opt out of this advertising. If you wish to opt out of receiving this third-party interest-based advertising, you may obtain more information here. Please note this does not opt you out of receiving marketing communications from us.
Some of our e-mail communications to you may include a "click-through URL" linked to a particular page on the website. By clicking on one of these URLs, you will automatically enter our website and we may collect information related to the "click-through." You may avoid having this information collected by not clicking on URL links in our e-mail communications.
How Do I Indicate Whether Or Not I Want To Receive Promotional Communications?
You will be able to change your email preferences for receiving promotional emails by clicking on an "unsubscribe" hyperlink contained in promotional e-mails we send you. Please note that removal of personal information from our database or "opting-out" will not stop marketing or advertising content that is generated for distribution or is otherwise queued for transmission to you prior to the time when we can implement your request.
If you establish an account, you may receive certain types of communications even if you have not opted-in to receive them because these types of communications may be necessary in order to maintain an account on the website.
Information from Other Sources
We may collect information about you from third-party sources and information that is publicly available. For example, information you submit in a public forum (e.g., a blog, chat room, or social network site) can be read, collected, or used by us and others, and could be used to personalize your experience. You are responsible for the information you choose to submit in these instances. Another example, is that we may receive demographic information about you from a third party to make our service and marketing efforts more efficient and personalized for you.

We also use your information for business purposes such as security, legal compliance, payment processing, analytics, operations, fraud detection, reporting, and making back-ups.
