OUR USE OF COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING MECHANISMS
We and our third party service providers use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to track information about your use of our App. We may combine this information with other personal information we collect from you (and our third party service providers may do so on our behalf).
Cookies .   A cookie is a text file that a website transfers to your computer’s hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to use our App, while others are used to allow us to track your activities while using our App. There are two types of cookies: session and persistent cookies. Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser or turn off your computer. We use session cookies to allow our systems to uniquely identify you during a session or while you are using the App. This allows us to verify your identity as you use our App. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or turned off your computer. We use persistent cookies to track aggregate and statistical information about user activity, and to display advertising on our App. To see a full list of our cookies and details of why we use them, please click  here .
Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Users of our App who disable cookies will be able to use certain functions of the App, but some features may not function (e.g., you may not be able to stay logged into your account).
Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies . Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web or mobile application pages. We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our App to, among other things, track the activities of App users, help us manage content, and compile statistics about usage of our App. We and our third party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML emails to our customers, to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded.
Third Party Analytics . We use automated devices and applications,  in particular Google Analytics , to evaluate usage of our App, and to the extent permitted, our App. We also may use other analytic means to evaluate our App. We use these tools to help us improve our App’s performance and user experiences. These entities may use cookies and other tracking technologies, such as web beacons or local storage objects (LSOs), to perform their services. To learn more about Google’s privacy practices, please review the Google privacy policy at  https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/ . You can also download the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on to prevent their data from being used by Google Analytics at  https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout .
Do Not Track .  Currently, our systems do not recognize browser “do-not-track” requests.  You may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed in this section (e.g., by disabling cookies).
Users in the United States may opt out of many third-party ad networks. For example, you may go to the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”)  Consumer Choice Page  for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and their choices regarding having information used by  DAA companies . You may also go to the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”)  Consumer Opt-Out Page  for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and their choices regarding having information used by  NAI members . If you are in the EU, you may opt-out of certain third party cookies that we and other websites may use for targeted advertising through the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA)  Your Online Choices Page  or  www.aboutads.info .
Opting out from one or more companies listed on the DAA  Consumer Choice Page  or the NAI  Consumer Opt-Out Page  will opt you out from those companies’ delivery of interest-based content or ads to you, but it does not mean you will no longer receive any advertising through our App or on other websites.
THIRD-PARTY LINKS
Our App may contain links to third-party websites. Any access to and use of such linked websites is not governed by this Policy, but instead is governed by the privacy policies of those third party websites. We are not responsible for the information practices of such third party websites.
SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
We have implemented reasonable precautions to protect the information we collect from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction, in particular, we support the use of Secure Sockets Layer technology 'SSL' encryption for data during transmissions sent between the App and the servers. Please be aware that despite our efforts, no data security measures can guarantee security. You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password private. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity.
DIRECT MARKETING
We may send periodic promotional emails to you. You may opt-out of promotional communications by following the opt-out instructions contained in the email. Please note that it may take up to 10 business days for us to process opt-out requests. If you opt-out of receiving promotional emails about recommendations or other information we think may interest you, we may still send you emails about your account or any services you have requested or received from us.
