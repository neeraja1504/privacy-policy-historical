The information InkSoft collects is used for internal review and is then discarded, used to improve the content of our website, used to notify consumers about updates to our website or used by us to contact consumers for marketing purposes.

We attempt to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from you at our site. No method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
