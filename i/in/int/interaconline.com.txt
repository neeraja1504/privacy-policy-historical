A cookie is a small text file containing a unique identification number that identifies your browser but not you to our computer each time you visit. We may also use Internet tags, graphic tags and similar web beacon type functions for the same purpose. Like cookies, they do not collect your personal information.
You will find that most major websites use cookies and most major browsers are set up to accept them. You do not need cookies to visit our sites. However, if you refuse to accept cookies, you may not be able to use some of the features available on our sites.

Our sites automatically collect certain information from visitors to our sites, namely IP addresses, information regarding the type of Internet browser and operating system used, and the domain name of the website or advertisement from which the visitors have linked to our sites (if applicable). If you choose to register for the Hub, you may be asked to provide optional information such as the name of the business you work for and/or the industry you work in. We render all of this information anonymous and retain it in aggregate form to measure interest in the Hub, usage of the sites, including but not limited to the total number of visits, average time spent on the sites, and pages viewed, both in real-time, and within a certain historical time frame. We use this aggregated information to improve the utility, security, content and user

Security Safeguards
We take precautions to protect your personal information against unauthorized access, disclosure, inappropriate alteration, and misuse. Access to your personal information is restricted to those individuals whose job responsibilities require them to have access. The precautions taken to protect your personal information include physical, organizational, and technological measures. However, given that electronically transmitted data is not 100% secure, we make no warranties as to the security of any information that you submit to us electronically, which you do at your own risk.
