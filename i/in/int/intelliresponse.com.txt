Cookies, IP Addresses and Other Tracking Technologies
Some parts of this website utilize "cookies" and other third party tracking technologies (such as beacons, tags, and scripts) to analyze trends, administer the site, track users’ movements around the site, to collect information about your activity on this and other websites, and gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you disable the use of cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functions on our website or service. Some cookies and other technologies may serve to recall Personal Information previously supplied or collected by you.
Another method through which we collect aggregate information is the collection of IP addresses.

Other tracking technologies may record information such as Internet domain and host names you visit before and after visiting this website; browser software and operating system types; button click patterns; and dates and times that this website is accessed. Our use of cookies and other tracking technologies allows us to improve this website. We may also analyze information that does not contain Personal Information for trends and statistics.
We and our third party tracking-utility partners utilize (i) a 1x1 image tracking pixel placed on certain webpages of the website to collect relevant information from this website and to set a Cookie on your web browser, (ii) your browser stream data to the this website, or (iii) other information collected from you (collectively, the “Targeting Data”). Such Targeting Data may include, among other things, IP address, date and time of your visit to this website, and website pages visited by you. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information. The Targeting Data is used to provide our targeted advertisements to you while you are on third-party websites with whom we have purchased advertising inventory and may be combined or matched to third party data to identify you and display a targeted advertisement to you.
Personal Preference
You may request information on how your Personal Information is being retained or processed by us or a third party, how to access, request deletion, and review your Personal Information, or request to obtain a copy of the Personal Information we hold, by sending an inquiry to webmaster@247.ai.

If you tell us that you do not wish to have your Personal Information used as a basis for further contact with you, we will respect your wishes. You may choose to opt-out of receiving future e-mail or mailings by following the unsubscribe procedures generally provided with our communications, or by sending an email to webmaster@247.ai specifying "Unsubscribe" in the subject line.
We partner with a third party to either display advertising on our website or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partner may use cookies or similar technologies in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests.

Data Security
We utilize a combination of reasonable and appropriate physical, technical, and administrative safeguards to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, to maintain data accuracy of your Personal Information, and to ensure the appropriate use of Personal Information we collect and process via this website. [24]7.ai retains Personal Information only as required or permitted by local law and while it has a legitimate business purpose to do so.

If you require the Personal Information you have provided [24]7.ai to be updated, or that we delete inaccuracies you may send updates and corrections to [24]7.ai via email to webmaster@247.ai specifying in the Subject line that you wish to provide an update and we will make reasonable efforts to incorporate the changes in our records as soon as practicable, if you provide the information we require to locate your Personal Information in our records (e.g. old name, email address, etc.). Once we make the requested update, we will send you an e-mail confirmation so that you are aware the update or correction has been made.

Third Parties
Occasionally, we may share aggregate, non-personally identifiable information about our users with our business and alliance partners. We also use third party service providers such as an email service provider to send emails on our behalf and an employment partner to process job applications. Other than our business and alliance partners, we do not provide Personal Information to any third party for any purpose whatsoever other than as outlined in this Privacy Policy, and we will not do so unless we are legally required to do so and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our website. Similarly, it is against our policy to sell Personal Information collected online without consent. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that third-parties who receive any of your Personal Information from us protect such information on [24]7.ai's behalf.
In the event [24]7.ai goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred.

Platform Privacy Policy
(last revised on May 06, 2019)
[24]7.ai, Inc and its affiliates (collectively, “[24]7.ai”) provide software platforms, applications, and data analysis systems (collectively, the “[24]7.ai Platform”) which enable [24]7.ai’s clients (DEFINE as “Client”) to better service their current and prospective customers (each an “End User”) via the Internet and telephony networks. This [24]7.ai Platform Privacy Policy is applicable to those Clients and End Users who are either directly or indirectly using the [24]7.ai Platform.
At the contractual direction of [24]7.ai’s clients, [24]7.ai collects and processes End User’s information which may include Personal Information, where “Personal Information” means information that can be used to specifically identify an End User, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, organization name, email address, phone number, postal/zip or other physical address, date of birth, gender, professional title, account information, credit/debit card number, and any other such information needed by the [24]7.ai Platform to provide client-specified services to an End User. [24]7.ai respects the privacy of End Users and is committed to protecting the Personal Information that we receive through their direct and indirect use of the [24]7.ai Platform. Notwithstanding the foregoing, End Users’ use of our clients' Internet- and telephony- based services (and, ultimately, the [24]7.ai Platform) is solely governed by the terms and conditions agreed to directly between End Users and [24]7.ai’s clients (usually via a signed written agreement, “Terms of Use” and/or a “Privacy Policy” on such clients’ websites).
Collection and Use of Information
Certain information about End Users is passively collected through the [24]7.ai Platform without those End Users actively providing that information to [24]7.ai (“Interaction Data”). Collection of Interaction Data is done using various technologies, such as website cookies (see section on cookies below), Internet/web tags, and navigational data collection (e.g. website log files, server logs, etc.). We do not consider Interaction Data to be Personal Information.
Some Interaction Data is automatically transmitted by End Users' Internet web browsers and telephony networks to the [24]7.ai Platform, with examples including: the URL of the website an End User browsed before accessing the [24]7.ai Platform; the Internet Protocol (“IP”) address of the End User's computer (a unique number automatically assigned to an End User's computer when connecting to the Internet, which may vary from session to session); the web browser version that the End User’s computer or mobile device is currently using; the date and time the End User accessed the website or online service; and the specific webpages that an End User accessed while visiting the website. Interaction Data is used by [24]7.ai for internal purposes, to analyze trends, and to improve the [24]7.ai Platform. [24]7.ai also uses Interaction Data to improve our clients’ web, mobile and telephony systems. For example, Interaction Data is collected and used to personalize websites so that their content, layout, functionality, navigation, recommendations, offers and promotions will be more relevant to End Users based on their collective or individual context.
Before using the [24]7.ai Platform, we agree in written contracts with our clients that they have sufficient rights, including their End Users' consent, to allow us to collect both Personal Information and Interaction Data. If you have any concerns about one of our client’s right to collect such data from you and to pass it on to [24]7.ai, please contact that client directly.
We collect the following kinds of personal information from our Clients:
Contact Information such as name, email address, mailing address, phone number
Billing Information such as billing address
Unique Identifiers such as user name and account number
We use this information to provide Clients:
Relevant account or product information
Assistance in completing transactions
Resolution to customer service issues
[24]7.ai collects information under the direction of its clients, and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes.
Cookies
[24]7.ai uses “cookies” or similar technologies to track and collect End Users' Personal Information and Interaction Data. A “cookie” is a small data file that [24]7.ai transfers to an End User’s computer or mobile device for various tracking purposes. [24]7.ai uses these cookies to save relevant data to enhance End Users' experiences while on our clients' websites. End Users may set their web browser to notify them when a cookie is sent, or to refuse cookies altogether, but certain features of the [24]7.ai Platform (and of our clients’ websites) might not work well or at all if cookies are blocked or deleted. Before using the [24]7.ai Platform, our clients promise us that they have their End Users' consent to set/collect cookies (or for [24]7.ai to set/collect the cookies on their behalf) and that they have the right to give such information to [24]7.ai to process on their behalf. If you have any concerns about one of our client’s right to set/collect cookies or to give us the right to do so on their behalf, please contact that client directly.
Opt-Out
Before using the [24]7.ai Platform, we agree in written agreements with our clients that they have sufficient rights, including their End Users' consent, to allow us to collect both Personal Information and Interaction Data. End Users who do not wish to have their Personal Information or Interaction Data collected should contact our client directly or visit our client’s privacy policy for guidance on opting out. Please note that End Users who clear their web browser’s cookies and then visit our client’s website again, or visit our client’s website from a different web browser, may need to re-enter their opt-out choices with our client. If you are a client and would like to update your account please contact us via your client account representative.
We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email.
Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account.
Security
The [24]7.ai Platform follows industry standards to protect the security of End Users’ Personal Information and [24]7.ai respects End Users’ choices for such information’s intended use (to the extent those choices are communicated to our clients by End Users and then onward-communicated by our clients to us). We utilize a combination of reasonable and appropriate physical, technical, and administrative safeguards to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure of End Users’ Personal Information, to maintain data accuracy of End Users’ Personal Information, and to ensure the appropriate use of End Users’ Personal Information we collect and process. [24]7.ai retains Personal Information and Interaction Data only as required or permitted by local law and while it has a legitimate business purpose. In addition, [24]7.ai uses standard security protocols, and mechanisms to exchange the transmission of sensitive Personal Information such as credit card details and login credentials. End Users submit sensitive Personal Information such as their credit card number in the [24]7.ai Platform via functionality which limits the sensitive data from being persisted by [24]7.ai and is encrypted using transport layer security (“TLS”) technology.
Privacy Shield Principles
End Users' information may be stored, processed and/or accessed in the United States or in any other country in which [24]7.ai or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities. By using the [24]7.ai Platform, our clients have promised us that such End Users have consented to any such transfer of information outside of the End Users' home country.
We and our wholly owned subsidiaries such as, 24/7 Customer Private Limited, Voxify, LLC, Tellme Networks, Inc., and 24/7 Inc., participate in and have certified compliance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework.

In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request.
Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint, you may invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.
Accuracy of Personal Information
[24]7.ai has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes. [24]7.ai endeavors to maintain accurate Personal Information at all times but ultimately is reliant on its clients for the accuracy of Personal Information. If an End User requires updates to her/his Personal Information or requests their data be deleted/deactivated in the [24]7.ai Platform, the End User should request such changes directly through our applicable client, and [24]7.ai will make reasonable efforts to incorporate such changes, or respond to requests for access, deletion, correction, amendment, restriction in the [24]7.ai Platform within 30 days.
Onward Transfer

Therefore, [24]7.ai may transfer End Users’ Personal Information and Interaction Data on to its affiliates and/or subcontractors worldwide for the purpose of further processing or storage, and/or may transfer data within its control to various geographies as part of its own processing efforts. [24]7.ai will not sell, rent, transfer or lease an End User's Personal Information to any third party except with the End User's direct consent, whether provided directly or relayed to us by our clients Transfers to any third parties are covered by the provisions in this Policy regarding notice and choice and the service agreements with our Clients; the transfer is to other [24]7.ai entities and/or business partners who are acting on behalf of [24]7.ai for the uses described in this policy; or the transfer is required by law or court order, and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our website.
