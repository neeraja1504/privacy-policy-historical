Inter-State Studio & Publishing Co. Privacy Policy
Last Updated : May 23, 2018
By accessing and using the Site, you agree to be bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy.  This Privacy Policy is between you and Inter-State Studio & Publishing Co. (“Company”, “us” or “we”).  Inter-State Studio & Publishing Co. is a trusted provider of photographic products and services to communities, schools and families throughout the United States.  At Inter-State, we are sensitive to the privacy concerns of visitors to our websites.  Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect, disclose or otherwise handle information collected from users of our website, located at https://www.inter-state.com/ , and any other online features, tools and resources we provide (collectively, the “Site”).
We keep this Privacy Policy posted on the Site, and you should review it frequently as it may change from time to time.  ANY CHANGES WILL BE EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY UPON THE POSTING OF THE REVISED PRIVACY POLICY. BY ACCESSING AND USING OUR SITE, YOU ARE CONSENTING TO THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY.
Please remember that this Privacy Policy applies only to information collected by our Site. We are not responsible for the privacy of any information you reveal or post in any public forum (e.g., message board, blog, chatroom or social media site).
What information do we collect from the people that visit our Site?
Our Site has the ability to collect two types of information from and about you: personally identifiable information (“PII”) and non-personally identifiable information.  We collect this information: (a) directly from you when you provide it to us; and/or (b) automatically as you navigate through our Site.
Personally Identifiable Information : Our definition of PII includes any information that may be used to specifically identify you, such as your name, postal and email addresses, phone number, or credit card information.  In certain circumstances, we may request, allow or otherwise provide you an opportunity to submit your PII in connection with some aspect of our Site. When ordering or registering on our Site, as appropriate, you may be asked to enter your name, email address, mailing address, phone number, credit card information or other details to help you with your experience. We may also ask for your child’s name, their teacher or coach, and grade or team.  Certain information may not be PII when standing alone (e.g., your age), but may become so when combined with other information (e.g., your age and name). Whether or not you provide this information is your choice; however, in many instances this type of information is required to participate in the particular activity or service, realize a benefit we may offer, or gain access to certain content through our Site.
Non-Personal Information: Our definition of non-personal information is any information that does not specifically identify you. Non-personal information can include certain PII that has been de-identified; that is, information that no longer reveals your specific identity. We obtain non-personal information about you from information that you provide us, either separately or together with your PII. This information can include, among other things: your IP address or other unique identifiers that are automatically assigned to your computer, mobile or other device used to access the Site; the type of browser you are using (e.g., Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, etc.); the third party website from which your visit originated; the operating system you are using (e.g., Vista, Windows XP, Mac OS, etc.); the domain name of your Internet service provider; the search terms you use on our Site; the specific areas within our Site that you visit; information collected through cookies, pixel tags and other technologies and the time of day and duration of your visits.
When you submit information to us through any of our Site, you should be aware that your information is transmitted across the Internet and that no method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. Although we take reasonable security measures to protect your information when we receive it, you also need to ensure you take appropriate steps to protect your information.
If you disclose any PII relating to other people to us or to our service providers in connection with the services, you represent that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
When do we collect information?
We and our service providers collect information from you when you register on our Site, place an order, subscribe to a newsletter, respond to a survey, fill out a form, or enter information on our Site.  We may also collect certain non-personal information from you when you access or navigate through our Site.  In addition, we may receive information about you from other third party sources, including but not limited to, your school, and social media platforms.  In addition, if you elect to connect your social media account to your account on the Site, certain PII from your social media account will be shared with us, which may include PII that is part of your profile.  We also collect PII from offline resources, such as when you attend one of our trade shows.
How do we use your information?
We and our service providers may use information about you when you register, make a purchase, respond to a survey or marketing communication, access or navigate through the Site, or use certain other Site features.
The information collected through our Site is generally used to fulfill our legitimate business interests including: fulfilling your requests for our products and services, to respond to your inquiries about our offerings, to personalize your online experience, and in other ways naturally associated with the circumstances in which you provided the information.  We may also use this information to later contact you for a variety of reasons, such as customer service, offering you other products or services that we believe may be of interest to you, to send administrative information to you, such as changes to our terms, conditions and policies, or to communicate with you about content or other information you have posted or shared with us via our Site. We may use the non-personally identifiable information that we receive in a variety of ways, including but not limited to administering the Site, helping us analyze site traffic, understanding customer needs and trends, carrying out targeted promotional activities, improving the quality of the pages that make up our Site, gathering broad demographic information, and  improving our Site. We may use non-personal information about you by itself or aggregate it with information we have obtained from others. We may share non-personal information about you with our affiliated companies and/or third parties to achieve these objectives and others.  We may share your PII with affiliated companies and third parties including, but not limited to, our co-promotional partners, list rental/purchasing agencies, contractors, vendors, consultants and professional advisors to the extent necessary for them to perform services on our behalf, and persons or entities with whom we have marketing, business, or other relationships, including but not limited to yearbook publishers.  In addition, by connecting your account on the Site with your social media account, you authorize us to share information with your social media account provider, and you understand that the use of the information we share will be governed by the social media provider’s privacy policy.  In response to a legal process or law enforcement request, including requests made by authorities outside your country of residence we may disclose PII. We also may disclose PII if we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or as otherwise required by law, which may include laws outside your country of residence.
In addition to the foregoing, we may use your PII or collected non-personal information as follows:
To provide you with information or services or process transactions that you have requested or agreed to receive, including to send you electronic newsletters, or to provide you with special offers or promotional materials on behalf of us or third parties;
To process your registration with the Site, including verifying your information is valid;
To enable you to participate in a variety of the Site’s features, such as online or mobile entry sweepstakes, contests, surveys or other promotions;
To contact you with regard to your use of the Site and, in our discretion, changes to the Site and related policies;
For inclusion in our data analytics;
To protect or defend our legal rights or property, our Site, or other users; and
For purposes of disclosure or transfer to a third party in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings).
Information from your Mobile Device
We may also use technologies, such as location based information, to provide you with tailored information and features as you use our Site.  When you access the Site on your mobile device (“Mobile Device”), we may obtain information from your Mobile Device about the type of Mobile Device you are using. We may use this information to notify you of features and products that may be available on your Mobile Device. Certain features may require our collection of the phone number of your Mobile Device. We may link that phone number to the Mobile Device identification information, but will not use that number for telemarketing. In addition, some mobile network providers (“Mobile Provider”) in the U.S. are required to use technology that tracks the physical location of Mobile Devices that use their service. Depending on your Mobile Provider and Mobile Device, we may automatically receive this information. If we begin to offer services that use this tracking (“pinpointing”) information, we will obtain your consent (an opt-in) before using the information. After obtaining such consent, we may use and store this information to provide location-based services, including location-targeted advertising.   Most Mobile Devices provide users with the ability to disable location services. These controls are usually located in the Mobile Device's settings menu. If you have questions about how to disable your Mobile Device's location services, we recommend you contact your Mobile Provider or your Mobile Device manufacturer.
Picture Day & Yearbook Notifications
When you sign up for Picture Day or Yearbook Notifications through the Site, your email address will be used only for notification of important events and dates (such as when your school’s picture date is occurring, or when pictures are available to order). We will not use your information provided for Picture Day or Yearbook Notifications for any other marketing activity.
How do we protect information?
Our Site is scanned on a regular basis for potential security vulnerabilities in order to make your visit to our Site as safe as possible.
Furthermore, your personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. In addition, all credit information you supply is encrypted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.
At all of the appropriate stages, we implement a variety of security measures when a user places an order or enters, submits, or accesses their information to maintain the safety of your personal information.
All payment transactions are processed through a gateway provider and are never stored or processed on our servers.
Credit cards are accepted, but the credit card account information is never stored on Inter-State systems. We partner with both PayPal and Stripe, two of the largest and most trusted names in the online payment processing business, to process payments. If you wish to make a payment, your information may be collected by such vendors and will be subject to the respective vendor’s privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy.
Please be advised that while we strive to protect your PII and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us online and are not responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your PII.
Do we use 'cookies'?
Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. For instance, we use cookies to help us remember and process the items in your shopping cart. They are also used to help us understand your preferences based on previous or current site activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services. We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about Site traffic and Site interaction so that we can offer better Site experiences and tools in the future. We use cookies to:
Remember and process the items in the shopping cart.
Understand and save user preferences for future visits.
Keep track of advertisements.
Compile aggregate data about Site traffic and Site interactions in order to offer better Site experiences and tools in the future. We may also use trusted third-party services that track this information on our behalf.
You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser (like Chrome or Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser's Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.
If you disable cookies, some features will be disabled. Your site experience could be less efficient and some of our services will not function properly.  However, you can still place orders.
Other Information Collection Methods We May Use
In addition to cookies, a few of the other information collection methods we may use include the following:
Web Beacons.  “Web beacons” are small graphic images or other web programming code that may be included in our Site pages. Web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of users of our Site pages.  Unlike cookies, which are typically stored on your computer or mobile device’s hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on web pages. Web beacons or similar technologies help us better manage content on our Site by informing us what content is effective, counting the number of users of the Site, monitoring how users navigate the Site, or counting how many e-mails, articles or links  were actually opened or viewed.
Embedded Scripts. An “embedded script” is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Site, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your computer, mobile or other device from our server or a third party service provider.
Web Traffic and Web Performance Analytics.  We may also collect information using a variety of reports from web traffic and web performance analytics companies to improve our Site. This information allows us to better understand users of the Site, and to customize the Site while also tracking our success at reaching new audiences. This Privacy Policy does not govern the ability of any third party analytics company to use and share information collected by such company.
IP Addresses. An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer, mobile or other computing device whenever you are surfing the Internet. Web servers (computers that "serve up" web pages) automatically identify your computer or other computing device by its IP address. When users request pages from our website, our servers may log their IP addresses. We may collect IP addresses for the following purposes, among others: system administration, to report non-personal aggregate information to others, and to track the use of our Site.  We may derive your approximate location from your IP address.
Email Communications. If you send us an email with questions or comments, we may use your PII to respond to your questions or comments, and we may save your questions or comments for future reference. For security reasons, we do not recommend that you send non-public personal information, such as passwords, credit card information, social security numbers, or bank account information, to us by email. In certain instances, we may provide you with the option to set your preferences for receiving email communications from us; that is, agree to some communications but not others. We reserve the right to send you transactional emails such as customer service communications.
Third-party Disclosure
Except as otherwise expressly disclosed in this Privacy Policy, we will never sell or trade your PII or information about your buying history.
Third-party Services
This Privacy Policy does not address, and we are not responsible for the privacy, information or other practices of any third parties, including any third party operating any website or service to which the services link.  The inclusion of a link on the services does not imply endorsement of the linked site or service by us or by our affiliates.
In addition, we are not responsible for the information, collection, use, disclosure or security policies or practices of other organizations, such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Apple, Google, Microsoft, RIM or any other app developer, app provider, social media platform provider, operating system provider, wireless service provider or device manufacturer, including with respect to any PII you disclose to other organizations through or in connection with mobile apps.  .

California Online Privacy Protection Act
CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy.
