It is necessary in order for us to fulfill a contract that we have with you;
It is required in our legitimate interests;
It is required in order for us to comply with our legal obligations; or
It is permitted because you have provided your consent to us.
Where we need to collect information by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you, and you fail to provide that information when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you (in this case, to provide you with the Services). In this case, we may have to cancel the Services, but we will notify you if this is the case at the time.
Necessary for Us to Fulfill Our Contract with You
We collect, store and use your information including your name, e-mail address, payment details, postal address, and information about how you use and access the Services because it is necessary in order to provide the Services requested by you pursuant to the contract made between you and us when you agreed to our . This includes:
Making the Services available to you;
Providing any Services that you request;
Administering the Services;
Providing personalized recommendations and content within the Services by collecting information about you in order to build a profile of your preferences based on your activity when you use the Services.

Servicing and account administration requirements such as where we need to contact you for reasons related to the Services (for example, where we need to send you a password reminder, or to notify you about Services updates or amendments to our Terms of Use, Cookie Policy, or this privacy policy); and
Where you are purchasing Services from us, processing your payment (including but not limited to using third party service providers to process such payment).
If you have entered into a promotion or competition on the Services, then, pursuant to the promotion and/or competition terms and conditions provided to you at the time of entry, we will use your contact details (such as e-mail address or postal address) to administer your entry and inform you if you have won a prize.
Our Legitimate Interests
Sometimes, our use of your information is for purposes which are ancillary to the provision of the Services. In those circumstances, we believe we have a legitimate interest in handling your information and believe that the benefits of this storage and use of your information will outweigh any potential impact on you and not unduly prejudice your rights or freedoms. The relevant circumstances are:
Detecting and preventing fraud;
Keeping our Services, products, and IT systems secure;
Ensuring that our own processes, procedures, and systems are as efficient as possible;
Analyzing and enhancing the information that we collect;
Analyzing your video consumption, playback, and general viewing habits in order to understand viewership and update and improve our Services, including but not limited to our content, features, scheduling, technology and products;
Determining the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns and advertising;
Using IP addresses and device identifiers to identify the location of users and block any unauthorized users;
Dealing with your inquiries and requests (for example if you were to call customer services to ask for help and assistance then we would need to process your contact details);
Suggesting similar products to you that you may be interested in and to understand which products appeal to our customers;
If you have paid for your use of the Services, for marketing purposes, contacting you by email with products and Services which we think may interest you (for more information, please see the MARKETING section below); and
Where you have opted out of our marketing or objected to receiving e-mails from us, keeping records of your preferences to ensure that we do not contact you if you have asked us not to.
If we rely on our (or another person’s) legitimate interests for using your information, we will undertake a balancing test to ensure that our (or the other person’s) legitimate interests are not outweighed by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms which require protection of the information. You can ask us for information on this balancing test by using the contact details in the CONTACT section.
When You Have Provided Consent to Us
Where you have given us your consent (either by paying for use of a Service and/or providing consent otherwise), we will contact you by e-mail and/or text message with products and Services which we think may interest you. For more information, please see the MARKETING section below.
If we rely on your consent for us to use your information in a particular way, but you later change your mind, you may withdraw your consent by contacting our Data Protection Officer at dpo@discovery.com and we will stop doing so.
For Legal Reasons
We will use your information in order to comply with our legal obligations. These obligations include:
If you have a paid subscription to use the Services and live in the European Union (the “EU”), we are legally required to allow you and you are legally entitled to watch the Services when you’re visiting another country in the EU provided that we have verified your country of residence. We verify your country of residence using your IP address and payment information or, if you are a resident in Sweden, by your billing address;
Us complying with our legal obligations; and
If we are asked by regulatory bodies or law enforcement agencies to share your information with them.
Anonymous Data
We collect anonymized details about visitors to our website for the purposes of aggregate statistics or reporting purposes. However, no individual will be identifiable from the anonymized details we collect for these purposes, and we are free to use and share such anonymized information in our discretion.
Marketing
Marketing from Us
We may use your name, contact details, technical, usage and profile information to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services, and offers may be relevant for you.
You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us, or purchased a subscription for the Services from us, or if you provided us with your details when you entered a competition or registered for a promotion, and, in each case, you have not opted out from receiving that marketing.
Third-Party Marketing
For those EU-based users only, we will get your express opt-in consent before we share your information with any company outside our group of companies for marketing purposes.
Opting Out
We want to provide you with choices regarding certain information uses, particularly around marketing and advertising. You can change your choices at any time by logging into the website and checking or unchecking relevant boxes to adjust your marketing preferences in your settings. Depending on the type of user experience, we have established certain information control mechanisms such as accessing and adjusting account settings, or by following the opt-out links on any marketing message sent to you, or by contacting us at any time, or by emailing our Data Protection Officer at dpo@discovery.com.
You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any time. You can change your choices at any time by logging into the website and checking or unchecking relevant boxes to adjust your marketing preferences in your settings. Depending on the type of user experience, we have established certain information control mechanisms such as accessing and adjusting account settings, or by following the opt-out links on any marketing message sent to you, or by contacting us at any time, or by emailing our Data Protection Officer at dpo@discovery.com.
Where you opt out of receiving these marketing messages, this will not apply to information provided to us as a result of a product/service purchase, product/service experience, or other transactions. Therefore, you will continue to receive essential messages about the functionality and/or administration of our Services (for example, as mentioned above, where we need to send you a password reminder, to notify you about Services updates, or amendments to legal terms).
Third-Party Advertising Companies
We want to make sure that our advertising and marketing is relevant and interesting to you and our other users. To achieve this, we use third-party advertising and technology companies to serve ads and/or provide aggregated information to assist in serving ads when you visit or use our Services. This includes third party technology companies which collect information about you in order to build a profile of your preferences based on your activities when you visit or use our Services and other sites and services. We also use these companies to automatically collect information from you when you use our Services in order to help us identify the ads that are served to you and what you do after seeing those ads. In addition, we also share information with providers of web analytics tools, such as Google Analytics, which we use to analyze your use of the Services.
These third-party advertising companies collect, store, and use information by integrating cookies and other tracking software on our Services. Please see our  for further information. In some cases these third parties will also use the information that they collect for their own purposes, for example they may: aggregate your information with other information they hold and use this to inform advertising related services provided to other clients; and work with other advertising companies and share your information with such companies as part of the process.
Please see our for more information on the third party advertising companies which collect, use, and store information about you, and the use of cookies and other tracking technologies on our Services. From our Cookie Policy you can also find out how to exercise control over this collection and use of information. If you choose to restrict or prevent tracking for these purposes then the advertising you see when you visit or use our Services will no longer be tailored to your preferences.
We might also share your information with social media or other similar platforms, so that you and other people can see relevant content on that platform. For example, we may use the Facebook Custom Audiences service and share your email address in a protected format with Facebook so that we can: include you in a custom audience that we will serve relevant advertising content to on Facebook; or create an audience of other Facebook users based on the information in your Facebook profile.
How We Share Your Information And who we share it with

Third-party service providers:  When we share information with third-party service companies to facilitate or to provide certain services on our behalf. This will include:

These companies are authorized to use your information only as necessary to provide these Services to us.

If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified afterwards via e-mail and/or a prominent notice on our Services of any change in ownership or uses of your information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your information.
International Transfers
If you are located outside of the United States then we will transfer information that we collect from you to third party data processors located in countries that are outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”) (including to the US) or to members of our group of companies in connection with the above purposes. Please be aware that countries which are outside the EEA may not offer the same level of data protection as the EEA, although our collection, storage and use of your information will continue to be governed by this privacy policy.

By using the Services or providing us with any information, you consent to this transfer and processing of your information in the US.

Cookie and Similar Technologies
Technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by us and our partners, affiliates, or analytics or service providers. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the Services, tracking users’ movements around the Services and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.
We use cookies, for example, to remember users’ settings (e.g. language preference) and for authentication. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our Services, but your ability to use some features or areas of our Services may be limited.
Please read more about how we use cookies and what information is collected using cookies in our Cookie Policy here.
PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS POLICY DOES NOT COVER THE COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION BY SUCH ADVERTISING COMPANIES.
Security
While we take appropriate technical and organizational measures to safeguard the information that you provide to us, no transmission over the Internet can ever be guaranteed secure. Consequently, please note that we cannot guarantee the security of any information that you transfer over the Internet to us.
We are committed to protecting your information using appropriate technical and operational measures such as access controls that restrict and manage the ways in which your information is stored and handled.
Data Retention
We will retain information for as long as we need to use it for the reasons set out in the privacy policy and will delete it after that time except where we need to keep any information to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce our agreements.
We may delete your information (including any account that you set up to use on the Services) if you do not use the Services in a certain time period pursuant to the specific Service.
In some circumstances, we may anonymize your information (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
Your Rights
Depending on the local laws that are applicable to you, you may have certain rights in relation to your “personal information” or “personal data” as such terms are defined by such applicable laws. If you would like further information in relation to these or would like to exercise any of them, please contact our Data Protection Officer at dpo@discovery.com at any time. Specifically, you may have the right to request that we:
Provide access to any personal information we hold about you;
Update any of your personal information which is out of date or incorrect;
Delete any personal information which we are holding about you;
Restrict the way that we process your personal information;
Prevent the processing of your personal information for direct-marketing purposes;
Provide your personal information to a third-party provider of services;
Provide you with a copy of any personal information which we hold about you; or
Consider any valid objections which you have to our use of your personal information.
We will consider all such requests and provide our response within a reasonable period (and in any event within any time period required by applicable law). Please note, however, that certain personal information may be exempt from such requests in certain circumstances.
If an exception applies, we will tell you this when responding to your request. We may request you provide us with information necessary to confirm your identity before responding to any request you make.
If we delete any personal information which we are holding about you, this deletion may only relate to the Services and not any other service provided by us in other jurisdictions. You should make requests for each account that you may have set up to access the Services or any other service provided by us.
If you are a California resident, please see the “Additional Privacy Information for California Residents” section immediately below for more information about making requests under CA law.
Additional Privacy Information for California Residents
If you are a California resident, California law requires us to provide you with some additional information regarding the “personal information” (as defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”)) we and our parent company, Discovery Inc., collect from and about you, and your rights with respect to your personal information.  You can find this additional information in our California Privacy Notice.
Additional Privacy Information for Nevada Residents
Under Nevada law, Nevada residents who have purchased goods or services from us may opt out of the “sale” of “covered information” (as such terms are defined under Nevada law) for monetary consideration to a person for that person to license or sell such information to additional persons.  As discussed above, we share your information with certain third parties that we believe can provide you with offers and promotions for products and services of interest to you.  In some circumstances, this sharing may qualify as a sale under Nevada law. If you are a Nevada resident who has purchased goods or services from us, you may submit a request to opt out of such activity emailing us at privacy_policy@discovery.com.  Please note we may take reasonable steps to verify your identity and the authenticity of the request.
Third Party Sites
The Services contain links and pages to other websites operated by third parties. Please note that this privacy policy applies only to the information that we collect through the Services and we cannot be responsible for information that third parties may collect, store and use through their website. You should always read the privacy policy of each website you visit carefully.
Dispute Resolution
In the event of any controversy, claim or dispute (“dispute”) related to or arising out of your use of the Services, other than disputes related to or involving our intellectual property or our licensed intellectual or proprietary rights, you and MTG mutually agree to the following dispute resolution procedure:
The parties will first attempt in good faith to resolve any dispute by informal negotiation. The informal negotiation period will begin when the party asserting the dispute sends a written notice to the other party describing the facts and circumstances of the dispute. If, after sixty (60) days from the date the notice of dispute is sent, the parties have been unable to resolve the dispute, either party may commence binding arbitration. The parties may agree to extend the informal dispute resolution period by mutual written agreement.
If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute through informal negotiation, you and MTG agree that exclusive jurisdiction for the dispute shall be binding arbitration before one arbitrator to be mutually agreed upon by both parties. If the parties cannot agree on the selection of an Arbitrator, they shall each select one Arbitrator from the list of qualified JAMS arbitrators and those two Arbitrators shall select the person who shall serve as the Arbitrator for such dispute. Arbitration shall be initiated in the New York, N.Y., area and shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures. Judgment on any potential award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. BY USING THE SITES, YOU ARE HEREBY GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO LITIGATE A DISPUTE IN COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY. Unless the arbitrator concludes that the arbitration was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, we will pay all filing, JAMS, and arbitrator’s fees and expenses.
ALL DISPUTES SHALL BE RESOLVED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. Neither party shall have the right to have a dispute heard as a class action and no arbitration or proceeding can be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to the proceeding.
Choice of Law; Choice of Forum
This privacy policy has been made in and shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any conflict of law principles.
The parties acknowledge that this privacy policy evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the provision in the preceding paragraph with respect to applicable substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of this privacy policy shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16).
By using the Sites, you agree that the exclusive jurisdiction for any dispute not subject to the arbitration provision discussed above shall be the state and federal courts located in New York.
Changes to this Privacy Policy
Please check back regularly to keep informed of updates to this privacy policy. Where we make significant changes to this privacy policy, and we have your e-mail address, we will send you notification of the changes.

B.     California Information & Deletion Rights
If you are a California resident, the CCPA allows you to make certain requests about your personal information. Specifically, the CCPA allows you to request us to:
Inform you about the categories of personal information we collect or disclose about you; the categories of sources of such information, the business or commercial purpose for collecting your personal information, and the categories of third parties with whom we share/disclose personal information;
Provide access to and/or a copy of certain personal information we hold about you;
Delete certain personal information we have about you; and
Provide you with information about the financial incentives that we offer to you, if any.
Please note that certain information may be exempt from such requests under California law.  For example, we need certain information in order to provide the Services to you.
Verification: We will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before responding to a request, which may include, at a minimum, depending on the sensitivity of the information you are requesting and the type of request you are making, verifying your name, e-mail address, and physical address.
You are also permitted to designate an authorized agent to submit certain requests on your behalf.  In order for an authorized agent to be verified, you must provide the authorized agent with signed, written permission to make such requests or a power of attorney.  We may also follow up with you to verify your identity before processing the authorized agent’s request.
If you would like further information regarding your legal rights under California law or would like to exercise any of them, please submit your request using the following intake form:
California Information & Deletion Requests
If you prefer, you may contact us at the following toll-free phone number to make your request: +1-866-324-3637.
C.     Notice of Right to Opt-Out of Sale of Personal Information
California residents may opt out of the “sale” of their personal information.  Under the CCPA, “sale” is broadly defined to mean the sharing of personal information with third parties who are not acting as our service providers or who are otherwise not restricted from using data only on our behalf or pursuant to an applicable CCPA exception.
In some circumstances, we may share certain of your information with third parties to provide you with offers, promotions, and opportunities that may be of interest to you, which may be considered a “sale” under the CCPA.  Under the CCPA, “sale” may also include allowing third parties to “collect” certain information, such as IP address, and/or browsing behavior, through cookies and similar technologies, to deliver targeted advertising on the Services or other services.  Advertising, including targeted advertising, enables us to provide you certain content for free and allows us to provide you offers relevant to you.
If you would like to opt out of our use of your information for such purposes that are considered a “sale” under California law, you may do so as outlined on the following page:   Do Not Sell My Personal Information.  Please note that we do not knowingly sell the personal information of minors under 16 years of age without legally-required affirmative authorization.
The CCPA further provides you with the right to not be discriminated against (as provided for in applicable law) for exercising your access, deletion or sale opt out rights.
D.    California “Shine the Light” Disclosure
If a company shares “personal information” (as defined in California’s “Shine the Light” law, Civil Code § 1798.83) with third parties for their direct marketing purposes (e.g., to send offers and information that may be of interest to you), California law requires either providing a mechanism by which consumers can obtain more information about such sharing over the prior calendar year, or providing a mechanism by which consumers can opt out of such sharing.  As discussed above, we provide an opt out for this sharing.  If you are a California resident and would like to opt out of sharing pursuant to this law, please use the “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” link above.
