Information Collection and Submission
IB collects information to provide better services for all of its users. When you visit the Site, you acknowledge that you may be providing IB with two specific types of information: (i) information that you provide which personally identifies you or your business (“ Personally Identifiable Information ”) and (ii) information that you provide, or that we collect as you interact with the Site, which does not personally identify you or your business (“ Site-Use Information ”).
Personally Identifiable Information. Throughout the Site, you may voluntarily submit Personally Identifiable Information that personally identifies you. For example, the Site may ask you to voluntarily submit Personally Identifiable Information if you register for the Site. Personally Identifiable Information includes, but is not limited to, your (a) name, (b) company’s name, (c) department, (d) physical address, (e) phone number, (f) fax number, (g) e-mail address, and (h) billing information.
Site-Use Information. To help IB tailor the Site to the needs and interests of the Site’s visitors, IB may collect various types of Site-Use Information that do not identify you personally. For example, when you visit the Site, IB’s server, through the use of tracking devices, may collect Site-Use Information pertaining to you, including, but not limited to, the length of time you spend on the Site, which pages you visited within the Site, which site you visited before coming to the Site, and which site you accessed when you left the Site.
Cookies
IB uses various technologies to collect and store information when you visit our site, this includes the use of “cookie,” which is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record keeping purposes, or similar technologies to identify your browser or device. IB reserves the right to place these cookies in the browser files of your computer. You can configure your browser to refuse cookies, or to warn you before a cookie is placed. If you disable cookies, some parts of the Site may not function properly or at all.
Do Not Track
At this time sites on the IB Network do not recognize automated browser signals regarding tracking mechanisms, which may include ‘do not track’ instructions. However, you can change your privacy preferences regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies through your browser. You may set your browser to accept all cookies, block certain or all cookies, or require your consent before a cookie is placed in your browser.
Security
IB works hard to protect its users from unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, destruction or disclosure of information we hold. IB uses commercially reasonable administrative, technical, human, and physical measures to protect your information in IB’s possession against loss and theft and unauthorized use, disclosure, or modification. However, IB cannot guarantee that any electronic commerce is totally secure. For example, IB has no control over the information collected by your Internet service provider or your employer (if the Site is made available to you through your employer). Any such third party that collects your information may use the information in accordance with its terms and conditions of use (and related privacy policies), which may be different from this Policy. IB is not responsible for any information collected by such third parties and/or how such information is used or maintained. Neither any third party nor IB has the authority to make any representations or commitments on behalf of the other.

Portions of the Site may be hosted on our computer servers in the United States. If you are accessing the Site from outside of the United States, any Personally Identifiable Information collected through the Site may be transferred to the United States or other countries whose privacy laws may be different from those of your home country.
