The Interactive Brokers Group affiliates (collectively, "IBKR"), are committed to protecting the privacy of Personal Information, including Personal Information related to individuals who may be customers, employees, agents, job applicants or others inside or outside of IBKR.

We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy carefully.
This Policy is based on the privacy and data protection principles common to the countries in which we operate. This Policy is intended to summarize IBKR's data protection practices generally and to advise our customers, prospective customers, job applicants, website visitors and other third parties about IBKR's privacy policies that may be applicable to them.
This Policy is specifically addressed to those who provide Personal Information to IBKR or who visit or use IBKR's websites, trading platforms, software application and social media sites.

In order for you to utilize our services, you will provide us with your Personal Information entirely voluntarily. In most circumstances IBKR cannot take action without utilizing certain of your Personal Information, for example, because this Personal Information is required to process your instructions or orders or provide you with access to our services or marketing materials.

IBKR generally requires these service providers to enter into confidentiality agreements with IBKR that limit their use of the information that they receive. Such agreements prohibit the service provider from using IBKR customer information that they receive other than to carry out the purposes for which the information was disclosed. If required by law, IBKR will retain control over and will remain responsible for your Personal Information and will use appropriate safeguards to ensure the integrity and security of your Personal Information when engaging service providers;

We may also use aggregated Personal Information and statistics for the purpose of monitoring website usage in order to help us develop our website and our services.
Otherwise, we will only disclose your Personal Information when you direct us or give us permission to do so, when we are allowed or required by applicable law or regulations or judicial or official request to do so, or as required to investigate actual or suspected fraudulent or criminal activities.
Personal Information about other people that you provide to us
If you provide Personal Information to us about someone else (such as one of your directors or employees or someone with whom you have business dealings), you must ensure that you are entitled to disclose that Personal Information to us and that, without our taking any further steps, we may collect, use and disclose that Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.

For Personal Information subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 ("GDPR") we may transfer your Personal Information outside the EEA for the Permitted Purposes as described above. This may include countries that do not provide the same level of protection as the laws of your home country (for example, the laws within the EEA or the United States). We will ensure that any such international transfers are made subject to appropriate or suitable safeguards if required by the GDPR or other relevant laws. You may contact us at any time using the contact details below if you would like further information on such safeguards.
With respect to persons covered by GDPR, in case Personal Information is transferred to countries or territories outside of the EEA that are not recognized by the European Commission as offering an adequate level of data protection, we have put in place appropriate data transfer mechanisms to ensure Personal Information is protected.

We will not be responsible for any losses arising from any inaccurate, inauthentic, deficient or incomplete Personal Information that you provide to us.
How long do we retain your Personal Information?
We retain your Personal Information in an identifiable form in accordance with our internal policies which establish general standards and procedures regarding the retention, handling and disposition of your Personal Information. Personal Information is retained for as long as necessary to meet legal, regulatory and business requirements. Retention periods may be extended if we are required to preserve your Personal Information in connection with litigation, investigations and proceedings.
Further rights for persons or information covered by GDPR
With respect to EEA residents and where your Personal Information is processed by an IBKR Entity established in the EEA ("Covered Individuals"), you have a number of legal rights under GDPR in relation to the Personal Information that we hold about you. These rights include:

We have designated a Data Protection Officer ("DPO") to enhance and promote compliance with and understanding of privacy and data protection principles. If you wish to do any of the above please send an email to dpo@interactivebrokers.co.uk.
We may request that you prove your identity by providing us with a copy of a valid means of identification in order for us to comply with our security obligations and to prevent unauthorized disclosure of data. We reserve the right to charge you a reasonable administrative fee for any manifestly unfounded or excessive requests concerning your access to your data and for any additional copies of the Personal Information you request from us.
We will consider any requests or complaints that we receive and provide you with a response in a timely manner. If you are not satisfied with our response, you may take your complaint to the relevant privacy regulator. We will provide you with details of your relevant regulator upon request.
