Privacy Policy – Intertrust Technologies
**Effective as of June 24, 2019 **
Intertrust Technologies Corporation and its affiliated companies (“Intertrust”) provide this Privacy Policy in order to describe our practices regarding the information we collect, use, and share when you interact with our websites, products, and email communications (the “Services”). Intertrust offers a wide range of products and services related to computer security, digital rights management, online advertising, data aggregation and distribution, and data analytics. Please read the product-specific details in this Policy, which provide additional information about some of our products.
By using the Services, you consent to the collection and use of information as described in this Privacy Policy. Your use of the Services is also governed by our Terms of Service.
1. When This Privacy Policy Applies
This Policy applies to our websites, products, emails we send, as well as the information we collect when you interact with us through social media or other websites and online services. It does not apply to non-Intertrust websites and mobile applications that may link to the Services or be linked to or from the Services; please review the privacy policies on those websites and applications directly to understand their privacy practices.
We may make changes to this Policy from time to time. We will post any changes, and such changes will become effective when they are posted. Your continued use of our Services following the posting of any changes will mean you accept those changes.
2. What Information We Collect
Information That You Provide
When you become or express interest in becoming a client of Intertrust, we ask you to provide certain information to allow us to communicate with you and provide customized products and services. This information typically includes your name or email address, demographic information (your age, gender, ZIP code or similar information), business information (including your job title, employer, and business contact information), and certain information about your interests and preferences. We will also collect payment information (typically, credit card account information) if you choose to purchase products or services through our websites.
The Services may also provide you the opportunity to participate and post content publicly in forums, through interactive features and through other communication functionality (“ Community Forums ”). You may choose, through such features or otherwise, to submit or post questions, comments, suggestions, indications of interest in the content or other content, (collectively, “ User Content ”). When you create User Content in a Community Forum, that content is displayed publicly. Your name, along with any information you have disclosed in your profile, will be accessible by other users of the forum as well as the general public.
Information Third Parties Provide About You
We may receive information about you from third parties. For example, we may supplement the information we collect with outside records in order to provide you with information, services or products you have requested, to tailor content, to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you, and for other purposes.
Information We Collect Automatically
When you interact with the Services, as either a client, direct visitor to our website, or indirect user through a product employed by a third-party application, certain information about your use of our Services is automatically collected. This information includes, as applicable, the IP address or other unique identifier for any computer, mobile phone, or other device used to access our Services, the browser and operating system you are using, the URL or advertisement that referred you to our Services, any search terms you entered into a search engine that led you to our Services, the areas within our Services that you visited, and the time of day you visited our Services, among other information.

Much of this information is collected through cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies, as well as through your web browser or device (e.g., IP address, MAC address, browser version, etc.). The tracking technologies employed when you use our Services may be first-party or third-party. We use cookies for the following purposes:
Strictly necessary cookies: These cookies are necessary for the website to function. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the site will not then work.
Performance cookies: These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our site. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site. If you do not allow these cookies we will not know when you have visited our site, and will not be able to monitor its performance.
Functional cookies: These cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and personalization. They may be set by us or by third party providers whose services we have added to our pages. If you do not allow these cookies then some or all of these services may not function properly.
Targeting cookies: These cookies may be set through our site by our advertising partners. They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant adverts on other sites. They do not store directly personal information, but are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device. If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising.
You can see in our Cookie Notice a detailed list of the cookies we use on our website.
You can make changes to which categories of cookies we use (with the exception of strictly necessary cookies) in our privacy preference center. However, blocking some types of cookies may impact your experience of the site.

As an alternative mechanism to control cookies you may also edit the privacy and security settings of your browser where you can refuse to accept cookies, or remove cookies. However, our privacy preference center uses a cookie to remember the choices you have made. Consequently if you delete all your cookies we won’t be able to remember your cookie preferences and you will have to update them with us again.
We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc., on our Services. Google Analytics uses cookies or other tracking technologies to help us analyze how users interact with and use the Services, compile reports on the Services’ activity, and provide other services related to our Services’ activity and usage. The technologies used by Google may collect information such as your IP address, time of visit, whether you are a return visitor, and any referring website. The Services do not use Google Analytics to gather information that personally identifies you. The information generated by Google Analytics will be transmitted to and stored by Google and will be subject to Google’s privacy policies.

4. How We Share Information with Third Parties
We may share the information collected via our Services with companies who work on our behalf to help us provide and support the Services and our products and services. This includes allowing third parties to use tracking technologies to collect information as outlined above.
We may transfer and disclose information about you to third parties in order to comply with a legal obligation; when we believe that the law requires it; at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation; to verify or enforce our Terms & Conditions or other applicable policies; to respond to an emergency; or otherwise to protect the rights, property, safety, or security of Intertrust, users of the Services, or others.
Intertrust may share your information about you with its subsidiaries and affiliates, primarily for business and operational purposes. In the event Intertrust goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, including, without limitation, during the course of any due diligence process, your information will likely be among the assets transferred.
5. Your Options Regarding Interest-Based Advertising
Interest-based advertising is the collection of information across different websites and/or different devices for the purpose of tailoring advertising based on preferences or interests know or inferred from the information collected.
Intertrust does not serve advertising on its website, but we partner with third parties to use the information you make available to us when you interact with our Services to provide you with advertising that is more relevant to you after you leave our Services. You can learn more about ad serving companies and the options available to limit their collection and use of your information by visiting the websites for the Network Advertising Initiative, the Digital Advertising Alliance, and the European Interactive Digital Advertising Initiative. Similarly, you can learn about your options to opt-out of mobile app tracking by certain advertising networks through your device settings and by resetting the advertiser ID on your Apple or Android device.
Please note that opting-out of advertising networks services does not mean that you will not receive advertising while using our Services or on other websites, nor will it prevent the receipt of interest-based advertising from third parties that do not participate in these programs. It will, however, exclude you from interest-based advertising conducted through participating networks, as provided by their policies and choice mechanisms. If you delete your cookies, you may also delete your opt-out preferences.
Your browser or device may include “Do Not Track” functionality. At this time, Intertrust does not respond to browser “Do Not Track” signals.
6. Security
Intertrust takes commercially reasonable steps to help protect and secure the information it collects and stores about its users. However, please remember that no data storage or data transmission is guaranteed to be 100% secure. Thus, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, Intertrust cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. You use our services and provide us with your information at your own risk.
