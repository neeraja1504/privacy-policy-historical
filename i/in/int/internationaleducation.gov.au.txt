The Department of Education and Training, its employees, contractors and agents (collectively, the department) is subject to the Privacy Act 1988 (the Privacy Act) and to the requirements of the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) contained in the Privacy Act.
We also adhere to the Guidelines for Federal and ACT Government Websites, issued by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner.
Our privacy policy has been developed in accordance with APP 1 and embodies our commitment to protecting personal information. The complete privacy policy can be found here:

Information we collect and why we use it
We are responsible for national policies and programs that help Australians access quality and affordable childcare; early childhood education; school education; post-school, higher education; international education and academic research, through:
efficient national program management;
effective working relationships with state and territory governments, non-government education authorities and providers, universities and other providers of community groups and other stakeholders;

policy advice and other support to the Minister.
Generally, we collect personal information in order to properly and efficiently carry out one or more of our functions. We only use personal information for the purpose(s) for which it was given to us and for directly related purposes (unless otherwise required or authorised by or under law); as consented to by you or if a permitted general situation exists.
Tax File Numbers
The following information is provided to comply with the department’s obligation under Rule 14(1) of the Privacy (Tax File Number) Rule 2015 ( TFN Rule ).
Purpose of collection
A tax file number ( TFN ) is a unique identifier issued by the Commissioner of Taxation.  The department may collect TFNs for the following purposes:
to administer the Higher Education Loan Programs and Trade Support Loans
to make payments of salaries and wages to eligible employee types and contractors.
to administer child care financial assistance payments.
You are not legally obliged to quote your TFN but there may be financial consequences where you chose not to quote it.
Prohibitions and penalties
Certain Commonwealth legislation prohibits the collection, recording, use and disclosure of TFN information.  Relevantly:
the TFN Rule and the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) ( TAA ) contain prohibitions on:
requiring, requesting or collecting TFN information for unauthorised purposes (TFN Rule 8(1) and subsection 8WA(1) of the TAA).
recording, using or disclosing TFN information unless permitted under taxation, personal assistance or superannuation law (TFN Rules 9 and 10; and subsection 8WB(1) of the TAA).
A breach of the TFN Rule is an interference with privacy under the Privacy Act. Individuals who consider that their TFN information has been mishandled may make a complaint to the Australian Information Commissioner. Where the breach of privacy is very serious, the Australian Information Commissioner may seek a civil penalty.
A breach of either sections 8WA and 8WB of the TAA is punishable by a fine of 100 penalty units or 2 years imprisonment or both. NOTE: As at 31 July 2017, 1 penalty unit is equal to $210.
The A New Tax System (Family Assistance)(Administration) Act 1999 ( the Family Assistance Administration Act ) and Child Care Act 1972 ( the Child Care Act ) are both personal assistance laws within the definition contained in TFN Rule 6(2). These Acts contain prohibitions on the making of a record, disclosure, use, solicitation or supply of information that is protected information – which includes TFNs (sections 163 – 167 of the Families Assistance Administration Act and sections 12K, 12L, 12M, 12Q, 12R and 12S of the Child Care Act). These offences are punishable by two years imprisonment. There are exceptions permitting the collection, use or disclosure of protected information in limited circumstances, as outlined under Part 6 of the Family Assistance Administration Act, and Part IIIA of the Child Care Act.
The Higher Education Support Act 2003 ( HESA ) is a taxation law within the definition contained in TFN Rule 6(2). In collecting, recording, using and disclosing tax file numbers under HESA the department, the Australian Taxation Office, higher education providers and VET providers must not contravene sections 8WA and 8WB of the TAA.

Privacy Notices
In addition to our privacy policy , we may need to explain specific privacy practices in more detail at other times. In such circumstances we develop and provide separate privacy notices to describe how we will handle the personal information that we collect. For example, where we ask you to provide personal information in relation to a particular program that we administer, we will provide you with a privacy notice at the time of collection or as soon as practicable afterwards, which details our personal information handling practices in relation to that particular program.
Personal Information Holdings
We maintain, on an ongoing basis, a Personal Information Holdings document that explains the various types of personal information we collect and hold, what the information is used for and the third parties to whom the information is normally disclosed. Where applicable, the document also details where we are authorised to collect, use or disclose information under legislation relevant to our policies, programs and services.  A copy of the Personal Information Holdings document can be obtained from the Privacy Contact Officer whose details are below.
Electronic Communication
There are inherent risks associated with the transmission of information over the internet, including via email. You should be aware of this when sending personal information to us via email or via our website or social media platforms. If this is of concern to you then you may use other methods of communication with us, such as post, fax or telephone (although these also have risks associated with them).
We only record your email address when you send a message to us or subscribe to one of our mailing lists. Any personal information, including email addresses, will only be used or disclosed for the purpose for which it was provided.
