Additionally, members of the general public who attend our seminars and workshops, or meet with ICC representatives at college fairs or other events, may choose to provide their e-mail addresses in order to be included in our mailing list. We use this contact information to disseminate helpful admissions information in the form of a weekly blog, as well as e-mail updates about our company and services.
For individuals who use our site’s “Chat” feature, location and IP Address are displayed on the chat dashboard while the chat agent is online. However, that information is not stored anywhere after the user leaves the site or quits the chat.
Finally, traffic and data tracking services including Google Analytics and Search Console collect anonymized data from visitors including search query, website referral source, time on site, pages per visit, geographic location, and demographic data if available.
