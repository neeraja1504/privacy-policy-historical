Introduction
Into Film needs to collect personal data from its users to provide a full range of products and services. This Privacy Statement explains what personal information we collect and how it is processed.
Into Film collects personal data for the following three reasons:
To provide a personalised service to users of Into Film products and services
To help us monitor and make improvements to our services
To promote products and services to users if they have given us consent to do so
Our principles
Into Film is committed to protecting personal data and adheres strictly to the principles outlined in the Data Protection Act 1998 and The General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
We will ensure that the appropriate security measures are deployed to protect the information that you share with us
We will collect only the personal data required to provide the products and services that you opt into. No other data will be collected
We will provide sufficient information for users to make an informed choice about consenting to Into Film communications
We will only send communications that you have positively opted into receive, unless legitimate interest is deemed the lawful basis for sending communications - for example, Into Film Clubs
We will ensure your right to change your preferences at any time via your profile settings on the Into Film website or by contacting support@intofilm.org
We will ensure that all users can opt out of communications at any time
We will collect consent from a parent or legal guardian to collect the personal data of children and young people under the age of 16.
The information we collect and why
Registering for an Into Film account
We ask for the following information when users register for an Into Film account. An account is required to access a range of Into Film products and services including educational resources, Into Film Festival bookings and starting an Into Film Club.
Date of birth this enables us to set up and manage the right account for the user either an educator account or an account for a young person
First name, last name, email address and username
As part of the registration process we give users the option of being kept up-to-date with Into Film products and services via email. Users must proactively tick this box to give consent for Into Film to communicate with them. Registered users who do not tick this box will not receive emails from Into Film, unless it's related to an event that they have booked.
All Into Film emails include a clear link to unsubscribe from future communications. This can also be done by changing preferences in the profile page on the Into Film website or contacting support@intofilm.org
Into Film Festival
We will ask for a mobile telephone number when users register to attend a screening at the Into Film Festival. This is required as the cinema may need to call the ticket booker regarding a last-minute timing change, cancellation or late arrival.
Mobile phone numbers will not be used for any other purpose than contacting Into Festival attendees as described above, and mobile phone data will be deleted within one month of the Into Film Festival ending.
Data provided by Children and Young People
Children and young people aged 8 to 19, who are members of their school or college film club, can register to use the Into Film website. This allows them to write and publish film reviews online and recommend films to be shown at their club.
All children aged 16 or under are required to gain parental or legal guardian consent to access the Into Film site. This consent is gained when a child or young person provides a signed consent form to attend their film club.
Competitions and surveys
On occasion, Into Film will conduct competitions and surveys via an authorised data capture provider. The provider will be named at the point at which the survey or competition is launched. All third-party data capture providers will be vetted to ensure they are GDPR compliant. Any information collected via such a service will be shared only with Into Film and used only for the purposes of the competition or survey.
Some of our Into Film Festival communications are managed by a third-party agency. The agency is contracted to ensure GDPR compliance and that all data held by them is securely deleted within one month of the Into Film Festival ending.
How do we profile the data we hold?
We sometimes profile the personal data that we collect (see list below), as this enables Into Film to offer registered users a range of Into Film products and services that reflect their interests. We do not profile sensitive data, nor does our profiling of data have a legal or significant effect on the individual. We do not sell on data to any third parties.
