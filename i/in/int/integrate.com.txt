Your rights to access, to limit use, and to limit disclosure: European Union and Swiss individuals have the right to access personal information about them, and to limit use and disclosure of their personal information. If you wish to request access, to limit use, or to limit disclosure, please email Integrate privacy team at privacy@integrate.com or send a written request to the contact information provided below.
Disclosure of Personal Information
a. Integrate will not rent or sell your personal information to others but may disclose personal information with third-party vendors and service providers that work with Integrate. We will only share personal information to these vendors and service providers to help us provide a product or service to you. Examples of third parties we work with are call center operators, shippers, servicers, information processors, financial institutions, data appending and surge scoring companies. These third parties only have access to personal information necessary for them to complete their service.
b. Integrate provides both personal and non-personal information to subsidiaries, affiliated companies, and other businesses or persons for the purpose of processing such information on behalf of Integrate. Integrate may use third parties such as a credit card processing company to bill Users for transactions, and a credit scoring company to determine business credit scores (when applicable, for extending credit terms to Users upon request). At all times, these parties are required to agree to process such information in compliance with this Privacy Policy, and we deploy reasonable efforts to limit their use of such information.
c. Integrate reserves the right to disclose personal and non-personal information that is believed, in good faith, to be appropriate or necessary for the purpose of providing Services. Other causes of release of data may be due to, but not limited to: (i) taking precautions against liability issues; (ii) to assist government enforcement agencies; (iii) to investigate and defend Integrate against third party claims or allegations; (iv) to protect the security or integrity of the Website and/or Services; and/or (v) to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Integrate or others.
d. Integrate does not share personal information with other non-affiliated third-party companies for their commercial use or marketing use without your consent, except as part of Services.
e. Integrate shares non-personal information, such as anonymous user data and traffic data, with interested third parties to assist them in understanding the usage patterns and trends analysis for certain content, advertisements, promotions, services, and/or functionality of our Websites.
f. Integrate may release any information available if required to do so by law, or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with law or the powers of government enforcement agencies. Other causes for release of information could be for needs to comply with copyright laws or to respond to a court order, subpoena, and/or search warrant.  We also may be required to disclose an individual’s personal information in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
g. Integrate’s accountability for personal information it receives pursuant to the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield (“Privacy Shield Principles”) and subsequent transfer of that data to third parties is detailed in the Privacy Shield Principles.  Integrate may be liable pursuant to the Privacy Shield Principles if said third party agents claim that Integrate processes personal information in a manner inconsistent with pursuant to the Privacy Shield principles, unless Integrate can demonstrate that it is not responsible for the act or omission giving rise to the damage.  In cases of onward transfer to third parties of data of EU and Swiss individuals received, pursuant to the Privacy Shield Principles, Integrate is potentially liable.
EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework
Integrate complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States, respectively.  Integrate has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles.  If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.  To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/.

Data Security
Integrate utilizes commercially reasonable physical, technical, and managerial safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of personal information and to protect it against unauthorized access or use, alteration, unlawful or accidental destruction and accidental loss. However, Integrate cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Integrate or place upon the Website and you do so at your own risk. This is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, altered, disclosed, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. Personal information may be transferred outside Integrate to data processors, but they will only act on our instructions to provide the necessary services.
California Privacy Rights
California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits individual California residents to request certain information regarding Integrate's disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please write to privacy@integrate.com.  Please include your name, mailing address, and email address if you want to receive a response by email.

Integrate reserves the right to request that you provide information that will enable us to confirm that the User Content that you want removed was created and posted by you.
Integrate will make a good faith effort to delete or remove your User Content from public view as soon as reasonably practicable. Please note, however, that your request that we delete your User Content does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of your User Content. Your User Content may remain on backup media, cached or otherwise retained by Integrate for administrative or legal purposes or your User Content may remain publicly available if you or someone else has forwarded or re-posted your User Content on another website or service prior to its deletion. Integrate may also be required by law to not remove (or allow removal) of your User Content.
Children's Privacy

For that reason, Integrate does not knowingly collect or maintain any information via the Website from persons under the age of thirteen (13), and no part of our Website is directed to persons under the age of thirteen (13). If an underage person provides such information and Integrate has unknowingly collected said information, then Integrate will take the appropriate steps to delete this information immediately.
