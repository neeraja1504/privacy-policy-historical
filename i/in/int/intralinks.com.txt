Cookies
We also collect information about website users through “cookies.” Cookies are small pieces of information sent by a web server to a web browser which allow the server to uniquely identify the browser on each page. For further information about Cookies, please see our "Cookies" section below.
What information does Intralinks collect about users of its Service and how is this information used?
This section applies to users of the Intralinks Service. If you only use our public website, this section does not apply to you. If you, your employer or a third party decide to purchase our Service, we will use your Personal Information for purposes of providing the Service to you. We will also provide your Personal Information to trusted partners and our affiliates who work on behalf of Intralinks and use your Personal Information to help Intralinks provide the Service. Such partners include database providers (such as Oracle), data analytics providers (such as Amazon Web Services) and other suppliers who assist with providing technical support (such as RightNow (Oracle) and IntegrityNet). We use this information because we have a legitimate business interest in performing the contract that we have entered into with you, your employer or a third party and in providing, managing and administering our Service.
Setting Up the Service
In this Privacy Policy, an “Exchange” or a “Workspace” mean a portion of the Service configured to permit authorized users to access and share information. The manager of an Exchange, the owner of a Workspace, your employer or an affiliate or partner of your employer, who is using the Service, may add you as a participant in one or more Exchanges or Workspaces. The person adding you for the first time to an Exchange or Workspace will provide certain Personal Information about you, such as your name, company name, work email address and work telephone number. We will provide you with a user ID (an email address) and account activation email to access the Service and create a user “profile” for use as described below.
When you first sign onto the Service, you will be presented with your “profile,” which contains the information supplied to us. You will be able to update or correct any of the Personal Information in your profile. As the Service is intended for business purposes only, unless your place of work is also your home, you should only enter business contact information. We use this information to provide the Service and to identify how you'd like to use your account. We use this information because it is necessary to provide you with an account and because we have a legitimate business interest in enabling you to update your preferences and settings online.
Once your Personal Information has been entered into your profile, this information is added to the participant list for each Exchange or Workspace you have been authorized to access. Other participants of your Exchange(s) or Workspace(s) may then have access to your Personal Information. You may receive certain emails relating to your use of the Service, such as email alerts related to Exchanges or Workspaces on which you are a participant and other email communications relating to the Service. Emails will be sent to the email address(es) listed in your profile.
Your Personal Information is also added to Intralinks' global directory of current and former users of the Service (the “GUD”). If you are selected to join another Exchange or Workspace in the future, your user ID will be authorized to access that Exchange, and your Personal Information will be added to the participant list for that Exchange or Workspace. Our clients also have the ability to maintain one or more “business groups,” which are contact lists comprised of all users that have used the Exchanges or Workspaces that they have managed. Your Personal Information may be added to one or more of these business groups.
We use your Personal Information as set forth above to provide, manage and facilitate your use of the Service, whether now or in the future. We use this information because we have a legitimate business interest in performing the contract that we have entered into with your employer, or with the affiliate or partner of your employer (as applicable). We will keep this information for as long as you remain an Intralinks account holder
Reports and Analytics
As a function of the Service and in order to conduct internal analysis of use of the Service, Intralinks also will maintain a history of your access to the Service, and certain actions taken by you while accessing the Service (e.g. access to Exchanges, Workspaces and documents, including time, date and length of access). This includes maintaining a log of users' IP addresses, the websites from which users access the Service, the type of web browsers used to access the Service and the browser's settings that may affect Service performance. The information described in this paragraph is referred to as “ Usage Log Information.” It may also be combined with Usage Log Information about other users of an Exchange or Workspace you are permissioned into to provide an overall view of how the Exchange or Workspace is used.
Usage Log Information will be recorded and used internally within Intralinks and may also be made available to managers of Exchanges, owners of Workspaces, Service licensees or to your employer or entity on whose behalf you are accessing the Service.
We use this information because we have a legitimate business interest in understanding how our Service is accessed, how it is used and whether there are any potential security issues arising from such use.  We will keep this information for a reasonable length of time that allows us to provide the Service, to perform the contract that we have entered into with your employer, or with the affiliate or partner of your employer (as applicable) and to understand how people use our Service.
Support
We share Usage Log Information, as well as information about your browser and other local computer settings, with Exchange managers and Workspace owners in order to troubleshoot or avoid potential access problems. We also use this information (in addition to your contact information) to contact you in relation to providing you with support, including where you have already contacted us via telephone, email or our "Chat with Us" function. Where necessary, we disclose this information to trusted support providers (such as RightNow (Oracle)) who will undertake this role on our behalf.
We need this information to provide you with support requested. We use and disclose this information to provide the Service and provide relevant support services. We use this information because we have a legitimate business interest in ensuring that you receive an effective Service from us. We will keep this information for a reasonable length of time that lets us understand any technical issues that users have with our Service.
Exchange Managers and Workspace Owners
If you have been designated by your organisation as an Exchange manager or Workspace owner, we will use your Personal Information when we are undertaking work on behalf of your organisation, for example adding participants for the first time to an Exchange or Workspace. We use your Personal Information because it is necessary for our contract with your organisation that we interact with you in order to comply with your organisation's instructions. We will keep this information for as long as your organisation has a relationship with us.
Marketing
If you are a user of the Service and we have a permission to send you marketing messages, we will use your Personal Information to contact you about our services and products. We will contact you either by email or phone. We also use Usage Log Information to better tailor these communications to you by identifying those features and aspects of our services that are most relevant to you based on your historic usage.
You may decline to receive mail or email from us by selecting the opt-out link which will be contained in any such email that you receive, or by contacting us using the details at How can I change, update or delete my contact information or request that I not be contacted for non-support purposes?
Sale or Merger of Intralinks
Subject to applicable law, as the GUD is a business asset of Intralinks, if Intralinks were sold to or merged with another company, the GUD (which includes your Personal Information) may be transferred to a successor of the company, or to a subsidiary or affiliate of Intralinks, who will agree to abide by the terms of this Privacy Policy. You have the right to request that your Personal Information be removed from the GUD at any time (see below).
Legal Requirements
We will also disclose personal information (1) in response to lawful requests by public authorities (including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements) and, where applicable, in accordance with our internal policy on access by government or regulatory authorities and (2) in our sole discretion if we believe that such disclosure is appropriate in connection with an official government or regulatory investigation or in response to a perceived significant threat to a person's health or property.
Intralinks may also process your Personal Information if necessary in the defence of a legal claim. We will not delete Personal Information if relevant to an investigation or a dispute. It will continue to be stored until those issues are fully resolved.
What information could Intralinks otherwise collect about me?
Billing
If you have been designated by your organisation as being a contact for billing or payment purposes, we will use your Personal Information to process your organisation's order, issue invoices to your organisation and take payment from, or make payment to, you (including refunds if applicable). We use this information because it is necessary for our contract with your organisation that we collect information from its representatives to process payments or give or receive refunds. We will keep information relating to payments for the length of the contract between us and for ten (10) years afterwards.
Reviews and Feedback
If you are a user of an Exchange or Workspace and you contact Intralinks to provide feedback or reviews of your experience, we will use your Personal Information (as well as your feedback/review) to understand and respond to customer feedback. We use this information because we have a legitimate business interest in understanding customer feedback and in responding to your communications in a consistent way. We will keep this information for a reasonable length of time that lets us understand and assess people’s experience of our Service.
How does Intralinks protect the security of my Personal Information?
Intralinks has implemented and currently maintains an effective written information security program that includes administrative, technical, and physical safeguards and other security measures necessary to (a) ensure the security, confidentiality, and integrity of your Personal Information; (b) protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security, confidentiality, and integrity of your Personal Information; (c) protect against unauthorized access to, destruction, modification, disclosure or use of your Personal Information; and (d) detect and respond to security incidents involving your Personal Information. We permit persons working for us to access and use your Personal Information only to serve our legitimate business and our customers’ service needs, in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Privacy Policy, Intralinks will disclose your Personal Information (1) in response to a subpoena, search warrant, court order, exchange rule, other legal process or where Intralinks is otherwise required to do so in accordance with locally applicable law and where applicable, our internal policy on access by government or regulatory authorities; and (2) in its sole discretion if it believes such disclosure is appropriate in connection with an official government or regulatory investigation, or under exigent circumstances in response to a perceived significant threat to a person's health or property.
What about transfer of my Personal Information to other countries?
Your Personal Information may be stored and processed in any country where we have facilities or in which we engage service providers, including to countries outside of the location(s) of your business, such as the United States and countries within Europe, Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region. Where such transfers of your Personal Information are made they will be made in accordance with applicable law.
Transfer of Information to Other Countries – Users in European Economic Area (EEA)
We store your Personal Information on cloud servers located in the United States. In addition, we use suppliers in the United States that support the provision of our Service. The transfer of this information is governed by a contract including standard contractual clauses (SCCs) approved by the European Commission.
Where our U.S. affiliates process information about EEA users, the transfer of this information is governed by the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. Please see "Does Intralinks participate in the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework?" for more information.
Our Customer Support team may, depending on the time that support is requested by a user, be provided by personnel located in our affiliates' offices outside the EEA or by third-party contractors located in the Philippines (IntegrityNet) and India (Integreon). The transfer to our affiliates and third-party subcontractors is governed by SCCs approved by the European Commission.
We are happy to provide you with copies of the SCCs, which you can request at privacy@intralinks.com.

**Intralinks' commitment to the Privacy Shield Principles  **
Intralinks, Inc. complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield (the Privacy Shield) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union and the United Kingdom to the United States in reliance on Privacy Shield.

The commitments contained in this notice only apply to personal data received by Intralinks from the EEA. Individuals whose personal data is received by Intralinks from other jurisdictions do not have the rights set out in this notice.
**Types of personal data collected and purposes for collection and use  **
Intralinks processes certain personal data it receives from the EEA for two purposes: (1) firstly it processes certain personal data on its own behalf for its internal business purposes; and (2) it also processes certain personal data it receives from the EEA on behalf of its customers. In processing each of these categories of personal data, it acts as a data controller (in relation to the first purpose) and a data processor (in relation to the second purpose) respectively. This Privacy Shield Notice explains how Intralinks processes personal data in each of these circumstances.
_Intralinks as a data controller  _
Details on the types of personal data that we receive from the EEA as a data controller, and the purposes for which we collect and use such data, are set out in our Privacy Policy. This policy is presented to each of our end users as part of the end user registration process for our products and services.
Intralinks as a data processor
The nature of Intralinks’ permission-based online services (that is, the Intralinks® platform, Intralinks® Exchanges or Intralinks® Workspaces (together, the Services )) provided to Intralinks' customers means that we will process information that end users have uploaded, stored or shared using the Services, the content of which is not known to Intralinks. While much of this information will be financial, corporate or institutional in nature, it will at times include personal data which Intralinks processes following its customers' instructions.
As a data processor, Intralinks will also process personal data relating to those end users who have been permitted by Intralinks' customers to access Intralinks Services. Such data will be used to provide and operate the Services, and to provide analytics and reporting information to Intralinks' customers.
Intralinks does not control or own such data and handles such data as a data processor only. It processes such data as governed by the written agreements in place with its customers and to the extent necessary to comply with applicable law.
**Types of third parties to whom we disclose personal data and the purposes for such disclosure  **
Intralinks as a data controller
As a data controller, Intralinks may further disclose personal data which has been transferred from the EEA to the third parties who are set out in our Privacy & Cookies Policy.
_Intralinks as a data processor  _
As a data processor, Intralinks may further disclose personal data which has been received from the EEA as instructed by the data controller. We may also disclose personal data to our third-party service providers who work on behalf of or with Intralinks under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use personal data to help Intralinks provide the Services for our customers.
If Intralinks were sold to or merged with another company, personal data processed as part of the Services may be transferred to a prospective successor or successor of the company, or to a subsidiary or affiliate of Intralinks.
Disclosures in response to lawful requests by public authorities
Intralinks may also disclose personal data (1) in response to lawful requests by public authorities (including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements) and, where applicable, in accordance with our internal policy on access by government or regulatory authorities and (2) in our sole discretion if we believe that such disclosure is appropriate in connection with an official government or regulatory investigation or in response to a perceived significant threat to a person's health or property.
Choice
If you do not wish Intralinks to pass your personal data that is processed as a Data Controller to a third party who subsequently uses your data for its own purposes (such as one of our marketing partners), you can contact us via the details set out in Contact us below.
**Intralinks' liability for third parties  **
If a third party providing services on Intralinks' behalf processes personal data from the EEA in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, Intralinks will be liable, unless we can prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
**Data integrity and purpose limitation  **
When Intralinks is acting as a data processor, Intralinks will process personal data in compliance with the instructions of its customers, who act as data controllers in respect of such data and will be responsible for ensuring that the personal data is appropriate and only processed for limited purposes. In addition, when its provision of services to a customer ceases, Intralinks will, as agreed with the customer, comply with Intralinks' policy for the secure deletion of personal data processed on behalf of that customer.
Access
You have certain rights under the Principles to access personal data about you that Intralinks processes as a data controller. To access such personal information contact us by email at privacy@intralinks.com. We will respond to your request in accordance with the Principles.
Where Intralinks is acting as a data processor, we will pass each request that we receive from an individual to access, correct, amend or delete personal data relating to them ( Request ) to the relevant data controller and will not respond to the Request itself. Intralinks, to the extent instructed by a data controller and in accordance with its customer agreements and applicable law, will assist a customer in complying with Requests by providing relevant information and support to the relevant customer to enable it to comply with the Request.
**FTC's investigatory and enforcement powers  **
Intralinks' commitments under the Privacy Shield, and compliance with the Principles, are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.
Complaints
If you have any complaint regarding Intralinks' compliance with the Principles please contact us by email at privacy@intralinks.com. We will respond to your complaint within 45 calendar days of receipt of your email.
Where your complaint relates to personal data that we process on behalf of our one of our customers, we may pass your complaint to the relevant customer and will tell you we have done so.
**Independent dispute resolution body  **
If you feel that Intralinks has not satisfactorily resolved your complaint or has failed to respond to your complaint within 45 days, you may bring your complaint to the attention of your local data protection authority within the EEA ( DPA ). The DPAs will establish a panel to act as an independent dispute resolution body who will investigate and resolve complaints brought under the Privacy Shield free of charge to you. Intralinks commits to cooperate with this panel as an independent body to resolve disputes relating to its compliance with the Principles. Intralinks will comply with any advice given by DPAs where they take the view that specific action is necessary to comply with the Principles and will provide the DPAs with written confirmation that such action has been taken.
You can find the details of your local DPA here.
Arbitration
If you are located in the EEA and have not been able to resolve your complaint by any other mechanism, you may, in certain circumstances, be able to seek resolution via binding arbitration. For additional information about the arbitration process, please visit the Privacy Shield website.
You can find the details of your local DPA here: http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm.
