B. Strategic and Media/Club Partners
From time to time we may enter into a special relationship with another company that is not owned by or affiliated with the Company to provide additional features on the Site. These special relationships may include Partners, sponsors, and co-branded sites (referred to here as “co-branded pages”). Any information, including Personal Information that you provide on one of these co-branded pages, may be shared with such Partners or sponsors. By participating in activities or providing your Personal Information on these co-branded pages (or by accessing these co-branded pages or the Site), you consent to our providing your Personal Information to such Partners or sponsors. As such Partners or sponsors will use your Personal Information in accordance with their own privacy practices, you should review their privacy policies. Our Partners include both strategic partners and the clubs that participate in Company events and we may share your Personal Information with such strategic and club partners so that they may communicate with you directly about their products and services.
C. Service Providers
We may use third party service providers to help us operate our business and the Site or administer activities on our behalf, such as sending emails, fulfilling orders, and administering sweepstakes. We may share your Personal Information with such service providers for such limited purposes. For instance, if you participate in a sweepstakes, game, or loyalty program that results in a prize or award, we will share your Personal Information with our fulfillment and management agencies.
D. Advertising Networks
We may have relationships with third party service providers known as advertising networks to place and administer advertisements on our behalf across the Internet. Using cookies and pixel tags (also known as web beacons), advertising networks may collect anonymous information about your visits to the Site and other websites in order to deliver advertisements that may be of particular interest to you. This process does not involve the collection of any Personal Information. The advertising networks do not know your name, phone number, address, email address or any Personal Information. Nor do we share any Personal Information with such advertising networks. To find out more about how such advertising networks manage the privacy of Personal Information in conjunction with delivering advertisements online and how to opt-out of information collection by such advertising networks please go to: http://www.youradchoices.com or http://www.networkadvertising.org. The cookie consent pop up that you see when you log on to our Site for the first time allows you to opt out of the use of third party cookies.

In addition to the third parties described above, Personal Information of any Visitor, or individual whose information is collected otherwise, may also be shared with parties outside of the Company: (i) as permitted by law, (ii) in the event of a transfer of ownership, assets or a bankruptcy of the Company, (iii) if we determine that disclosure of specific information is necessary to comply with the request of a law enforcement or regulatory agency or other legal process, or (iv) to protect the interests or safety of the Company or Visitors to the Site.
Your Choices with Respect to Personal Information
The Site gives Visitors who register on the Site the opportunity to stop receiving communications from the Company if requested. The Site also gives registered Visitors options for changing and modifying Personal Information previously provided. To remove or change Personal Information in our database, or to not receive future communications from the Company, please contact us at privacy@releventsports.com.
Children
The Company does not knowingly solicit or collect Personal Information from Visitors or individuals under the age of eighteen (18) (“Minors”), and we will not knowingly link to any third party website that solicits or collects Personal Information from Minors.

Security and Protection of Personal Information Collected by Us
The Site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the Personal Information under our control. The Company has implemented various physical, electronic, and managerial measures, including education and training of our personnel, to provide Personal Information with reasonable protection from accidental loss or destruction, improper use, alteration, or disclosure. The Company has invested and deployed a wide variety of technology and security features to ensure the privacy of Personal Information that is collected by the Company. The Company will continue to revise policies and implement additional security features as new technologies become available.
International Transfers of Personal Information
Permitted transfers of information, including Personal Information, either to third parties or within the Company, include the transfer of information from one jurisdiction to another, such as transfers to and from the United States. Because privacy laws vary from one jurisdiction to another, Personal Information may be transferred to a jurisdiction where the laws provide less or different protection than the jurisdiction in which the Personal Information originated. We will always handle your Personal Information as described in this Policy. To facilitate the secure transfer of your Personal Information from the EEA to the United States, we execute approved “standard contractual clauses” approved by the European Commission with entities that provide Personal Information to us.
Access to, Correction of, and Deletion of Your Personal Information
You have the right to the following with respect to your Personal Information:  obtain a copy, ask for a correction if it is inaccurate, request restriction of processing, and request deletion. If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please contact us at privacy@releventsports.com. Please note, however, that before the Company is able to respond to any of these requests, we may ask you to verify your identity and to provide other details, including Personal Information, to help us to respond to your request. The Company affirms that it will correct, amend, or delete any erroneous information if instructed to do so by you and if required by law.  We will not charge a fee for responding to any such request unless the request is repetitive or unduly burdensome.
Enforcement
The Company will cooperate with the appropriate data protection authorities to resolve any complaints and disputes arising in connection with this Policy. All necessary Company employees will be required to be familiar with and adhere to this Policy. The Company will investigate any reported complaints of violations of this Policy and will take prompt remedial action where violations are found.

You should check the Site periodically to review the most recent Policy. Your use of the Site or provision of Personal Information to the Company or any of our Partners after any update, modification, or change to this Policy constitutes your acceptance of and agreement to such updates, modifications, or changes.

We process the Personal Information of individuals who are located in the EEA (“EEA Data Subjects”) for one or more of several lawful purposes, including:
With your explicit consent:
To provide you with Company services, including customer service support;
