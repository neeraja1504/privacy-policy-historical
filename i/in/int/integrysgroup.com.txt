Personal Information
You may be asked to submit personal information such as your name, address, phone number and email address. We will protect all information that you provide us on the website, as set forth below:
The personal information you provide us not only enables you to access various services offered on the website, but also enables us to provide you with better service. We may use this information to contact you to respond to an inquiry that you send to TEG. If you choose to communicate with TEG by email, then email from TEG to you will be considered to be sent with your consent and will be accessible to anyone who has access to your email.
In order to provide you with services offered on the website, or to complete transactions or requests initiated by you on the website, we may transfer you to a website operated by third parties that help us provide services to you. In such cases, we will have agreements with those parties under which they will agree to maintain the confidentiality of your personal information and to use it only for the purpose of helping us serve you. We only transfer or share information to those who have a privacy policy at least as stringent or substantially similar to TEG.
Other than as set forth herein, we will not disclose your personal information to third parties without your written consent (which consent may be obtained electronically, such as by email), unless we reasonably believe that the disclosure is essential to the conduct of TEG's business, including but not limited to where such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with the law, legal process or our regulators, (b) collect unpaid bills, (c) enable TEG's employees or consultants to provide service to you and to otherwise perform their duties, (d) comply with interchange functions, (e) obtain and provide credit reporting information, or (f) resolve customer disputes or inquiries. We do not provide your personal information to third parties for the purpose of telemarketing, email or direct-mail solicitation.
You should protect the confidentiality of your username and password. You are responsible for all activity on the website accessed by your username and password. Access by TEG's employees or consultants to any personal information you provide is limited to only that necessary to provide the business service offered and to otherwise allow such employees or consultants to perform their duties.

Our Use of Your IP Address
An Internet Protocol ("IP") address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer every time that you browse the Internet. When you visit the website, our servers log your current IP address. We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers and to administer our website. Data gathered from logging your IP address is not tied to your personal information and is not used to identify you.

Our Use of Cookies
Cookies are small text files placed on your computer's hard drive by Web page servers. When you visit the website, our server may create "session" cookies, making it more convenient for you to use our site by verifying when you travel from page to page that you have signed up with our online services.
The website may use cookies and other technologies such as pixel tags and web beacons. These technologies help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our website people have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches.
TEG and our partners also use cookies and other technologies to remember personal information when you use our website and applications. Our goal in these cases is to make your experience with TEG more convenient and personal.
As is true of most websites, we gather some information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language, Internet service provider (ISP), referring and exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer the site, to learn about user behavior on the site, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
In some of our email messages, we use a "click-through URL" linked to content on the TEG website. When customers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the destination page on our website. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic links in the email messages.
