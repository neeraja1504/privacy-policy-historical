Used alone or in cooperation with your ISP, your IP address can be used reveal what geographic area you are connecting from, or which ISP you are using. Your IP address may be used to address problems with our server, administer our Site and/or to gather broad demographic information about our Members. Finally, the other websites that you visit have IP addresses, and we may collect the IP addresses of those websites and their pages, as well. If you choose to make any purchases through our Site, you will be required to provide payment information including information for your method of payment, your name and address information (the "Financial Information").

Passive Information is used to help better tailor your experience on the Site with reading suggestions and advertisements based upon your past use of the Site. Passive Information is also used in the aggregate to maintain and improve the Site based upon all members usage of the Site. Passive information may be collected through the use of "cookies". If you do not wish to store "cookie" information on your computer, you may turn off this in your web browser; however, please be aware that doing so will not disable the Passive Information collected by the Site.
