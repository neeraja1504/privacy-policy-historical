What Information Is Collected And How Is It Used?
Information is collected from users in the following areas of this site:
Registration
Information is collected from members when they register for Simpleology, which can happen either through our homepage or when customers purchase any product with us. In order to create a membership account with us, members are required to provide their first and last name, their email address, and may also be asked their country, postal code and phone number. This information is used to:
verify the legitimacy of the registration (for more information, see "Communications From This Site"); and
identify the member when they log into Simpleology, and to customize their experience based on what courses they have purchased; and
contact the member should an issue arise with their product order or their Simpleology account;
if approval is given by the member, to inform them of new and/or related product offerings in which they may be interested (see "Sharing"); and
geographical information, when collected, is done so for our own research purposes and is not connected to member's Personally Identifiable Information following its collection.
Upon registration, members also have the option to subscribe to receive newsletters and communications from www.simpleology.com.
www.simpleology.com runs two mailing lists:
Simpleology Weekly - our main list to inform members of important events and service announcements; and
Simpleology Daily - a daily service of reminders and motivational information.
Inside Simpleology
After logging into Simpleology, members may submit personal, and personally identifiable, information using the tools and software available inside Simpleology. The information submitted via the Simplify My Life, Mental Lockbox, Delegation Station, Dream Catcher, Observation Log, and Major Focus sections is voluntary.  Company employees are bound by non-disclosure agreement and code of conduct in which they may only access member accounts in order to troubleshoot specific support requests. The information may be used by the company's marketing team to further customize the member's experience of the site, and to better target our information, tools and offerings. Such information may, on occasion, be passed in aggregate form (non-personally identifiable) to third parties (see "Sharing" for more information).Construct Zero, Inc
Support Desk
Information such as name and email address is required when members submit a ticket to our support desk.  This information is required so that the customer care team may respond to that query, and the member may track the progress of their complaint online. The information collected is used solely for purpose of resolving the member's complaint or query.
Refer-a-Friend
When new members register for Simpleology, we may present them with the option of selecting to tell friends about Simpleology also. If the new member elects to use our Refer-a-Friend service for passing on information about our web site to another person, we ask the referrer for their friend’s first name and email address for the purpose of sending the friend a one-time email containing a link to our website. The communication sent will include an explanation of how the friend came to receive the email and a link to our support desk if they have any concerns. Construct Zero, Inc stores the information collected via this tool on a log file, but does not use it for any purpose other than to send this one-time email.
Testimonial Form
Construct Zero, Inc invites all members to post a testimonial about Simpleology using our Testimonial Form located here
http://www.simpleology.com/testimonials.htm
Personally identifiable information submitted by members via the testimonial form may include: name, website address, phone number and contact information, and any pictures of the member that the member wishes to add.
The information provided in this form is completely voluntary and at the discretion of the member. When submitting personally identifiable information via a testimonial, members should be aware that their information may be published by Construct Zero, Inc or used in our marketing, and that such information may be read, collected, or used by other Simpleology members or members of the public.

This information is used to assess the person's suitability for the Simpleology Partnership Program. If the person is successful, they will be required to supply information to set up their account, including their name, mailing address, phone number, paypal address, email address, and Tax ID. This information is used to deliver strategic partner related information and services, and pay commission payments.

Once the verification process is successfully completed, the new member receives a welcoming email which confirms their membership login details, and supplies a link to login to the website and to our support desk. If the member has also made a purchase, they will receive an email confirming their purchase and a link to where they can access the product.
For every requested communication sent to members, we include an explanation of how the member came to be on that the mailing list and present an unsubscribe option.

Log Files
Like most standard web site services, we use log files. The following information is automatically logged by our web site servers upon connection:
IP address
Time and date stamp
This information is logged beside your account profile in our system and stored for 14 days, after which it is then discarded from our system. It is therefore is linked to your personally identifiable information.
Cookies
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. It allows information entered in one webpage to be "remembered" when you enter a new webpage.
We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.
We use session cookies to remember login information entered inside Simpleology and our Support Suite as you click through our web pages. The session cookie will expire once you logout. If you voluntarily select for our system to “remember” you next time you login, we will set a persistent cookie on your machine in place of the usual session cookie, and this cookie will store your login information and recall it next time you login.
For Simpleology, the persistent cookie simply recalls your login information (i.e. your username and password) and is not linked to your personally identifiable information.
In the Support Suite, your email address is used to form the username part of your Support Suite login, therefore both the session and persistent cookies in this section are linked to that personally identifiable information.
Information about how to clear your forum cookies can be found here:
_http://www.simpleology.com/forums/faq.php?faq=vb_user_maintain#faq_vb_clear_cookies _ If you reject cookies, your ability to use our site will be limited. If your system does not allow cookies for example, you will find that every time you access a new webpage inside our Control Panel, you will be prompted to login again.
For more information about cookies, please see:

Some of our business partners (e.g. agents or service providers) use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies.
Surveys or Contests
From time-to-time www.simpleology.com may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys.  If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and therefore you have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.  The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name, email and/or shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code).
We use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes.
We may use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests; that company will be prohibited from using our users' personally identifiable information for any other purpose.
