General Resume Database Access Guidelines
Resume database access is limited to US organizations, companies or US DoD contractors.
Access is not knowingly given to any organization that works against the interests of the United States of America.
Access is limited to organizations and individuals registering for the purpose of recruiting potential future employees.
Potential employers should have a clear requirement for the skills within our database.
All requested identifying employer information must be provided before access will be considered.
Access will not be given to parties believed to be competitors, or partnered with competitors, in the area of cleared personnel recruiting.
Initial access may be delayed for as much as 72 hours while potential employer information is confirmed.
Denied access will be without explanation.
Media Access Guidelines
Resume database access is not routinely granted to the news media, or associated technical support divisions.
Requests for access must be accompanied by a letterhead explanation of the intended use of resume information, who will have access to the information, and what safeguard will be taken to ensure that this information will be used only for the purpose of seeking potential employees.
At no time will contact information be revealed. All resumes will be "anonymous" when searched.
Contact will occur only by the use of a resume reference number and the forwarding of contact instructions to the resume owner. IntelligenceCareers staff will contact the individual who may choose to reply or not to reply.
Collected Information Usage
Other than being provided to potential employers, collected resume information is not shared, sold or rented.
Email addresses within resumes are not used for any purpose other than to contact resume owners regarding the upkeep of their resume or to forward contact information from a potential employer.
Liability for Content and Access to Resumes
Users of our resume search service are national and international. We review all users before allowing access, and access is granted to organizations that have a valid interest in information technology, information sciences, and intelligence derived from information. Users may include government, academia, the defense industry, and information sciences industry members to include media. Access is not knowingly given to any organization that may have intentions other than offering employment, or that may be inappropriate viewers of your career info.
Intelligence Careers recognizes that some of the information contained in resumes for information intelligence professionals may be sensitive or contain potentially proprietary information. Intelligence Careers does not review and does not take responsibility for what is contained within resumes. Resume content is the liability of the resume writer.
Total Confidentiality of Your Resume Cannot Be Guaranteed
The confidentiality of material posted on any Internet cannot be guaranteed. It should be expected that your resume information can be potentially viewed by anyone with access to theÂ  Internet, and a determination to hack a system. To meet the concern for security and privacy there are a number of protective measures used to include allowing the assignment of anonymous identifiers to resumes listings.
The Choice to be Anonymous
"Anonymous" privacy for resume owners is offered. Choosing "Anonymous" when submitting or updating a resume may limit your opportunities. However, this option will also limit knowledge about your persona or participation in previous career activities.
If you have a strong resume then recruiters will contact you. Selecting "Anonymous" blocks ANY potential employer from viewing contact information data fields. This feature can be turned on or off whenever the user updates their resume.
Resumes can be editted online by resume owners via a login and password protected interface. Post-submission changes can be requested by contacting webmaster@intelligencecareers.com..
Miscalleneous
Intelligence Careers supports the Opt-In method for email information dissemination such as newsletters.
Requests for lost password updates will be sent only to the email address onfile or to onfile addresses.
Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption is used to protect all financial transactions.
