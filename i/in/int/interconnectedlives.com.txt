Your information, regardless of the country you reside in, will be collected and processed for several purposes as described in the policy. By providing your information, you, as the user, consent to the collection and processing of information by Interconnected Lives.
When the phrase ‘personal information’ is used, it only means information used to identify the user, i.e. your name, telephone number, address, email address and any other information that could be linked or associated with you. However, when the phrase ‘Anonymous information’ is used here, it means information that is not linked to you or your personal information. It does not enable us to identify or contact you.

We also collect information from users who visit the site anonymously, which is referred to as the ‘Anonymous information’ above; however, we will do so only if the users voluntarily submit their information. In case the user refuses to submit his/her personal information, we will not collect the data, but this will prevent the user from engaging in certain activities offered in the site.
Non-personal Information
Interconnected Lives may also collect non-personal information from users whenever an interaction with the site is detected. The information may also include your browser name, computer type and any other types of technical information that may be used as a means to connect with the site.

Interconnected Lives is only meant for adults above the age of 13. Interconnected Lives also contains content that might not be suitable for children. Therefore, our site and services is only meant for adults and not for children. At the Interconnected Lives, we take our policies very seriously and do not maintain or collect any sort of information, either personal or non-personal, from children.
Our site is not designed to attract children who are under 13 and once we are notified that a user is below 13 years of age, we will take necessary steps to restrict the user from using the features and other services offered in the site. In addition, we will also remove all the information about the user that is collected in our data base.
How does Interconnected Lives Collect Information?
As mentioned above, we collect both personal and anonymous information.
Personal Information
Generally, we collect personal information so that it helps us provide the best services and features to you. Additionally, it also helps us understand more about the site and the features. We only collect the information that is submitted voluntarily by you as you browse through the services and features. In addition, we also use personal information whenever any sort of communication occurs between the user and us.
For instance, if a user sends an email, then his/her personal information will be collected. It is important to note that you should only provide information you want other users to see about you. Having said that, you can choose not to offer your personal information but it will also limit you from using certain features of the site.
Interconnected Lives can be accessed by anybody across the world (users above the age of 18), but if you want to enjoy all the features offered in the site, it is recommended that you open an “Account”. In order to open an account, you can go through different steps, but it’s suggested that it’s easier to do so through social media sites such as Facebook.
Once you open your account through a third party site by using your separate id and password, you can easily access all the features of our site. Note that by doing so, you are granting us the permission to gain access to your personal information. Essentially, you are also agreeing to the terms and conditions on our site and the third party site too.
Once a user opens an account through another third party site, our site receives information from that site in order to make it easier and faster for you to create an account on our site. Again, we will only collect information you have made public, which means that you set your privacy settings in that manner.
The information collected by our site may very well depend on the kind of settings you have set on that particular third party site. However, if you don’t want other users to view your information, you can alter your privacy settings on that site.
You can also disable your Facebook or any other third party site login by logging into your account you have created on Interconnected Lives. In case you don’t want to follow the procedure outlined above, you can simply open your account by submitting information about your email address.

In this case, you will need to register and open an account, as already mentioned and our site might use another third party site to deliver the particular functionality.
In such cases, we will not be collecting your information since it will be the third party site that is collecting the data. In any case, please review all your personal information before you provide it and please ensure that you are careful while disclosing your information.
