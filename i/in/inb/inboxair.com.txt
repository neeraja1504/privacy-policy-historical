Privacy and permission policy
At InboxAir, protecting your privacy and the privacy of anyone receiving your email is very important. These policies are for the purpose of making InboxAir safe and appropriate for all.
Policy on permission
InboxAir is permission-based. That means you need permission to send to the people who receive your emails. InboxAir's permission policy is part of the Terms of Use agreed to by every InboxAir subscriber, and conforms to Can-Spam regulations.
To send an email to someone using InboxAir, that recipient must be either someone who is a customer, member or subscriber of your business or organization or who has specifically asked to receive your emails by opting in or signing up in some way, or someone who has bought a product or service from you in the past 18 months and have agreed to receive follow up emails related to those products or services.
Sender Responsibility
To send mailings using InboxAir, you must follow the guidelines set by the domains you are sending to regarding list management, promotion content, and sending practices.
In order to prevent your mailing from being blocked, throttled, or ending up in the spam folder at recipient email providers, you must take all necessary actions to keep your subscriber list sufficiently responsive, follow the email providers' accepted email coding practices (if you use your own custom email code), and make an effort to avoid sending promotions that are likely to be interpreted by the provider as 'spam.'
If your mailings do not follow these guidelines they may be considered in violation of the InboxAir privacy and permission policy.
Safety of your personal information
InboxAir collects certain information about you in order to allow your account to function properly. At any time, you may log in and change this information, or remove it. Under no circumstances will we share your personal information with any third party.
Protecting your customer lists and data
Although we reserve the right to monitor your lists, content and response data from time to time to make sure they comply with our Terms of Use, we will never share, sell or rent your customer data to anyone for any reason.
InboxAir will not sell, rent, loan or lease your email address or other personal information to anyone. Period.

Periodic emails from InboxAir
From time to time you may receive from us emails related to your account or your use of InboxAir. Every email will contain a link for you to be able to opt-out of receiving it.
We will not sell or rent your email address. Ever.
Ensuring secure billing transactions
You are asked to supply certain credit card and billing information in order to purchase InboxAir's services. That information is transferred, using the most secure transmission technology, to a trusted third party for processing. The information is then encrypted and securely stored to handle your transactions.
