InboxLabs - Outstanging Email Marketing
The Privacy Policy covers InboxLabs' (“the Company”) treatment of personally identifiable information that is collected when the subscribers agree to receive e-mail ad messages from the Company or one of the Company's advertisers. This type of agreement on behalf of a subscriber constitutes a permission-based opt-in. The Company operates exclusively in permission based advertising and is compliant with the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003.
Subscription process
In order for a subscriber to be considered opted-in he or she must agree to provide their email address plus mandatory personal information to InboxLabs, including gender, first name, last name, address and phone number. The subscribers can volunteer additional personal demographic information, such as age, income, occupation and more.
