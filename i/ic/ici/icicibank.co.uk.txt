AUTOMATED DECISION MAKING
If you apply to us for a product, your application may be processed by an automated decision-making process which may carry out credit and affordability assessment checks to determine whether your application will be accepted. Where these automated processes suggest that your application should be rejected, we will manually review your application before making a final decision. We may also use automated processes to decide credit limits.
We may also carry out automated anti-money laundering and sanctions checks. This means that we may automatically decide that you pose a fraud or money laundering risk if the processing reveals your behaviour to be consistent with that of known fraudsters or money launderers, is inconsistent with your previous submissions, or you appear to have deliberately hidden your true identity.
If we, or a fraud prevention agency, determine that you pose a fraud or money laundering risk: (i) we may refuse to provide the services you have requested, or we may stop providing existing services to you; and (ii) a record of any fraud or money laundering risk will be retained by the fraud prevention agencies, and may result in others refusing to provide services or employment to you.
If you have any questions about this, please contact us on the details set out below.

However, in order to be able to service your needs to the best of our ability, we may share any information you provide to us with our group companies and their agents, counterparties and support service or data providers, wherever located.

In the case of transfers by us, we may also transfer your information where the transfer is to a country deemed to provide adequate protection of your information by the European Commission or you have consented to the transfer.
