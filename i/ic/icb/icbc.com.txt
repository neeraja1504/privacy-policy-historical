Qmatic SMS texting service
ICBC sometimes allows visitors to our driver licensing offices to sign up for an SMS text message that will let them know when they are close to the front of the queue.
If you have signed up for this service, you will receive up to three text messages from us. The first message confirms your sign-up to the service and provides a link to contact us. The second message tells you to return to the office soon. The third message closes the ticket, and may include a link to a survey for you to provide your feedback.
If you have not signed up for this service and are receiving SMS text messages from us in error, or if you have decided you do not wish to be notified via SMS to return to the office, you can end the service by replying with STOP.
Changes to this privacy statement
ICBC may revise this privacy statement from time to time to reflect changes to our website, social media and online services.
