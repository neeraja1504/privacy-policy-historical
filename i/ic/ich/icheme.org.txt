Background
IChemE respects the privacy of its customers and aims to act consistently with the Data Protection Act 1998. IChemE will hold and use data contained on you for administrative purposes, to keep you informed of activities, and to offer goods and services provided by the Institution.
How we handle your personal information
Personal information is information or opinion that allows others to identify you. It includes your name, age, gender and contact details. It is the express wish of the Council that information relating to customers is available only to IChemE and not for direct access by third parties.
Collection of personal information
Generally, IChemE collects personal information directly from you. For example, we collect personal information when you:

IChemE's policy is not to disclose any personal Information that we hold on you to any unrelated third party, except where you have given your express consent for us to do so or where required by law.

We provide your email address to the Special Interest Groups of IChemE for the purpose of notifying you about events and activities of these groups.
If you tell us that you do not wish us to use your Personal Information for a particular purpose, we will not do so.
