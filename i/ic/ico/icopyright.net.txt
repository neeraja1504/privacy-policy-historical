Mandatory/Optional Information
Because copyright licensing (clearance) transactions involve a legal licensing agreement, iCopyright must collect accurate, current, and true information about each customer for each license transaction. Therefore, your name, e-mail address, business affiliation, and payment information are all mandatory information when you purchase reprints and other types of content licenses.
iCopyright collects certain optional information from users to provide the Clip&Copy service. This information is used to find and deliver relevant articles to users that match their defined topics.
Keeping and Sharing of Information
iCopyright will aggregate transaction records and demographic information and make that information available to content owners and others to assist them in providing relevant content and services to iCopyright customers. Reports of aggregated information provided or sold to third parties will contain no Personally Identifiable Information.
We may disclose Personally Identifiable Information to others as follows:
Each publisher or content owner may require that iCopyright disclose to it the names and other identifying information of the customers to whom the publisher’s rights or permissions have been granted as part of the legal licensing process. iCopyright does not control the use of such information by publishers/content owners.
Each service provider may require your name or other identifying information to fulfill a request that you make. You will be asked for this information at the time of each request. iCopyright does not control the use of such information by service providers.
iCopyright will disclose such information when required to do so by law or as requested by government or law enforcement authorities.
iCopyright maintains records of all licensing transactions, even if You cancel your account, so long as our agreements with content owners require us to, which is usually three (3) years.
