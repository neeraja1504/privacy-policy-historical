3. Accuracy
IconBAZAAR maintains the accuracy of our information by emailing, telephoning, faxing or mailing users who have made purchases from us, contracted us for custom design projects or other services, and made shareware donations to our web site.   These services are not offered as opt-in/opt-out services either by IconBAZAAR or our service providers.   Once you have been added voluntarily to our client database, by the act of making a purchase through our web site, by licensing materials from the IconBAZAAR, by making shareware donations to our web site, or by otherwise contracting for any services delivered by IconBAZAAR, this information becomes proprietary to IconBAZAAR and will be maintained indefinitely by IconBAZAAR in a reputable manner consistent with high moral and ethical standards.

5. Data Storage and Security
IconBAZAAR protects locally stored user information on firewalled systems which are not accessible to any person who is not employed by IconBAZAAR.   Currently, the only user information locally stored at our physical place of business resides on one computer.   This computer runs Windows XP SP2 with SpyBot - Search and Destroy, ZoneAlarm Pro Firewall among other security programs, accesses the Internet from behind a Linksys 4-port router (with internal firewall), and is BIOS password and Windows Logon password protected.
Our web site is hosted by PerlCoders on a dedicated server with firewalls in place.   At present, the only user information stored on the remote system hosted by PerlCoders is contained in our internet log files.   Access to these log files is available only through our server by use of an encrypted username and password.
