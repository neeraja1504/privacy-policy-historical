Return Policy
This is Frexy Studio’s Return Policy. Please read carefully before completing your purchase.
We work mainly in the digital format. The product you purchase or license from us is made up of little colored dots called pixels. These little bits of data are extremely easy to copy and send around to all your friends. They are also impossible to return, the way that traditional physical products, like shoes, toys, ect., can be returned. We cannot possibly know what happens to our digital content once you pay for and download it. Therefore, we cannot refund purchases of digital content, except in the following cases:
Partial return
The content in question is not at all what you were taking use of and you therefore may request a partial refund for any items that have not yet been worked on, you have not made copies of it nor sent it to anyone, and are willing to put that all in writing.
* ##### Full return
The content in question is not at all what you were expecting and you therefore cannot use it, you have not made copies of it nor sent it to anyone, and are willing to put that all in writing.
If you do wish to request a refund, please contact us within 24 hours of the transaction in question. Requests for refunds later than 24 hours after the transaction in question may not be honored and shall remain at our discretion.
In ANY case, in order to initiate the refund process, we require that you contact us first, via email, and try to resolve any issues with us directly, before contacting your credit card company. Unless we have a record of a conversation or correspondence with you regarding a request for a refund, we cannot authorize the refund of transactions previously completed. We reserve the right not to accept your request for a refund if you do not follow this protocol. We typically respond to inquiries within 5 business days. We reserve the right to refuse a refund we believe is based on a fraudulent claim.
However, we do care very much that you are satisfied with the content you have purchased, so if you have any difficulties, concerns, or questions, please send email to us at sales@iconeden.com.
