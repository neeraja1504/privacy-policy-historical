Do we need your consent to process Personal Data?
Whilst we always want you to be aware of how we are using your Personal Data, this does not
necessarily mean that we are required to ask for your consent before we can use it. In the day
to day business activities, we may use your Personal Data without asking for your consent, if:
•    processing is necessary for the performance of a contract, or is needed to enter into the
contract;
•    processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject to;

law, regulation, legal process or governmental request,
•   To complete an application or processes (requested by you),
•   In delivery of the Payment Services and the Platform Contract fulfilment, ICEPAY

International Transfers of Personal Data

ICEPAY is exclusively entitled to these transfers to third countries or international
organisations, unless a provision under EU law or under Member State law requires ICEPAY to

the Processing, unless that legislation prohibits such notification for serious reasons of general
interest.
Our operations are supported by a network of computers, cloud-based servers, and other
infrastructure and information technology, including, but not limited to, third-party service
providers. ICEPAY makes sure that the parties we cooperate with has the same level of privacy
protection as required under the GDPR, and in case of a transfer outside of the EU, we will
rely on corporate rules and contractual protections.
