For that reason, we ask that you do not send confidential information such as Social Security or account numbers to us through an unsecured email.

However, where such access is unreasonable, requires a disproportionate effort, jeopardizes the privacy of other iClassPro users, or contravenes the law, our policies, or reasonable business practice, requests to access data may be declined.
