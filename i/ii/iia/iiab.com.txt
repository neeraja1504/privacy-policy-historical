Privacy
Geekdom Pty Limited (Geekdom) is committed to respecting the privacy of your personal information. This Website Privacy Notice explains our policy for dealing with personal information that we collect through our website, iiab.com ™.

In addition to the provisions of this Website Privacy Notice, there may also be specific and additional privacy provisions that apply to certain sections of iiab.com ™. Because those specific and additional provisions also relate to your privacy protection, we recommend that you review them wherever they appear. In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of this Website Privacy Notice and those other specific and additional provisions, the specific and additional provisions will prevail.

We may set and access cookies on your computer. 'Cookies' are small identifiers sent from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive, similar to a license plate, that help us to recognize you if you visit our website again. Also our website use cookies to track how you found our website. Cookies are not designed to be used to get data from your hard drive, your email or any other personal information about you. To protect your privacy we do not use cookies to store or transmit any personal information about you on the Internet. You can reject cookies by changing your browser settings. Please note, however, that if you reject our cookies, it is possible that some web pages may not properly load, your access to certain information may be denied or you may have to enter information about you more than once.
3. Use and disclosure of information
We may share personal information with other service providers including organisations that assist us by providing archival, auditing, consulting, mailhouse, delivery, technology and security services.
In addition to providing our services to you, we may use or disclose personal information that we collect about you:
for the purposes for which it was collected
where you have consented to the use or disclosure
to maintain our relationship with you
where a third party acquires or wishes to acquire, or makes inquiries in relation to acquiring, an interest in Geekdom; or

5. Security
We use a number of mechanisms to protect the security and integrity of your personal information. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed as completely secure. So while we strive to protect such information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. Once any personal information comes into our possession, we will take reasonable steps to protect that information from misuse and loss and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.
iiab.com ™ protects your personal information by requiring you to use a password. For your own protection, we require you to keep this confidential and advise you to change your password regularly.
For your safety and protection, your credit card information is not stored on our servers. Our payment gateway provider, PayFlow, keeps this information encrypted and secure on your behalf.

Please provide as much detail as you can about the particular information you seek, in order to help us retrieve it. An access fee may be charged to cover our costs of providing the information to you.
