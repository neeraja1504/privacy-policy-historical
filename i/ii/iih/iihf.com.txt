What does this Privacy Policy Cover?

The Privacy Policy covers the treatment of personally identifiable information that is collected when You are on, use or register for the IIHF Digital Services, as described in the IIHF Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies or entities that the IIHF does not own or control, or to people that the IIHF does not employ or manage, including without limitation, third-party advertisers or sponsors to whom You provide information. The IIHF makes its content available on a variety of third party platforms like Facebook, Twitter or YouTube and these platforms are governed by their own terms and conditions and privacy policies that we strongly recommend You read.
How do we collect information from You?
The IIHF collects information when You access, use and/or register on the IIHF Digital Services, when You enter into transactions, promotions, or sweepstakes that are sponsored and/or offered by the IIHF directly or via IIHF Partners from time to time, and when You register for the IIHF Ice Times or similar. The IIHF may also collect certain information when you visit our Digital Services (as a non-registered user), through cookies, pixels and similar technologies.
What type of information is collected from You?
You may provide us with information, including personally identifiable information, when you register on the Services, create a user account, communicate with us, complete certain transactions or subscribe to Digital Services such as event registration, professional online resources or media alerts.

IIHF content preferences and promotional communications when lawful. To access certain
business resources, the IIHF may ask you to provide additional information such as your business
organization, job title, physical address, phone number and nationality.
The information requested will allow the IIHF to create and maintain Your user account and identify
you as one of our users.
Automatic Information: When You visit the IIHF website or certain IIHF digital properties, the IIHF
will use “cookies” to collect information. Cookies are small data files, which are transferred to a
computer’s hard disk to memorize information like registration IDs and passwords. A cookie will
typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has originated, the “lifetime” of the
cookie and various values.
The IIHF uses “first party cookies – ID cookies” to enable certain features on the IIHF website or
certain IIHF digital properties, to better understand how You interact with the IIHF website and
digital properties and to monitor aggregate usage by IIHF website and IIHF digital properties’
users and web traffic routing. The IIHF uses either session cookies (duration of Your visit) or
persistent cookies (stays on Your computer until You clear your browser).
The IIHF also uses “third party cookies” to enable certain services to us such as analytics and
advertising. For example the IIHF uses google analytics to be able to measure traffic and
performance of Digital Services.
You can always block cookies by updating Your web browser privacy settings. To do so, You will
have to access the “Help” menu in Your browser’s menu bar and search for the term “cookies”. If
You decline acceptance of cookies or block cookies, please note that You may experience less
customized experience on this Website.
Why do You have to Register?
The IIHF content is generally available on the Digital Services without the need to register as a
user. However, certain personalization options, transactions or services (such as e-commerce,
newsletters, professional services or event registration services) offered on IIHF Digital Services
require that you register with the IIHF and provide certain information about You.
How is Your Information Used?
The IIHF uses and processes Your personal information collected to:
Customize the content You see on IIHF Digital Services
For research, development and analytical purposes
To fulfill Your requests for certain products and/or services
​To communicate with You
For activities, promotions and/or campaigns of the IIHF or IIHF partners
To send You communication when You have opted-in to receive certain types of information from the IIHF.
The IIHF reviews its retention periods for personal information on a regular basis. The IIHF is
legally required to hold some types of information to fulfil our statutory obligations. The IIHF will
hold Your personal information on our systems for as long as is necessary for the relevant activity,
or as long as is set out in any relevant contract You hold with us.
Who has access to Your personal information?
The IIHF will not sell or rent Your personal information to third parties. The IIHF will not share Your
information with third parties for marketing purposes.
Third Party Service Providers working on IIHF’s behalf: the IIHF may pass Your personal
information to our third-party service providers, agents, subcontractors and other associated
organizations for the purposes of completing tasks and providing services to You on our behalf (for
example to analyze IIHF Digital Platform fan usage, infrastructure and general IT services, email
communications and push notifications, accreditation, arranging travel or accommodation, etc.).
However, when the IIHF uses third party service providers, the IIHF discloses only the personal
information that is necessary to deliver the service. Further, we have a contract in place that
ensure confidentiality and requires them to keep Your information secure and not to use it for their
own direct marketing purposes. Please be assured that we will not release Your personal
information to third parties beyond the IIHF network for them to use for their own direct marketing
purposes, unless you have requested us to do so, or we are required to do so by law, for example,
by a court or for the purpose of prevention of fraud or other crimes.
Third Party Product Providers the IIHF works in association with: the IIHF works closely with
various other third-party product providers (for example the IIHF Official World Championship
Merchandizing Partner and IIHF Championships Authorized Ticket Brokers) and various IIHF
Partners (NIKE, GRAF, etc.) which have links to their website via IIHF website or digital properties.
When utilizing Your information, the third-party service provider and IIHF Partner will be acting as
the data controller of Your information. The IIHF partners and third-party product provider, and not
the IIHF, are responsible for the treatment of your personal information when the IIHF partners or
third-party product provider utilize Your personal information. If You choose to directly register with
an IIHF partner or third-party product provider’s websites at the same time You register with the
IIHF Digital Services, the terms of the Privacy Policy of the IIHF partner or third-party service shall
be incorporate herein by reference.
How do we Protect Your Personal Information?
Data Security: The IIHF has adopted reasonable security measures, appropriate to the sensitivity
of the personal information, against unauthorized access, disclosure, loss or destruction of
personal information. These measures may include technological, physical and organization
methods of security. However, the Internet is an open system and we cannot guarantee that
unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use your personal
information for improper purposes.
If You communicate with the IIHF by email, You should note that the secrecy of Internet email is
uncertain. By sending sensitive or confidential email messages or information which is not
encrypted You accept the risk of such uncertainty and possible lack of confidentiality over the
Internet.
International Transfer: Your information is primarily processed in Switzerland and the European
Union but may be stored and used elsewhere depending on the location of affiliates, partners, and
other entities who are permitted to access such information under the terms of this Privacy Policy
(for example a company helping us provide a Digital Service). Such other locations, like the United
States of America, do not provide in their laws the level of protection of your privacy equivalent to
the one applied in the European Union or Switzerland. By accessing, using or registering for the
IIHF Digital Services or submitting personal information to the IIHF, you specifically agree to the
transfer any related purpose.
Children’s Privacy: The IIHF does not knowingly collect personal information from Children. The
IIHF does not take specific steps to protect the privacy of children who disclose their personal
information to the IIHF. If the IIHF becomes aware that a child has provided us with person
information without parental consent, we will take steps to delete this information and close the
child’s account.
