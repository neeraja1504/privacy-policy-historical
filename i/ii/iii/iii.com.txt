By visiting or using the Site, you are agreeing to the terms of this Policy.  If you do not agree with this policy, do not access or use this Site, our Services, or interact with any other aspect of our business.
This Policy does not apply to information that Innovative collects through means other than the Site and its offline interactions, including information that we collect about a customer’s library employees, a customer’s library patrons, and others through our software, cloud solutions, professional services, and mobile applications.  To learn more about how Innovative handles information in these contexts, please refer to the Innovative Services Privacy Policy, available here.
What Information We Collect
We collect Personal Information in connection with the Site and offline interactions, as described below.  For purposes of this Policy, “Personal Information” is any information or combination of information that can be used to identify, contact, or locate you.
Personal Information. _   _We collect various types of Personal Information from or about visitors to the Site and in offline interactions, including:

contact information, including mailing address, email address, social media handle, or phone number
state, region, or country
the Innovative products you use

comments and questions, and any other information you choose to provide.
We collect this information through forms that you may fill out on our Site, when you contact us with questions, or when you sign up for one of our events.  With regard to offline collection, we may gather this information from email exchanges, phone calls or other direct interactions with you outside of the Site.
We may collect additional Personal Information from other sources that we combine with the kinds of Personal Information described above. In these circumstances, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information in accordance with this Policy. Combined information helps us to update, expand and analyze our records, identify new customers, and provide products and services that may be of interest to you. If you provide us with Personal Information about others, or if others give us your Personal Information, we will only use that information for the specific reason for which it was provided.
Examples of the types of Personal Information that may be obtained from other sources and combined with information we already have about you through the Site may include:
information found publicly (such as available social media sites and profiles, your company’s website, professional directories, and industry publications) in order to provide you more personalized and relevant experiences and offers; and
our communications with you via email or phone as well as your customer service and/or sales records with us in order to provide you more relevant experiences and offers and to fulfill the purposes described in this policy.
Passive Collection and Tracking Technologies.   ** ** As is true of most websites, we gather some Personal Information automatically through the Site in our server logs (described below).  This may include information such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and domain name, your Internet Service Providers (ISP), the date and time of your visit, your use of the Site (including the pages you view and the files you download), referring/exit pages, your computer’s operating system and browser type, your software and hardware attributes (including device IDs), your general geographic location (e.g., your city, state, or metropolitan region), and/or clickstream data to analyze trends in the aggregate and administer the Site.
We collect Personal Information using tools and technologies such as:
Server Logs.  When you use the Site, we automatically receive and record certain information from your computer (or device) and browser.  To obtain such information, we may use server logs or applications that recognize your computer or device and gather information about its online activity.
Cookies _.  _To make this Site work properly, we place small data files called cookies on your device. Most big websites do this too.
What are cookies?  Cookies are small text files that a website saves on your computer or mobile device when you visit the site. It enables the website to remember your actions, information, and preferences (such as login, email, language, font size and other display preferences) over a period of time, so you don’t have to keep re-entering them whenever you come back to the site or browse from one page to another.
How do we use cookies?  Innovative uses cookies or similar technologies to personalize content and ads, provide a responsive website experience, analyze our website traffic and trends, administer the Site, track users’ movements around the Site, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
How to control cookies.  If you are concerned about having cookies on your computer, you can control and/or delete cookies as you wish. However, if you choose to block or delete cookies, certain features of the Site may not operate correctly.
You can delete all cookies that are already on your computer and you can set most browsers to prevent them from being placed. If you do this, however, you may have to manually adjust some preferences every time you visit a site and some services and functionalities may not work.
You can set your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being set, allowing you to decide whether to accept it.
For details, see www.aboutcookies.org.
Pixel Tags.  The Site or the emails you receive from us may use an application known as a “pixel tag,” (also called a “clear gif” or a “web beacon”).  A pixel tag is an electronic tracking mechanism that usually consists of a single-pixel image.  It can be embedded in a web page or in an email to transmit information, which could include Personal Information.  For example, pixel tags may be used by an email sender to determine whether an email recipient has opened a particular email.
Javascript.  We use Javascript code on the Site to produce more interactive and dynamic features. Javascript can create cookies, read cookies, and delete cookies.
ETag.  We use ETags (or “entity tags”) on the Site. Etags are HTTP headers that are sent behind-the-scenes between a web browser and a web server.
Our partners may also use cookies or similar technologies on the Site. To learn more about third-party tracking technologies and choices available to you, please read the “Third-Party Tracking Technologies and Interest-Based Advertising” section below.

Third-Party Tracking Technologies and Interest-Based Advertising

They may also set and access cookies on your computer or device.  For example, our Site uses Google Analytics to help collect and analyze certain information for the purposes discussed in this Policy.  You may opt out of the use of cookies by Google Analytics here.
The Site may also enable third-party tracking mechanisms to collect information over time and across unaffiliated websites for use in online behavioral advertising.  For example, third parties may use the fact that you visited the Site to target online ads for our services to you on other websites.  In addition, our third-party advertising partners might use information about your use of the Site to help target other company’s advertisements based on your online behavior in general.  For information about behavioral advertising practices, including privacy and confidentiality, visit the Network Advertising Initiative website or the Digital Advertising Alliance website.
The use of online tracking mechanisms by third parties is subject to those third parties’ own privacy policies, and not this Policy.  If you prefer to prevent third parties from setting and accessing cookies on your computer, you may set your browser to block cookies.  Additionally, you may remove yourself from the targeted advertising of companies by opting out here or, if located in the European Union, you may opt out here. Please note you will continue to receive generic ads.
