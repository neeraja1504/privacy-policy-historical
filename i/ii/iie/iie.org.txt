IIE Programs and sponsored Programs we administer may have additional or different data privacy policies and practices. These are disclosed at the points where data is collected for those Programs.

Information We Collect Automatically
When you interact with the Website, we automatically collect information about your use of the Website from your browser in the Website server logs. Whenever you request a page through your browser, the navigation and clickstream data, such as your IP address, browser (and version), operating system, date, time, and the site from which you came are stored in a log file. We use software to create summaries from these statistics so we can evaluate content worth, Website and system administration, and anonymous user analysis. We use “cookie” technology on our Website. Cookies let us identify a user’s computer (so, for example, you won’t have to log in every time you visit the Website), and can help make it easier to navigate through the Website (cookies can record a user’s preferences and other data about the user’s Website visit).
When you use the Website for the first time, cookies that are essential to make the Website operate (“essential cookies”) will have been set, but other cookies will not have been set unless you agreed to those cookies being set at that time. If you have agreed to accept cookies, then the Website will remember this and continue to set cookies each time you visit.
Some cookies are deleted when you close your browser. These are known as “session cookies.” Others remain on your device until they expire or you delete them. These are known as “persistent cookies.” They enable us to remember things about you as a returning visitor. If you do not want cookies to be stored, you may turn off cookies individually, or you can select the appropriate options on your web browser to delete some or all cookies. However, if you block some or all cookies (including essential cookies) you may not be able to use or access all or parts of the Website, such as being able to log on to member specific areas.

Please note that Google and other third parties (including, for example, advertising networks and providers of external services like web traffic analysis services) may also use cookies as a result of your visiting other websites.
Because an industry-standard Do-Not-Track protocol has not yet been established, our information collection practices on our Site will continue to operate as described in this Privacy Policy regardless of any “Do Not Track” signals that may be sent by certain browsers. However, you may refuse to accept cookies in order to prevent tracking activities.
Sharing Personal Information
We may share your Personal Information with:
our IIE offices and affiliates,
our service providers and other third parties that make the Website available, enhance its functionality or otherwise provide services to IIE or its service providers,
any other person or entity about which we tell you when you provide your Personal Information,
and any other person or entity necessary for protecting the rights or safety of IIE or others.
We will not sell, market, share, rent or otherwise distribute your Personal Information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this Policy. Except as otherwise expressly stated in this Policy, we will release Personal Information to another person or company only with your consent or if required or permitted by law. If your Personal Information will be disclosed to any other recipients than are stated in this Policy, we will inform you at the time we collect your Personal Information and obtain your consent.
We do reserve the right to transfer your Personal Information and other information to our successors in business and purchasers or transferees of any of our assets.
Bulletin Boards and Chat Areas
Personal Information that you voluntarily disclose and transmit online may be viewed and used by others. Users of the Website are solely responsible for the content of messages and other content they post online, including on public forums. These forums include, but are not limited to, on and offsite chat rooms, bulletin boards, blogs or other publicly accessible forums that may be viewed and used by anyone with access to such forums. You should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose Personal Information within a public forum, your information may be collected and used by others. We cannot control such uses of your Personal Information, and by using such services you assume the risk that the Personal Information provided by you may be viewed and used by third parties.
International Transfers
We store and process your Personal Information in various countries worldwide including the United States. We may transfer and access such information from around the world, including the United States and other countries in which we operate or in which our hosted service providers’ cloud servers are located so that we can use the information as described in this Policy.
IIE operates this Website from the United States, which has not been deemed to offer adequate data protection by the European Commission. If you provide your Personal Information to us, be aware you are doing so on the basis that you explicitly consent to the transfer of your Personal Information outside the EEA. The potential consequence of you explicitly consenting to this is that there is a risk that your Personal Information will not be protected in a manner that complies with European Data Protection Legislation. You can withdraw your consent to such international transfers by contacting us at siteinfo@iie.org, but if you do, we will not be able to contact you about our Programs and services we may be able to offer you going forward. Where we pass your Personal Information from an IIE entity or office inside the EEA to IIE parties located outside the EEA that do not offer adequate protection as determined by the European Commission, we do this under a data sharing agreement that includes the appropriate EU model international data transfer clauses to make sure your personal information is protected. Where IIE makes transfers of personal information outside IIE to another organization and if they are not subscribed to an approved data protection framework, such as the EU-US Privacy Shield, that permits the transfer of Personal Information to them from the EEA, we rely on the use of the EU model international data transfer clauses if the country the receiving organization is located in is not listed as ‘adequate’ by the European Commission. A copy of the terms of these agreements, signed by the recipient, can be obtained by contacting us at siteinfo@iie.org.
Security of Personal Information
While we undertake every reasonable effort to prevent unauthorized Internet access to Personal Information we collect, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of information you transmit to us, information provided online, or information stored by us or our service providers. You submit your Personal Information at your own risk. We are not liable for disclosures of your Personal Information due to errors in transmission or the acts of our service providers or other third parties. This means you accept all risks associated with any data transmission and Internet usage, including the risk that your Personal Information may be intercepted in transit.
External Links
The Website contains links to third party websites. Unless we state otherwise in writing, IIE makes no representations whatsoever concerning the content or privacy practices or data protection standards of those websites. Our link to a site is not an endorsement, authorization, sponsorship, or affiliation regarding the website, its owners, or its providers. There are risks associated with using any information, software, or products found on the Internet, and IIE cautions you to make sure that you understand these risks before retrieving, using, relying upon, or purchasing anything via the Internet. If you leave the Website and visit other sites, you should carefully read the privacy statements of other websites that collect Personal Information. These other websites may collect or solicit personal data or send their own cookies to your computer. IIE is not responsible for the privacy practices of other websites.
This Policy applies only to this Website and not to any webpages not a part of this Website, even if there are hyperlinks from this Website to another website. As an example, you may decide to connect with us through social media providers that are provided by third parties. The collection, processing, or use of information by such a third party is subject to that third party’s terms of use and privacy policy, and IIE is not responsible for their actions.
