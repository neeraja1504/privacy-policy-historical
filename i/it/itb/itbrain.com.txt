2. Information concerning your responsible use of IoT
When you use IoT, we are providing the product to you as a technical service that you may reasonably use. We technically assist you, as a processor, with the use of the platform for your IoT decives. You are responsible for utilizing TeamViewer in accordance with the applicable laws, including data protection laws. The following section explains to you how IoT works.
A. Personal Data processed through your use of IoT
When you use IoT, we receive information such as the amount of devices connected through IoT, log in time and date, functionalities used and metrics**** entered while you use IoT. Depending on the metrics defined by you in the IoT (the so-called metadata), we also receive data from devices that you connect with IoT (e.g. the temperature of a device or other metrics, as defined by you). While generally such kind of data in and of itself typically includes no personal data, we cannot exclude that you collect information that – either in itself or in connection with additional information – may be linked to individual persons (e.g. maintenance staff for an IoT device). It is therefore your responsibility to ensure that data collection through your IoT devices is fair, transparent and in line with applicable data protection laws.
B. Data Usage
TeamViewer is using all of the personal data described in section II. A. in order to provide you with the functionalities of IoT as agreed in the End User License Agreement and the Performance Specification and in accordance with the data processing provisions in section C. of the End User License Agreement where additional information on security measures is available. To improve IoT’s functionalities, TeamViewer uses Hotjar to assist with the diagnosis of technical problems and to analyze user behavior trends. Hotjar is a software as a service tracking tool offered by Hotjar limited, Level 2, St. Julian’s Business Center, 3, Elia Zammit Street, St. Julians, Malta. Hotjar is only activated from time to time, mostly when updates are released. Hotjar collects information about the device that is used to log in to the TeamViewer IoT, such as the device’s IP address (captured and stored in an anonymized format); device screen resolution; device type (unique device identifiers), operating system, and browser type, geographic location (country only), preferred language used to display the Hotjar enabled site, mouse events (movements, location and clicks), keypressers, referring URL and domain, pages visited, geographic location (country only), date and time of access. The sole purpose of collecting this data is to improve the functionality of IoT. TeamViewer does not store the data collected through Hotjar for longer than 24 hours and masks the user’s private information. The user can object to the use of Hotjar here: https://www.hotjar.com/opt-out/ and can learn about Hotjar’s ability to use and share information through the Hotjar Terms & Conditions of Use, available at https://www.hotjar.com/terms/, and the Hotjar Privacy Policy, available at https://www.hotjar.com/privacy/.
We will not share personal data with local authorities or courts except where we are required to do so by applicable law, a court order or a legally binding injunction.
C. Data Subjects Rights
Data subjects may exercise certain rights in relation to the processing of their personal data through TeamViewer towards you. As your technical service provider we may assist you to answer such request as described in the data processing agreement in section C of the End User License Agreement. Such rights might be accessing personal data, rectification, erasure, restriction of processing, data portability and objection to the processing. Data subjects have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority in relation to the processing of their personal data.
Should you have any questions on the processing of personal data through TeamViewer, please contact privacy@teamviewer.com.

IV. What types of cookies are being used?

In some cases, the information derived from these cookies may allow us to associate information with an identifiable individual. Further information on different cookie types is provided below. Please refer to the full list of cookies that TeamViewer uses for more information in Annex 1.:
Session Cookies
Session cookies last only for the duration of your visit of our website and are deleted when you close your browser. These help us to identify that a user of a particular device is navigating from page to page, supporting website security or basic functionality.

Persistent cookies
Persistent cookies continue to exist even after you have closed your browser, and allow a website to remember your actions and preferences, particularly remember you as an existing user.

TeamViewer uses persistent cookies in a few ways, for example, _ga- Google Analytics cookie registers a unique ID used to distinguish users.
Both session as well as persistent cookies can serve different purposes and may be placed either by TeamViewer or by a third party:
Strictly necessary cookies

V. Tracking in our emails
Just like the cookies we use on our websites, TeamViewer uses cookies and similar technologies, such as beacons, pixels, and tags, in some emails. This is for example the case when you receive an email from us: TeamViewer will know whether you open, read, or delete the message. If you click on a link provided to you in a marketing email, TeamViewer will use a cookie to receive information on what pages you visit, what content you download, and whether you are a signed into one of our products. Web beacons for example, which are small invisible images placed in emails, will tell us if you’ve opened the email and read it, which email software and web browser you use, which device you use and your IP address. We also use web beacons to help us display emails in the best format for your device. Sometimes TeamViewer may use advance technologies like Link tracking. These functions based on the number of hyperlinks, each of which has a unique tag. When you click on one of these links the mailing company logs the click so that we can understand who has clicked through from an email to our website. We use this information to tailor future messages to you.
