How the University of Twente handles your personal details
The University of Twente makes every effort to protect your privacy. In this privacy statement we will explain how we handle your personal details. We process personal details in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
This statement applies to information that is collected and used in computerized systems within the University of Twente, including our websites. This statement does not apply to websites that mention the University of Twente, but whose content we are unable to influence directly.
Collecting your personal details
The University of Twente collects personal details if this is necessary in order to provide services, conduct transactions, distribute information or grant access. The information that we collect is always intended for a specific purpose; in other words we do not collect more information than is necessary for that purpose. We may collect information on the following categories of data subjects:
Students
Staff, including applicants and doctoral candidates
Prospective students
Alumni
External staff, including guest employees
Personal details are usually provided by the data subject. If necessary, this information may be sent to or entered into another system within the university, from an internal source system. We also receive personal details from the systems of third parties, which may be closed source systems such as Studielink or an open source system such as Twitter.
We may also collect your details if you leave them on the university’s websites, in order to keep you informed of the diverse activities at the university.
It is also permitted to collect personal information within the university within the framework of scientific research. This concerns the personal details of participants in a study. This information is processed in accordance with the law and the ‘Code of conduct for the use of personal details in scientific research’ (VSNU). If medical details are involved, Federa’s relevant codes of conduct will also apply (the codes on ‘Good conduct’ and ‘Proper Use’). If necessary, the study will be assessed beforehand by the university’s ethical committee.

The data we collected can be used for statistical and scientific research. We always act in accordance with the legal requirements.
Website and web systems
The University of Twente uses various tools to make its websites more user-friendly and to ensure that they function optimally. This includes measuring surfing behaviour using web statistics and other systems that are integrated into the website to collect active feedback from users or to conduct research with various versions of websites.
In order to show users more relevant content that is tailored to their situation, information on some parts of websites may be personalized on the basis of information that users have filled in earlier, their location/country or on the basis of other choices made on the website.
Contact by Email
We roughly distinguish two types of automated email: transactional email that you have initiated/requested yourself, and recruiting email. Transactional email is an essential part of a service that you have chosen, such as resetting a password or confirming an application or a request for information. You therefore cannot unsubscribe for this type of email.
If you have consented to receiving recruiting emails such as newsletters or invitations to events, you may withdraw your consent. This type of email has opt-out options. Due to the decentralized nature of email communication, there is no university-wide opt-out option.
Just as for the websites, the University of Twente uses analysis tools to analyse the reading and clicking behaviour for newsletters in order to analyse and improve our newsletters. Linking this information to your personal details enables us to send you more relevant email communications or interest-related information.

Retention period
Your personal details will not be kept for longer than is necessary to achieve the objectives for which they were collected and processed. An exception may be made if it is necessary to keep information for historical, statistical or scientific purposes or on the grounds of a statutory regulation.
Protection of your personal details
