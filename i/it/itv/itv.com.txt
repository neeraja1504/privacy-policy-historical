How will we use your information?
We and our authorised third parties will only process your personal information where we have legal grounds to do so. The legal grounds for processing differ depending on which of our products and services you use. Generally, we’ll only process your data on the following grounds:
you have given consent for the processing. When we rely on consent to process your personal information, you always have the right to withdraw this consent;

the processing is necessary in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract;
the processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation placed on ITV (for example our obligation to ensure that the data we hold is accurate);
the processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by ITV or by a third party. For example, we have a legitimate interest in understanding how people are using our products and services, both to improve them, to sell adverts more effectively and to promote our services. Therefore, we use your personal information to understand and analyse use of our products and services.

Processing Based on Legitimate Interests
Where any of the activities set out below involve the use of cookies or similar technologies, additional information (including about how you can disable them) is displayed to you before such cookies are installed and can also be found in our Cookie Policy at www.itv.com/cookies.
Direct Marketing
We use your data to promote or market our or third party products or services to you via direct marketing in the following circumstances.
Do we use cookies?
We, and our authorised third parties, use cookies and/or other similar technologies or tools (collectively referred to as “cookies”) to store and sometimes track information about you. We also access certain information stored on the devices you use to access our products and services. For more details about what cookies are, the cookies we use and how to disable them, please see our Cookie Policy at www.itv.com/cookies and service-specific privacy notices (where applicable).
How long do we keep your information?
We keep your personal information for only as long as necessary, which is longer in some cases than in others. The length of this retention period depends on the purpose for which the data was obtained and its nature. For example:
we need to keep some personal information about you so we can deal with any complaints you might make about the products and services we provide to you;
if you ask us to stop processing your personal information for direct marketing, we need to retain enough information about you to enable us to ensure we stop including you in those direct marketing activities;
we need to keep personal information so we can defend possible future legal claims. Unless there’s some other reason for keeping it, personal information will be deleted when such a claim could no longer arise or it is no longer required in order to defend legal claims that have arisen;
we have a legal or regulatory duty to retain particular personal information for a certain minimum period (for example under Ofcom rules, or under HMRC tax rules).
We do need to share your personal data with third parties in some circumstances. We pass information about you to other parties as follows:
to third parties authorised by us and acting on our behalf, such as our employees, contractors,partners, suppliers, auditors and/or agents, to administer the products and services provided to you and/or to help us review and improve these products and services (including reviewing the accuracy of our data and checking how effective we are at making content relevant to you). These third parties are only allowed access to your information as needed to perform functions of the products and services or to provide services to us. They’re not allowed to use it for any other purpose;
to reputable third parties such as broadcasters to enable you to have a better cross-platform advertising experience (see “ Making advertising and marketing on other services more relevant to you ” above);
where ITV Box Office stores details to enable repeat purchases via the Sky remote control. If you want to opt-out of this processing please send an email from your registered email address to itvboxofficesupport@itv.com;
for marketing communications, where we have your consent to do so (see section above on “ Direct Marketing ");
to conduct analytics in relation to our products and services; including with regard to our user base, sales patterns, traffic volumes and related matters. This could include comparing the information we hold about you against third party datasets;
so that our products and services can be marketed to you on third party platforms (for example, Facebook or our Facebook Fan Pages);
for the purpose of industry measurement (for example by the Broadcasters Audience ResearchBoard);
to the police, regulatory bodies or legal advisers in connection with any alleged criminal offence, unlawful activity or suspected breach of the Terms of Use and/or the breach of other terms and conditions or otherwise where required by law or where we suspect harm or potential harm to others. We will cooperate with any law enforcement authorities or court order requesting or directing us to disclose the identity or location of or any other information about anyone breaching any relevant terms and conditions or otherwise for the prevention or detection of crime or the apprehension or prosecution of offenders;
where relevant, the user name and some profile information you voluntarily provide may be published on areas of the products and services such as forums, leaderboards,chat rooms or pages where user submissions are displayed, and this will be the identity by which you are known on those areas;

What are your rights?
Any personal information you supply will be treated in accordance with applicable data protection laws including the Data Protection Act 2018 and the General DataProtection Regulation (the “GDPR”) and any other applicable or superseding legislation. We are committed to delivering the rights that individuals are entitled to under data protection laws in the UK. These are:
the right to request a copy of the personal information we hold about you. To do this, please contact us at viewerservices@itv.com making clear that you are requesting a copy of your personal information and including full details of what you require. You may also be required to submit a proof of your identity.
the right to object to your personal information being used for direct marketing. Where required we will ensure we obtain your consent before undertaking marketing and you will have the ability to opt out (see the section on ‘ Direct Marketing ’ above).
the right to object to your personal information being processed where the legal basis for the processing is our own legitimate interests as a business (see ‘ How will we use your information?’section above). In some circumstances (for example, where we are using cookies or in respect of personalising editorial content or advertising or marketing) we have specific mechanisms to enable this objection. In all cases, we will comply with such a request unless there is a lawful reason for not doing so, such as when we need to continue to process your information to defend a legal claim or if this information is necessary for the ongoing provision of our products and services.
the right to rectification. You may request that we correct any inaccurate and/or complete any incomplete personal information.
the right to withdraw consent. Where we are processing your personal information on the basis that you have given us your consent to do so, you may withdraw your consent at any time.
the right of erasure. You may request that we erase your personal information and we will comply, unless there is a lawful reason for not doing so. For example, there may be an overriding legitimate ground for retaining your personal information, such as keeping your payment information for several years to comply with HMRC rules.
the right to data portability. In certain circumstances, you may request that we provide your personal information to you in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format and have it transferred to another provider of the same or similar services to us. Where this right is applicable, we will comply with such transfer as far as it is technically feasible.
the right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority. We suggest that you contact us about any questions or if you have a complaint in relation to how we process your personal information. However, you do have the right to contact the relevant supervisory authority directly. To contact the Information Commissioner’s Office in the United Kingdom, please visit the ICO website (www.ico.org.uk) for instructions.
Product/service providers based outside Europe
We use certain third party companies to perform some functions of the products and services on our behalf or to provide services to us. These third parties are only allowed access to your information as needed to perform such functions or to provide such services. They’re not allowed to use it for any other purpose.
Some of these third party companies are located, or have servers that are located, outside the UK and European Economic Area. Where we share your information with such companies, we take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure your information is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy notice.
However, please note that the data protection and other laws of such countries may not be as comprehensive as those in the UK or European Economic Area. We’ll only transfer your personal information to a territory outside of the UK or European Economic Area under the following circumstances:
the European Commission or UK government has determined that an adequate level of protection for personal information is in place in the country to which we transfer your data;
standard data protection clauses as adopted by the European Commission or UK government are in place governing the transfer (you can view the standard clauses on the European Union’s legal website at eur-lex.europa.eu);
for transfers to the USA, the recipient organisation is a participant in the EU-US Privacy Shield programme (or equivalent with the UK as and when created); or
other appropriate safeguards have been put in place, as described in the privacy notice for the applicable product/service.
Changes to our business
If we decide to change or restructure our business we may need to pass your personal information to one of our group companies so we can continue to effectively deliver the products and services to you.
Also, if we become involved in a merger, acquisition, restructuring, reorganisation or other transaction involving the sale of some or all of our group companies’ assets, then your information may be included in the assets that are transferred to the new owner and may be provided to the entities and advisors involved.Such a transaction could involve us: (i) retaining the right to continue to use transferred personal information in addition to the right of the new owner to use such information; and (ii) engaging in additional transfers of personal information (including new personal information) with the new owner from time to time following such a transaction.
If there are changes to our business (such as a re-organisation or restructuring), your personal information will remain subject to this privacy notice (as amended from time to time). However, where your personal information is transferred to a new owner following a merger or acquisition it may be subject to a different privacy notice. We, or the new owner, will provide notice to you before any of your personal information becomes subject to a different privacy notice.
