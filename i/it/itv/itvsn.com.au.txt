Collection of Information
TVSN and DG only collects and stores your information if there is a legal basis to do so, such as:
you have given TVSN your consent;
you wish to make a purchase from us; or
another legal basis under Australian or New Zealand Law.
Occasionally, we may collect personal information about you from someone else. For example, someone may give us your name and address if they have purchased a gift for you and/or would like us to deliver a gift to you. If you provide us with personal information of another person, such as a gift recipient, you agree to take reasonable steps to ensure that person is made aware of the matters set out in this Policy and they understand how their details will be used.
What kinds of information do we collect and hold?
Personal information.
This is the basic information we collect about you like your name, your address and your contact information (e.g. email, phone, mobile, fax, etc.) and other information that may identify you.
Sometimes, you may voluntarily disclose other information to us in the course of your dealings with us or with our representatives. If this information comprises or contains one or both of unsolicited personal information or sensitive personal information, such information will be further dealt with as set out below.
TVSN will only ever collect your personal information in accordance with our Policy and as agreed between yourself and us.
Personal Data
This can include, passwords, emails or other digital information and, if you make payment to us or receive payment from us, your credit card information, debit card information, EFT information, bank account and similar financial information.
We will only collect sensitive personal data only when there is a specific need to do so and with your express consent.
With your consent personal data may be collected and stored electronically for future transactions.
You may request TVSN to remove credit card information, debit card information, EFT information, bank account and similar financial information by calling 13 23 10 (AUS) 0800 101 301 (NZ) once this request has been actioned you will be required to re-enter payment details for each subsequent purchase.
You also have the right to the erasure of your personal data where:
the personal data is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or processed;
you withdraw consent for us to use or keep the personal data and there is no other legal ground for us to use or keep the personal data; or
the personal data has been unlawfully processed.
How we collect information
Generally, we collect your personal information directly either from you (when you provide your contact details to us in letters, emails, faxes, phone calls, social media postings and other online postings) or from third parties. We also collect information about you indirectly through browser tracking cookies, mobile app reporting and webpage pixel tags and any other online activities when you use our website and apps.
To the extent it would be impracticable to obtain consent directly from you, we also collect other personal information about you from time to time from third party sources where it is relevant to the conduct of our business functions and activities (such as credit scoring information and consumer preference information).
Please note that most of the information we collect indirectly is not personal information (since it cannot identify you individually) but some may be (especially when held or used in combination with other information we hold about you).
Please note that as we expand and extend the digital platforms and other software tools we make available to you, we may collect device-specific information (e.g. information relating to a specific phone or tablet), log information, GPS/WiFi location information and other tracking information; such information may also constitute personal information if it identifies you.
How we hold information
We treat the storage of your information seriously and aim to ensure we securely store any information we may hold about you. In addition to storing your letters and faxes in physical files, we use a number of electronic systems to record and store your personal and other information, this can include call recording systems, customer notes systems, customer database systems and web database systems (including online forms and/or online ordering).
If we store sensitive personal information or personal information for any reason it is only to meet the needs of a particular program or activity and any applicable legislative requirements. If that purpose is no longer applicable, sensitive personal information is deleted, we may still keep your email or contact information in order to supply to you newsletters or other marketing information.

Miscellaneous
Your dealings with us
Because it makes it impracticable for us to carry out many of our core business functions and activities, you cannot normally deal with us anonymously or under another name (pseudonymously). However, if and where dealing with us anonymously or pseudonymously is practicable in respect of particular matters we will make that option available.
Unsolicited personal information
If in the course of communications with us or our representatives, you provide unsolicited personal information, we will review that information. If, upon review, that unsolicited information is relevant to our business functions or activities, we may hold, use or disclose that personal information consistently with your reason for disclosing it.
Sensitive personal information
(AUS) Please note that we do not seek to collect from you health information or other sensitive information as defined by Australian Law. However, if unsolicited personal information provided by you also includes health information or other sensitive information as defined by Australian Law, you consent to us holding, using or disclosing such health information or other sensitive personal information consistently with your reason for disclosing it (for example, resolving a customer complaint).
(NZ) We will apply the same principles as above to the same kinds of personal information of New Zealand residents.
Partial identification in commercial communications
Sometimes in the course of our commercial communications (e.g. communication of written testimonials, product conversations, product-related tweets or similar), we may partially identify an individual by reference to part of that individual’s name and an area (e.g. suburb, region or state). To the extent that such information might identify you as an individual, you nevertheless consent to us holding, using or disclosing your personal information in that way.
