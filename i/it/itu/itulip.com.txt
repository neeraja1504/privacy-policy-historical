What this Privacy Policy Covers
This privacy policy covers the Web site iTulip.com.   iTulip.com does not currently charge any fees to access iTulip.com web site content but reserves the right to charge a nominal fee for access to some content in the future.  Other iTulip.com sites linked to from this Web site, such as f4thcurrency.com, have their own privacy statements which can be viewed on those sites.

Security
Your information is stored on iTulip.com Web servers hosted by Bluehost (http://www.bluehost.com) a Web hosting company based in the United States.  Bluehost uses various procedural and technical safeguards to protect information against loss or theft as well as unauthorized access and disclosure to protect information, including encryption, "firewalls" and Secure Socket Layers. Bluehost employs many different security techniques to protect such data from unauthorized access by users inside and outside the company. However, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet.
