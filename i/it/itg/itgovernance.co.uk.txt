2. To initiate and complete commercial transactions with you, or the entity that you represent, for the purchase of products and/or services.
3. To fulfil a contract that we have entered into with you or with the entity that you represent. In these circumstances it may be your entity, rather than yourself, that has provided us with your personal data.

The table in section 5 below provides more detail about the data that we collect for each of these purposes, the lawful basis for doing so, and the period for which we will retain each type of data.

In addition, to ensure that each visitor to any of our websites can use and navigate the site effectively, we collect the following:
Technical information, including the IP (Internet Protocol) address used to connect your device to the Internet.
Your login information, browser type and version, time zone setting, browser plug-in types and versions.

Our cookies policy, which can be viewed from the home page of each of our web sites, describes in detail how we use cookies.
In section 8 below, we identify your rights in respect of the personal data that we collect and describe how you can exercise those rights.
5. Lawful basis for the processing of personal data
The table below describes the various forms of personal data we collect and the lawful basis for processing this data. Our business architecture, accounting and systems infrastructure and compliance organisation means that all personal data is processed on common, group-wide platforms. We have processes in place to make sure that only those people in our organisation who need to access your data can do so. A number of data elements are collected for multiple purposes, as the table below shows. Some data may be shared with third parties; where this happens, this is also identified below.
When we process on the lawful basis of legitimate interest, we apply the following test to determine whether it is appropriate:
The purpose test – is there a legitimate interest behind the processing?
Necessity test – is the processing necessary for that purpose?
Balancing test – is the legitimate interest overridden, or not, by the individual’s interests, rights or freedoms?

6. Storage of personal data
GRC International Group plc is a UK-domiciled organisation whose primary offices are in the UK.
The majority of our websites and web applications are hosted in the EU and are accessed only by our EU-based staff.
Four of our websites, as identified in section 2 above, are targeted at non-EU customers and are accessed by staff located outside the EU. Our US website is the only one of our websites that is also hosted outside the EU. In all these instances, we have appropriate contractual and security measures in place to ensure that personal data is protected.
Our customer relationship management, marketing and accounting systems for all our businesses are either EU-based or hosted by companies participating in the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework.
We use a wide range of CSPs (Cloud service providers) as part of our processing environment. Unless we specifically state otherwise, we are, in respect of all these CSPs, the data controller.
Unless we specifically state otherwise, all the CSPs that we use utilise EU-located processing facilities.
Our payment processors and banking arrangements are based in the EU and, for our US website, in the US.
We ship and deliver physical products around the world; we therefore use logistics companies that are based outside the EU and operate in other countries. We have appropriate legal and security relationships with those partners.
We resell products supplied by organisations outside the EU. This may mean that our resale partner will have access to information about data subjects who purchase their products.
We operate a data retention policy in respect of all data, whether paper-based or digital, and those aspects of it that relate to personal data are contained in the table at 5, above.
7. Security measures
Our ISMS (information security management system) is certified to ISO/IEC 27001. Our UK business is also Cyber Essentials Plus certified and all our payment card processing is in compliance with the PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard).
We have what we believe are appropriate security controls in place to protect personal data. Risk assessment, including assessing risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, is at the heart of our ISMS. We do not, however, have any control over what happens between your device and the boundary of our information infrastructure. You should be aware of the many information security risks that exist and take appropriate steps to safeguard your own information. We accept no liability in respect of breaches that occur beyond our sphere of control.
8. Your rights as a data subject
As a data subject whose personal information we hold, you have certain rights. If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please email privacy@grci.group or use the information supplied in the Contact us section below. To process your request, we will ask you to provide two valid forms of identification for verification purposes. Your rights are as follows:
The right to be informed
As a data controller, we are obliged to provide clear and transparent information about our data processing activities. This is provided by this privacy policy and any related communications we may send you.
The right of access
You may request a copy of the personal data we hold about you free of charge. Once we have verified your identity and, if relevant, the authority of any third-party requestor, we will provide access to the personal data we hold about you as well as the following information:
a) The purposes of the processing
b) The categories of personal data concerned
c) The recipients to whom the personal data has been disclosed
d) The retention period or envisioned retention period for that personal data
e) When personal data has been collected from a third party, the source of the personal data
If there are exceptional circumstances that mean we can refuse to provide the information, we will explain them. If requests are frivolous or vexatious, we reserve the right to refuse them. If answering requests is likely to require additional time or occasions unreasonable expense (which you may have to meet), we will inform you.
The right to rectification
When you believe we hold inaccurate or incomplete personal information about you, you may exercise your right to correct or complete this data. This may be used with the right to restrict processing to make sure that incorrect/incomplete information is not processed until it is corrected.
The right to erasure (the ‘right to be forgotten’)
Where no overriding legal basis or legitimate reason continues to exist for processing personal data, you may request that we delete the personal data. This includes personal data that may have been unlawfully processed. We will take all reasonable steps to ensure erasure.
The right to restrict processing
You may ask us to stop processing your personal data. We will still hold the data, but will not process it any further. This right is an alternative to the right to erasure. If one of the following conditions applies you may exercise the right to restrict processing:
a) The accuracy of the personal data is contested.
b) Processing of the personal data is unlawful.
c) We no longer need the personal data for processing but the personal data is required for part of a legal process.
d) The right to object has been exercised and processing is restricted pending a decision on the status of the processing.
The right to data portability
You may request your set of personal data be transferred to another controller or processor, provided in a commonly used and machine-readable format. This right is only available if the original processing was on the basis of consent, the processing is by automated means and if the processing is based on the fulfilment of a contractual obligation.
The right to object
You have the right to object to our processing of your data where
Processing is based on legitimate interest;
Processing is for the purpose of direct marketing;
Processing is for the purposes of scientific or historic research; or
Processing involves automated decision-making and profiling.
