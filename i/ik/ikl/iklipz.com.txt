Information for California Users of iklipz
If you are a resident of the State of California, under the California Civil Code, you have the right to request, from companies conducting business in California, a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed Personal Information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that if the company has a Privacy Statement that gives either an opt-out (which we may sometimes refer to as "unsubscribe") or opt-in choice for use of your Personal Information by third parties (such as advertisers or affiliated companies) for marketing purposes, the company may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options. When you "opt-in" it means you are giving and granting us your consent and approval for the transaction, exchange of information, communication or other activity described in the opt-in process or the terms and conditions that apply to your opt-in. You should read our Terms of Use carefully since there are times and situations in which your use of the iklipz Network constitutes your consent and approval (hence your "opt-in"). iklipz qualifies for the alternative option. iklipz has a comprehensive Privacy Statement and provides you with details on how you may either opt-out or opt-in to the use of your Personal Information by third parties for direct marketing purposes. Therefore, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received your Personal Information for marketing purposes during the preceding year.
