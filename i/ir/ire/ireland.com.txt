Information we collect
Simply put, our function is to facilitate your efforts to find an Irish tourism product or service that suits you so the collection of personal information is limited and always voluntary. As a user of our website, you may opt-in to receive information from us, in which case we will require certain personal data from you. This will include your name and email address, and we may also ask for your telephone number so that we can contact you in the event that a problem arises. In all cases, you can be assured that we will only seek the most basic details needed to get the information you requested to you in a timely fashion.
Tourism Ireland does not attempt to collect further data without user consent that enables personally identifiable profiling of our users. We collect and collate generic information on all our site traffic that is only ever represented in aggregate format.
Use of your information by third parties
Tourism Ireland does not sell or pass on your personal details to third parties without your consent, except in the following, highly unlikely, instances:
where it is required by applicable law or pursuant to a court or similar order
where it is required urgently to prevent serious loss or damage to property of Tourism Ireland
where it is required for the purposes of obtaining legal advice or for the purposes of, or in the course of, legal proceedings to which Tourism Ireland is a party or a witness.
From time to time, we conduct joint promotional email campaigns with third parties. As part of such campaigns, if you have ‘opted in’ to receive them, we may forward promotional emails to your email address containing information on products and services that we feel may be of interest to you. Such emails may include links to the websites of third parties, and in this regard we would refer you to the section headed 'Security' below. We will not make your personal information available to any third party and any promotional emails will always be sent by us.
When you enter your contact details on one of our web forms you will have the opportunity to opt out of receiving promotional information from us. This can be done by simply checking the relevant box on the form.
If you decide that you no longer wish to receive promotional information, you can contact us and we will remove you from our mailing list.
Access to the information we hold on you
If you wish to query the information we hold on you or inform us about how we should treat that data or request the deletion of that information, contact us in writing at:

We will not levy any charge in respect of the above actions.
