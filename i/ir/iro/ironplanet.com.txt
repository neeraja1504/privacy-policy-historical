Cookies and Other Technologies
When you interact with our websites or mobile apps, we or our authorized third-party service providers may place cookies, web beacons (also known as action tags or single-pixel gifs), and other non-cookie based technologies on your device to collect and store information that helps us track and analyze usage, provide a more efficient and personalized experience to our users, and to personalize online display advertising tailored to users' interests. This information collected by us may be associated with personal information we already have or collect from other sources for the purposes noted above under "Information Use".
Some of these technologies may be permanently placed on your device until you choose to remove them (i.e. persistent cookies); while others are temporary and are removed after you close your browser (i.e. session cookies). You are always free to block our cookies if your browser or device permits, although doing so may interfere with your use of some of our services' and websites' features or content. For more information on how you can block, delete, or disable cookies, please review your specific browser or device settings. Please review your browser settings for further details. Please also note that you may choose to opt-out of some of these technologies as explained in "Choice/Opt Out" below.
Our use of these technologies falls into four categories:
Operationally necessary - These technologies are used to permit access to our websites or services and use certain features such as maintaining logged-in status for your account while using a website, as well as enabling you to move around it and use its features.
Functionality related - We use these technologies so we can remember your preferences while browsing websites and to provide enhanced and more personalized content and features, such as saved equipment searches. In order to permit your connection and use of our websites and services, we receive and record usage data about your device and browser (see above). If you access the website from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device, geolocation data (where permitted in your device settings), or other transactional information for that device.
Performance related - We and/or our service providers may use analytics and testing technologies to collect information about your usage and interaction with our services and websites, for instance web page views or interaction with a link or other content. We use this information to understand overall usage patterns of our visitors and determine whether certain content is effective or not. We do not permit any of these service providers to use any of your personal information collected on our websites for their own purposes.
Advertising related - These technologies are used by us and our service providers to deliver advertising or personalized emails we believe are relevant to you and your interests. For example, we may use first-party cookies and web beacons to deliver content, including personalized ads, we believe are relevant to your interests, on our websites or on third party sites. This means that when you are on websites other than our websites, you may be shown advertising based on your activity on our websites. These technologies may also be used to help measure the effectiveness of our ad campaigns. These technologies remember what you've looked at on our websites as well as, among other things, IP address, browser type, webpage visited prior to our websites, and the subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over.
Third-party advertisers and other organizations also use their own third-party cookies or plug-ins to collect information about your activities on our websites and/or the advertisements you have clicked on. This information, which may be combined with other information acquired from third parties, may be used by them to serve advertisements on third party sites that they believe are most likely to be of interest to you based on content you have viewed. Third-party advertisers may also use this information to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to track aggregate usage statistics. We do not control these third-parties' processing of your information which is governed by the privacy policies of the third parties employing these cookies. To learn about these cookies and to disable or reject third-party cookies, please refer to the relevant third party's website or "Choice/Opt Out" below.
Security
While we take reasonable administrative, technical and physical measures to protect the information you submit or that we collect online and offline against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure, or modification, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. No Internet, email or mobile application transmission is ever fully secure or error free. If you believe your Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers account has been abused, please contact us at csg@rbauction.com. If you believe your IronPlanet account has been abused, please contact us at customercare@ironplanet.com. To the extent permitted by applicable law, you also agree that we will not be liable for access to or the use or acquisition of your information by any third party without our knowledge or consent in contravention of our safeguards.

We do not attempt to collect personal information from individuals under the age of 18. Note that we cannot always determine if a user of our websites or apps is a child under the age of 18.
Links
Our websites contain links to other sites, including sites maintained by our third party partners for the provision of online payment services and online shipping quotes.

In certain jurisdictions, by doing so, you infer or imply your consent. If you reside in a country that requires that we obtain your express consent separately, we will ask for you to expressly opt-into communications.

If you are receiving marketing emails, you can unsubscribe from these marketing emails by clicking the unsubscribe link in any marketing email you receive.
2. Original Equipment Manufacturers
If you are a bidder and do not want your personal information shared with the original equipment manufacturer ("OEM") of any offered lot and any of the OEM's dealers, representatives and service providers, please contact OEMoptout@rbauction.com.
