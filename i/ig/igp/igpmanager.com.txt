II. SECURITY
We store your personal data in a database hosted within the EEA. It may be processed outside the EEA as may be necessary for the provision of our services and deal with payments. By giving us your personal data you agree to this arrangement. We will do what we reasonably can to keep your data secure.
We will keep your Account data for as long as you are using our services, subject to availability, and will delete the Account with your data 10 years after your last log-in, unless we are required to keep it for legal reasons.
The Site and the Game have security measures in place to prevent the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information that we obtain from you. We store your personal information on secured servers in secured facilities with restricted access, protected by protocols and procedures designed to ensure the security of such information. In addition, we restrict access to personal information to iGP Games employees, independent contractors and agents who need to know this information in order to develop, operate and maintain the Site and the Game. All iGP Games personnel who have access to this information are trained in the maintenance and security of such information.
We use additional security measures to enhance security, such as analysing account behaviour for fraudulent or otherwise anomalous behaviour, may limit use of site features in response to possible signs of abuse, may remove inappropriate content or links to illegal content, and may suspend or disable accounts for violations of our Terms of Service.
Although we allow you to set privacy options that limit access to your information, please be aware that no server, computer or communications network or system, or data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect user information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us through the use of the Game or the Site and we make no assurances about our ability to prevent any such loss or misuse to you or to any third-party. You acknowledge and agree that you provide such information and engage in such transmissions at your own risk. You can reduce these risks by using common sense security practices such as choosing a strong password, using different passwords for different services, and using up to date antivirus software.
Should you have any concern or knowledge of security violations please report them to the Support Team.
