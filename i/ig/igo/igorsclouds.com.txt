This Privacy Statement is a formal document that outlines the information which may be collected about you while you use IgorsClouds, and how that information may be used. This Statement will also instruct you on what to do if you do not want your personal information collected or shared when you visit the IgorsClouds website.
Personal Identifying Information:
IgorsClouds will not collect any personal identifying information about you (including, but not limited to, your name, address, telephone number, email address, Social Security number, bank account or credit card information, or any combination of data that could be used to identify you, such as birth date, zip code, and gender) unless you provide it to us voluntarily. If you do not want your personal identifying information collected, please do not submit it to us. If you have already submitted this information and would like for us to remove it from our records, please contact us at the email address listed at the bottom of this Statement. We will use reasonable efforts to delete your information from our existing files. When you do provide us with personal identifying information, such information will be gathered solely by IgorsClouds, and is for use solely by IgorsClouds and trusted partners. At any point where personal identifying information is requested, any information that is optional to provide (rather than mandatory) will be clearly indicated as such. We may use personal identifying information in the following ways, unless stated otherwise: we may store and process that information to better understand your needs and how we can improve our products and services; and we may use that information to contact you. Financial information that is collected is used to check the users' qualifications for registration, and to bill the user for products and services. IgorsClouds may utilize electronic newsletters to reach all, or a subset of all registered users, using the email address collected. Users may remove themselves from such mailing lists at any time by following the instructions that are included as part of any of such mailings. IgorsClouds may request personal identifying information on specific pages that allow users to contact IgorsClouds. Such information is being collected to assist us in solving a specific issue addressed by the user and/or to allow us to contact the user with an appropriate response. There are a limited number of situations where we may disclose your personal information to others without first obtaining your consent: (1) when legally ordered to do so by a lawful subpoena or court order, (2) if you violate or breach an agreement with us, (3) if we believe conduct by you will harm the property or rights of IgorsClouds or those of IgorsClouds customers or chat hosts, (4) under exigent circumstances to protect the physical safety of IgorsClouds, its employees, users, or the general public, (5) in connection with the sale of all or substantially all of our company's assets, or the sale of an entire web site or business division, or (6) in order to validate credit card numbers for charging for fee services.

Minors:
Because we care about the safety and privacy of children online, we comply with the Children's Online Privacy Act of 1998 (COPA). COPA and its accompanying FTC regulation established a United States federal law that protects the privacy of children using the Internet. IgorsClouds does not knowingly collect contact or personal information from persons under the age of 18. Our sites are not intended to solicit information of any kind from persons under the age of 18, and we have designed our sites to block our knowing acceptance of information from persons under the age of 18 wherever age-related information is requested.
The members areas of IgorsClouds may contain content considered offensive to some, and are inaccessible to individuals under the age of 18 via a standard credit card wall as advocated by the Communications Decency Act. It is possible that, by fraud or deception, we may receive information given to us or pertaining to minors under the age of 18. If we are notified of this, as soon as we verify the information, we will immediately obtain parental consent or otherwise delete the information from our servers. If you want to notify us of our receipt of information by minors, please do so by emailing us at support@IgorsClouds.com.

Some trusted partners may email a member to present special offers to our members. Further, according to our published policy, if IgorsClouds becomes aware that a customer or affiliate is in violation of the law or this Acceptable Use Policy, IgorsClouds reserves the right to impose disciplinary action at its sole discretion. Our disciplinary action may include but is not limited to: removal from our servers of files that violate our Acceptable Use Policy, the expulsion of the customer from the IgorsClouds program, termination of IgorsClouds services, and forfeiture of all commissions.
