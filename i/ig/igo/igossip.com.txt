2. INFORMATION COLLECTION PRACTICES.
2.1. WHAT BASIC INFORMATION DOES IGOSSIP COLLECT?
The operation of the Site may include registration, online surveys, and other online forms that ask Users to provide their names street address, town or city, state, zip code, telephone number, instant-messenger nickname, blog or other personal website URL, date of birth, e-mail address and any other information that would allow someone to identify you or contact you. Personal Information also includes information about your personal preferences, survey responses and your transactions or relationship with us. In addition to your name and contact information, we will also collect and maintain information about your computer's internet address and website which may have referred or directed you to the Site (e.g., the referring URL).
2.2. User Profile Information. iGossip collects user submitted information such as name, email address, and age to authenticate Users and to send notifications to those Users relating to iGossip Service. iGossip also collects other profile data including but not limited to: personal interests, profile pictures, gender, age, and geographical location in order to assist Users in finding and communicating with each other.
iGossip also logs non-personally-identifiable information including IP address, profile information, aggregate user data, cookie information, and browser type, from Users and visitors to the site. This data is used to manage the Site, track usage and improve the Site Services. This non-personally-identifiable information may be shared with third-parties to provide more relevant services and advertisements to Users. User IP addresses are recorded for security and monitoring purposes.
User Profile information including Users' pictures, User Names, and first names are displayed to people in order to facilitate user interaction in the iGossip social networking community. Users can change their profile information at any time and can control how other Users and the Service communicates with them. However, once you select a User Name you will not be able to change that User Name provided to us during registration and which is associated with your User Name. Among other things, these kinds of information help us securely identify you as a registered or permitted user of the Site and our features and functions. Additionally you will not be able to change your date of birth without sufficient verification.
Email addresses are used for the purposes of inviting new friends to join iGossip, to add Users to Users' contacts networks, and to send notifications related to the service. With the exception of inviting friends, adding friends, and notifications, a User's email address is not shared or displayed to people within a User's personal network. Users within a personal network communicate on iGossip with each other through the iGossip Service, without disclosing their email addresses. Users' full names are never directly revealed to other Users. We may also use a User's email address to send updates, a newsletter, or news regarding the service, though Users may choose not to receive email of this type. You may select such options by opting-in at the time of registration or by responding to an offer or invitation at a later date. You will also have the right to opt-out (unsubscribe) or change your preferences at any time by logging in with your User Name and changing the settings in your account. You may also opt- out to particular email communications by responding to that email and using the "unsubscribe" or opt-out procedure included in that communication.
From time to time, iGossip or a partner may sponsor a promotion, sweepstake or contest on iGossip. Users may be asked to provide personal information including name, email address or home address or to answer questions in order to participate. We may transfer personal information to certain ad partners that you have explicitly requested to receive information from. It will be clear at the point of collection who is collecting the personal information and whose privacy statement will apply.
2.3 Invitations and Other Communications to Non-Users
iGossip Users can invite friends to join the service by sending invitation emails via our automated invitation system. iGossip stores the email addresses that Users provide so that the respondents may be added to the friend's list of the User sending the invitations, and also to send reminders of the invitations. iGossip does not sell these email addresses or use them to send any other communication besides invitations, invitation reminders (up to three (3) per email address). Recipients of invitations from iGossip may contact iGossip to request the removal of their information from our database.
You may prevent iGossip email invitations and other messages from being sent to any email address you control by sending a single email with the subject "BLOCK INVITE" to support@igossip.com. Please note that the email must come from the account you wish to block.

We may also use your contact information to inform you of any changes to the Site, or to send you additional information about iGossip. If you give your permission during the account registration process, we may share your contact information with our business partners or other companies so that they may send you promotional materials.
(b) ANONYMOUS INFORMATION. We use anonymous information to analyze our Site traffic, but we do not examine this information for individually identifying information. In addition, we may use anonymous IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our site, or to display the content according to your preferences. Traffic and transaction information may also be shared with business partners and advertisers on an aggregate and anonymous basis.
(c) USE OF COOKIES. We may use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests, to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site, or for other purposes. Promotions or advertisements displayed on our site may contain cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad servers may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on. This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by iGossip and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. We do not have access to or control over information collected by outside advertisers on our site.
(d) DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION. We may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (1) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on iGossip or its Parent Company, (2) protect and defend the rights or property of iGossip, its Parent Company, or the Users of the Site, or (3) act under exigent circumstances to protect the safety of the public or Users of the Site.
(e) SALE OF INFORMATION. We do not rent, sell, or share Personally Identifiable Information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:
1. Advertising and marketing agencies to help sell and market products, services and software of ours and our marketing partners;
2. Technology and other service providers to provide technology and services to us and to you;
3. Vendors that help us with data analysis, for example for product efficacy studies and market analysis;
4. We display targeted advertisements based on personal information. Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click on targeted ads meet the targeting criteria; but We do not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad. In order to accommodate changes in our business, we may sell or buy portions of our company or other companies or assets, including the information collected through the Site. The Parent Company or substantially all of its assets are acquired; User information will be one of the assets transferred to the acquirer. In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors' rights generally, we may not be able to control how your personal information is treated, transferred, or used.
(f) ACCESS TO INFORMATION.

4. SECURITY
The Site has security measures in place to prevent the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information that we obtain from you, but we make no assurances about our ability to prevent any such loss, misuse, to you or to any third party arising out of any such loss, misuse, or alteration. iGossip User accounts are secured by User-created passwords. iGossip takes precautions to insure that User account information is kept private. We use reasonable measures to protect User information that is stored within our database, and we restrict access to User information to those employees who need access to perform their job functions, such as our customer service personnel and technical staff. Please note that we cannot guarantee the security of User account information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of User information at any time.
4.1 Phishing
We do not and will not, at any time, request Personally Identifiable Information or other information in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication. Phishing attacks attempt to steal consumers' personal identity data and financial account credentials. "Phishers" use 'spoofed' e-mails to lead consumers to counterfeit websites designed to trick recipients into divulging Personal Information such as credit card numbers, account u_titles, passwords, and social security numbers. WE DO NOT SEND EMAILS ASKING YOU TO PROVIDE OR CONFIRM SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION OR YOUR u_title OR PASSWORD! If you receive such email communication, please forward it immediately to the Site's Privacy Administrator, and then immediately delete the fraudulent email from your computer. Identity theft and the practice currently known as phishing are of great concern to us. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is one of our priorities. For more information about phishing, visit the Federal Trade Commission at http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/alerts/phishingalrt.htm.
