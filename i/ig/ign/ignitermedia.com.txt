Privacy - Igniter Media
Igniter Media (IM) is committed to maintaining your trust and confidence. The following online privacy policy is intended to protect and secure the personally identifiable information (any information by which you can be identified) you provide to our organization online.
Awareness
IM provides this online privacy policy to inform you of the way your information is collected and used as well as to make you aware of our security practices. We also provide you with the opportunity to remove your name from our postal mailing list, if you desire to do so.
Information We Collect
There are two different ways in which we collect information from visitors on our Web site:
From online requests for information (i.e. e-mail newsletters, contact forms, etc.);
From online requests for materials from our organization (i.e. requesting a free offer)
The information we collect online includes name, address, city, state, ZIP/postal code, telephone number, e-mail address, and, in the case of online shopping, credit card number and expiration date. In order to continuously improve our service to you and tailor our future communications to you, we may also ask you to provide us with information regarding your demographics, comments, professional interests, and contact preferences.
How the Information Is Used
IM uses your information to understand your needs and provide you with better online service. We may use your information to complete a transaction, to update you on our projects and videos, or to personalize our Web site for you. Credit card numbers are used only for payment processing and are not retained for any other purposes. We also provide you the opportunity to remove your name from our postal mailing list, if you desire to do so. Please review the corresponding section of this privacy policy below.
In addition, IM will not send you e-mail that you have not agreed to receive. We may periodically send you e-mail announcing news and event information. If you choose to supply your postal address in an online form, you may receive mailings from us as well.
Sharing of Personal Information
IM never sells, rents, leases or exchanges your personal information with other organizations. IM assures you that the identity of all who contact us through this Web site will be kept confidential. IM may occasionally send mailings on behalf of other organizations or ministries when their interests align with IM. Use of your personal information will be limited to further the ministry activities of IM and partner ministries.
Security
IM is committed to ensuring the security of your personal information. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the proper use of information, we have established and implemented appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. IM uses Internet Encryption Software, Secure Socket Layer (SSL) Protocol when collecting or transferring sensitive data such as credit card information. Any information you enter is encrypted at your browser, sent over the public Internet in encrypted form, and then de-encrypted at our server. Once we receive your credit card information, it is accessible only to a small number of trusted IM employees who have been specially trained in processing this information.
