Cookies and other technologies
To help analyze how you and other visitors navigate the iGEM websites, help diagnose any problems with iGEM’s servers, we, with assistance from third-party analytics service providers, collect certain information when you visit our site. This information includes IP address, geographic location of the device, browser type, browser language, date and time of your request, time(s) of your visit(s), page views and page elements (e.g., links) that you click. We may use cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, clear GIFs or other similar tools on our websites or in our email messages to assist us in collecting and analyzing such information. We use this information to provide better, more relevant content on our site, to identify and fix problems, and to improve your overall experience on our websites.
If you do not want information collected through the use of these technologies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline many of these technologies, or to be given the choice of declining or accepting them. If you reside in the European Union or other jurisdiction that requires us to obtain your consent to use cookies on our sites, then you will have an opportunity to manage your cookie preferences on the sites; except that certain cookies are required to enable core site functionality, and you cannot choose to disable those cookies.
In many of our email messages including iGEM newsletters and announcements, we use a “click-through URL” linked to content on the iGEM websites. When you click one of these URLs, you will pass through a separate web server before arriving at the destination page on our website. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our emailed communications. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic links in the email messages. Pixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read, and they tell us whether mail has been opened.
Email and Other Communications
We may use your personal information to send important notices, such as communications about updates for iGEM events you have registered for and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. We will do this via the email address you provide when you register an iGEM user account. Because this information is important to your interaction with iGEM, you may not opt out of receiving these communications.
We will also want to contact you about iGEM programs, general competition announcements, website updates, and special offers from our sponsors.
