Privacy Policy
Thanks for visiting igamemom.com.  The privacy of our visitors is important to us.  This privacy policy tells you how we collect and use personal information at this site. By using this site, you are accepting the practices described in this privacy policy.
Collection of Information
We collect personally identifiable information, like names and email addresses when voluntarily submitted by our visitors. We will collect personal information by lawful and fair means and, where appropriate, with the knowledge or consent of the individual concerned. Before or at the time of collecting personal information, we will identify the purposes for which information is being collected. We will collect and use personal information solely with the objective of fulfilling those purposes specified by us and for other compatible purposes, unless we obtain the consent of the individual concerned or as required by law.
Cookie/Tracking Technology
A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. Cookies may be either “persistent” cookies or “session” cookies: a persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed. Cookies do not typically contain any information that personally identifies a user, but personal information that we store about you may be linked to the information stored in and obtained from cookies.
By using this Site, you consent to the use of such cookies and the sharing of data captured by such cookies with AdThrive, Google, and our other third party partners. You can view, delete or add interest categories associated with your browser by visiting: https://adssettings.google.com. You can also opt out of the network cookie using those settings or using the Network Advertising Initiative’s multi-cookie opt-out mechanism at: http://optout.networkadvertising.org. However, these opt-out mechanisms themselves use cookies, and if you clear the cookies from your browser your opt-out will not be maintained.
We may use third party advertisements, such as Google AdSense, to support our site.  Some of these advertisers may use cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site.  This information allows them to deliver targeted advertisements and measure their effectiveness. Our website does not provide any personal information to these third parties. You can choose to disable or selectively turn off cookies in your browser settings if you prefer.
