This same information may be shared with third parties in order to provide these services or to analyze, store, or aggregate the information. It may also be shared with other third parties, working with us to improve our services or this website.
When and With Whom We Share Your Personal Information
We never sell or rent your personal information to any third parties under any circumstances. We will share personal customer information and/or purchase history only with our agents, representatives, service providers and contractors for limited purposes, including but not limited to: fulfilling customer orders; offering certain products and services in connection with this site; communicating to clients; providing customer service; enhancing and improving client online experiences; administering or facilitating surveys, contests or sweepstakes; offering targeted marketing communications to users that opted-in to receive such communications; enabling access to our partners' Web sites; providing a personalized online experience; preventing fraud; and completing payment method processing.
Aside from the purposes described above, we will never share your personal information with any other third parties unless we have your express permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the disclosure is required to prevent harm or injury (such as product recalls, fraud, claims or other liability), or to comply with valid legal processes (subpoenas, warrants) as required by law.

Links
This site contains links to other sites. These links are provided for your convenience and are not intended as an endorsement by ie-business of the entities operating these sites nor as a warranty of the information the sites contain. Infusion e-business is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these other Web sites, and urges users to review the privacy policies of the individual sites. Visitors always can accept or reject any cookies from our Web sites by taking advantage of the related settings and tools on their own computers.
Security
The SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is the most powerful encryption available on the Internet. This means that any information related to credit cards is encrypted when being sent to us, so no one else is able to read it.
Having a secure server takes the risk out of credit card transactions. We also do all order processing on software that is separate from the Internet, so there is no danger of anyone gaining access to your order information. We do NOT keep credit card information on file. While we realize this reducing future ordering convenience, we feel that the safest way to protect credit card information is not to store it, but request it each time a purchase is made.
Please note: that email is not encrypted and not considered a secure way to transmit credit card information.
Children
Users of all ages are welcome to visit ie-business.com and view its contents. However, supervision of children's activities on the Internet is the responsibility of parents or legal guardians to ensure that children do not release personal and/or purchasing information online without permission.
We do not solicit or collect personal information from anyone under the age of 18. If you are under the age of 18, you must not provide your name, email address, or any other identifying information without the consent of your parent or legal guardian, or as otherwise provided for by applicable law.
Voluntary Use of Contact Forms
Infusion e-business forms may request that visitors voluntarily provide personal information, including name, company/organization, city and state of residence, and telephone numbers. The contact information is only used to contact the visitor as requested. Infusion e-business does NOT distribute to third parties any information provided on infusion e-business forms. Infusion e-business will not disclose an individual's/employee's identifying information provided by voluntary use of a Contact Form, or specific use of the system to any individual, employer, or organization under any circumstances.
