One of the purposes of the IEC collecting personal information is to provide you with the best possible service.
Personal Information
We may collect information about you when you use this Website, or when you apply for or use other services offered by the IEC, in the following ways:
As you browse through the IEC Website, we may automatically gather and store information about your visit via cookies. We may use session-specific cookies to collect data automatically about Website use when you visit this site, including e.g. your IP address, domain name, Internet service provider, protocol, browser type and operating system. This information is notably required when you use the IEC’s Webstore to purchase IEC publications.
When you use our Webstore to purchase IEC publications, or subscribe to our online magazines (iec e-tech or Just Published), or subscribe to MyNewDocs, or request specific information or products, we will use the personal data that you provide only for such purposes as are described at the point of collection and at the time of data input, such as to send you information or ordered products, to update your membership record or to respond to your questions and comments.
The IEC will use such personally identifying data as (without restriction) full name, address, e-mail, phone and fax numbers only for business purposes within the IEC, which includes communication of the data to the IEC member National Committees. If you are a person who has been nominated to participate in IEC work, your National Committee has access to your record and can modify it in accordance with your legal rights. This data may also be made available to the officers of the committee, project team, working group or maintenance team to permit them to contact you.
Membership lists of committees and subgroups are available publicly on the IEC Website. These lists include only the name and country of each participant. No means of contact information (notably e-mail, address and phone/ fax number) are given.
Surveys
From time to time, we may ask our site visitors to answer survey questions. Surveys generally deal with the site, our products or categories of products. They will not request any personal data.
Referrals
Some areas of the IEC Website may provide you with the opportunity to e-mail a Web page to another person. For this feature to work, we may need to collect your e-mail address and/or the e-mail addresses of those to whom you send the page. The e-mail addresses collected in this context are not used for any purpose other than to send the Web page in question.

Responsibility for information and services of linked sites rests entirely with the relevant third parties. No liability can be accepted in respect of the content of such Websites.
Data Protection and Accessing, Deleting or Correcting of Data
Based on Article 13 of the Federal Constitution and the provisions of the Swiss data protection legislation, everyone has the right to the protection of privacy, as well as to protection from misuse of their personal details. The IEC complies with these provisions. Personal details are treated in the highest confidence and are neither passed on, shared nor sold to third parties (whether situated in a country providing standards of protection similar to those of Switzerland or not) except in the following case:
The IEC may disclose personal data to third parties (whether situated in a country providing standards of protection similar to those of Switzerland or not) if the IEC is required to do so by law or if such action is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process, to respond to any claims, or to protect the rights of the IEC, its customers and the public. For the purposes of this clause, National Committees of the IEC, even when situated outside Switzerland, are not deemed to be third parties and you hereby consent to the transfer of personal data to such National Committees for the purpose of managing your participation in IEC work.
You can consult, revise and correct the personal data that you have provided to the IEC Webstore via http://webstore.iec.ch. To revise or correct personal data relating to your participation in IEC work, you should contact your National Committee. If you wish to correct data relating to your position or function in an IEC committee (for example, National Committee official, TC/SC secretary, chairman, PT leader or WG/MT convenor), you should contact the IEC Central Office.
We will retain your personal information in accordance with applicable data protection laws for so long as it is needed in the light of the principle of proportionality.
