We promise to never store any of your personal information, ever. Our reputation is very important to us and we intend to earn and keep our solid reputation through demonstrated transparency, integrity, and consistency. The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to explain the collection, use, and disclosure of ‚Äúpersonal information‚Äù by iEmoji.com. This Privacy Policy also explains our commitment to you with respect to our use and disclosure of non-personal browsing and site usage data that iEmoji.com collects. By accessing and using iEmoji.com, you are accepting and agreeing to the practices in this Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to any of the websites operated by affiliates of iEmoji.com or any links to non-affiliated websites that may be provided through the Twitter.com tweets that we display.
Personal Information
Personal information means information that would allow a party to identify you such as, for example, your name, address or location, telephone number or email address. Generally, we do not ask for or collect personal information through iEmoji.com. However, part of our service is to provide access to and display public tweets made through Twitter.com. These public tweets are displayed the same as they are on Twitter.com and include the Twitter user name, a profile picture, and the information in the tweet itself.
Our website also allows connection to Twitter. We save Twitter user ID numbers when a Twitter user logs into the site. We also save the Twitter screen name, name, the status text and metadata about the status that people post from iEmoji.com in order to properly display the tweet. We save Twitter ID numbers to address technical problems that can arise and monitor abuse of our website.
We may also collect personal information when people send us an email or any other form of communication.
Disclosing of Personal Information
In general, it is not iEmoji.com‚Äôs practice to disclose personal information to third parties without our consent. In addition, we store very limited non-public personal information and thus have very little if any personal information to disclose. That said, we may share personal information in two instances:
First, iEmoji.com may share personal information with our contractors and service providers in order to maintain, enhance, or add to the functionality of the Websites or services.
Second, we may disclose your personal information to third parties in a good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) take action regarding suspected illegal activities; (b) enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions of Use and Privacy Policy; (c) comply with legal process, such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order; or (d) protect our rights, reputation, and property, or that of our users, affiliates, or the public.
Data Usage Policy: Non Personal Browsing and Site Usage Information
Our Data Usage Policy covers how we maintain and use information about you that is collected by iEmoji.com and server logs.
Non Personal Browsing Information We Collect. When you use iEomji.com, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) may collect information indirectly and automatically (through, for example, the use of your ‚ÄúIP address‚Äù) about your activities while visiting iEmoji.com and information about the browser you are using.
No Linking. We do not intentionally link browsing information or server logs to the personal information you submit to us. We use this information for internal purposes only, such as to help understand how iEomji.com is being used, to improve iEomji.com and the features we provide, and for systems administration purposes. We may use a third party analytics provider to help us collect and analyze non personal browsing information through operation of iEomji.com for those same purposes. For opt-out options view the Google Analytics currently available opt-outs for the web.
