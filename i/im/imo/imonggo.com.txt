Store Product, Sales and Inventory Transaction Data The contents of your Imonggo.com account are stored and maintained on Imonggo.com servers in order to provide the service. Because we keep backup copies of data for the purposes of recovery from errors or system failure, residual copies of your store data may remain on our systems for some time, even after you have deleted information or after the termination of your account. Imonggo.com employees do not access the content of any task lists unless you specifically request them to do so (normally for technical support reasons) or if required by law, to maintain our system, or to protect Imonggo.com or the public.

Credit Card Information
In general, sensitive data on the credit card such as credit card numbers and card verification codes are never stored on our server. Only the last 4 digits of the credit card number are kept for reference.
In the premium edition, we can use Imonggo to process your customers’ credit card payments. When you enable this feature, we automatically enable the SSL feature as well. This means that we use industry standard 128-bit SSL (Secure Socket Layer) software to encrypt all of the data sent to us so that only your web browser and the Imonggo server can decipher them. Likewise, sensitive data such as credit card numbers and card verification codes of your customers’ credit cards are never kept on the server, so there is no chance of them being misappropriated.
