Website Security Policy
Website Security Policy for Clients
iModules Software treats the security of its client’s data with utmost importance. We take many precautions at the infrastructure and software layers to deliver the highest level of protection for your constituent data and sensitive information. iModules owns and operates the database and web servers that host clients' websites and store their data. These servers are protected by securely configured firewalls that prevent data from being accessed via the Internet. Each client's data is stored in a dedicated database; this prevents the intrusion or corruption of data. In addition, clients' data catalogs cannot see or access each other's data.
SSL
Login, electronic commerce, and administrative activity is transmitted over an industry standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL).
Logins and Passwords
Strong passwords are required for each login, and they are stored in a salted, hashed format that cannot be read by administrators or employees. Multiple failed logins or lost login requests are challenged by reCaptcha. An administrative rights system restricts authenticated but unauthorized access to constituent data.
Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
The collection, storage, or display of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in iModules’ Application Services or use of iModules’ Web Services is prohibited. For example, (i) PII items relating to: Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA); (ii) Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA); or (iii) government issued identifications, including, but not limited to, Social Security Numbers, Driver License Numbers, and Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers.

All date of birth data values are stored encrypted. Please note we do not allow clients to store any PII relating to Social Security Numbers, Driver License Numbers, or any other government issued identification.
PCI Compliance
iModules maintains compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) and is certified compliant as a Level One Service Provider by a Qualified Security Assessor (QSA) authorized by the PCI Security Standards Council. iModules' processes, procedures, network configuration, and overall environment conform to all of the security guidelines as defined in the PCI DSS standard and are annually verified by an external auditor. This Level One compliance, the highest level of PCI DSS compliance, helps ensure your e-commerce transaction data is securely protected, transmitted, and stored by iModules. As part of iModules policy, datacenters hosting the Encompass platform must maintain their own annual SSAE 16 audit. Upon request, iModules shall provide the current attestation of compliance for PCI DSS as well as provide a certified SSAE 16, or equivalent review, performed and completed by an external audit firm, on behalf of the datacenter used for iModules Encompass platform.
