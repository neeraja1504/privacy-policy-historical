When you sign up for an account with ImgDream, we collect personal information from you including your email address and a password.
We may also collect the URL from which you linked into our site, your IP address, and your browser type and version. All of which are collected in an anonymous manner without being linked to any of your personal information.
User privacy is something we take very seriously at ImgDream. We do not, and have never, sold or disseminated (except in cases where required to by law enforcement agencies) the personal information of our users to any parties outside of ImgDream. We use account information for the purposes of creating and maintaining individual user accounts, contacting a user in case of a problem with their account, for statistical purposes, to administer our systems, to conduct surveys, to administer drawings or contests, and to provide technical support. All of our development is done in-house, and hence no contracted parties will ever have access to individual account information.
If you have any question, please do not hesitate to contact us.
