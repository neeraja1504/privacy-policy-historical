Privacy Policy
Information Collected and Stored Automatically:
When you visit our website to read pages or download information, we automatically collect and store the following information:
The Internet protocol or IP address that you access our site from. An IP address is a unique number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using whenever you surf the web.
The type of browser (Netscape, Internet Explorer, etc.) and the operating system (Windows 7, Linux, etc.) that you use to access our site.
The date and time that you accessed our site, so that we can see how much demand there is for the site.
The pages that you visited, so that we can improve our site by giving you helpful links and taking away pages that are never visited.
The information that we collect doesn't identify you personally. We keep it on our system logs and only use it to make the site more useful by learning the number of visitors who use the site, the number of pages provided and how much demand there is for specific pages. We do not check or record any information about the identities of our visitors.
Information Collected from E-mail:
When you send us personally-identifying information by e-mail, we only use that information to help us with your request. In order to respond to your request quickly and efficiently, that information might be viewed by a number of people within Imaginet. Once we have responded to your request, the information is protected by law (e.g. the Privacy Act and the Freedom of Information Act).
Security, Intrusion, and Detection:
For the purpose of site security and to make sure that the service is always available to all users, our computer system uses software programs that watch network traffic and point out unauthorised attempts to upload or change information, or to cause damage in any other way.
Privacy Policy for Subscribers:
If you subscribe to our services, you will need to give us personally-identifiable information that will give you access to our services. This information will be entered into our database, but we do not make it available to anyone outside of the company unless required to do so by law.
