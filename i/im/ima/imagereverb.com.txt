The Way ImageReverb Retains Information
To preserve the integrity of website databases ImageReverb's procedure is to retain information submitted by members for an indefinite length of time. By submitting information to ImageReverb you are consenting to store that information indefinitely.
If required by law, such as the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA,) ImageReverb will scramble and/or encrypt that information to make it unrecognizable. ImageReverb will also respond to written member requests to scramble account information.
The Way ImageReverb Uses Information
If you submit personally identifiable information to us through the ImageReverb Sites, then we use your personal information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the ImageReverb Sites.
Any personal information or video content that you voluntarily disclose online (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, within your public profile page, etc.) becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by others. Your account name (not your email address) is displayed to other Users when you upload videos or send messages through the ImageReverb Sites and other Users can contact you through messages and comments. Any videos that you submit to the ImageReverb Sites may be redistributed through the internet and other media channels, and may be viewed by the general public.
We do not use your email address or other personally identifiable information to send commercial or marketing messages without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may, however, use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major ImageReverb Site changes or for customer service purposes).
We use both your personally identifiable information and certain non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of the ImageReverb Sites and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing User preferences and trends.
We use cookies and log file information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the ImageReverb Sites; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.; and (e) track your entries, submissions, and status in promotions, sweepstakes, and contests.
When ImageReverb Discloses Information
We provide personally identifiable information and non-personally-identifiable information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or other businesses or persons for the purpose of processing such information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information in compliance with our privacy policy, and we use reasonable efforts to limit their use of such information and to use other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
We do not share your personally identifiable information (such as name or email address) with other, third-party companies for their commercial or marketing use without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out.
We do share non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third-parties to assist them in understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on the ImageReverb Sites.
We may release personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information if required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws or respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant.
ImageReverb also reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information that ImageReverb believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our Terms of Use, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend itself against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of our web site, and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of ImageReverb, our Users or others.

Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites
ImageReverb allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the ImageReverb Sites. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the ImageReverb Sites. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content.
ImageReverb does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. However, please note that if an advertiser asks ImageReverb to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 18-24 who have viewed certain channels of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach.
You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks. ImageReverb's privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites.
Currently, ImageReverb has relationships with the following third-party ad servers or ad networks:

Our Commitment To Data Security:
ImageReverb uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to ImageReverb and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, ImageReverb makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.
If ImageReverb learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. ImageReverb may post a notice on the ImageReverb Sites if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice) you should notify customer service.
Our Commitment to Legal-Age Usage
Protecting children from adult content is especially important. For that reason, ImageReverb does not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information or non-personally-identifiable information on the ImageReverb Sites from persons under 18 years of age, and no part of our website is directed to persons under 18, or legal age according to state law. If you are under 18 years of age, then please do not use or access the ImageReverb Sites at any time or in any manner. If ImageReverb learns that personally identifiable information of persons under 18 years of age has been collected on the ImageReverb Sites then ImageReverb will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.

In the Event of Merger, Sale, or Bankruptcy
In the event that ImageReverb is acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information we have collected from our Users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors' rights generally, we may not be able to control how your personal information is treated, transferred, or used.
