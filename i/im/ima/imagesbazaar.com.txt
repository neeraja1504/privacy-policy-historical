Privacy Policy
Privacy Policy
The online Registration Form asks visitors for demographic information (like their PIN code or Telephone No.) . Demographic and profile data is also collected at the site. We use this data to tailor our visitor's experience and services at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences.
The customer's contact information is used to contact the visitor when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. We do not divulge the visitor's information to any third party for commercial use. We may use the data for informing the users of our services and offerings from time to time.
What information do you collect when I register for something?
IMAGESBAZAAR offers access to some services that require registration. We may use your contact information to send notification to you of IMAGESBAZAAR products and services by e-mail and/or postal mail. We also may share that information with our clients. Our clients may send you promotional material that is related to the topic of the service for which you registered. We may also use your IP address internally and share it with third parties.
What other information do you request?
We may also request your e-mail address or mailing address for the purpose of conducting a survey or to provide additional services (for example, subscriptions to e-mail newsletters, announcement lists or information about conferences and trade shows). Whenever we request the identity of a visitor, we will clearly indicate the purpose of the inquiry before the information is requested. We maintain a strict "No-Spam" policy that means that we do not sell, rent, or otherwise give your e-mail address to a third-party, without your consent or as permitted by this Privacy Policy.
We may from time to time send e-mail announcing new IMAGESBAZAAR products and services. If you choose to supply your postal address in an online form, you may receive postal mailings from other third party companies.
What information do you collect when I purchase something?
If you are purchasing something from an IMAGESBAZAAR media property, we and any third party provider, need to know your name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card number and expiration date. This allows us, or third party providers, to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order status. This information may also be used by us to notify you of related products and services. Credit card and e-mail information will not be shared or sold to third parties for any purpose except as provided in this Privacy Policy without your express permission.
Wherever IMAGESBAZAAR collects personal information we make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy on that page.
Will you disclose the information you collect to outside third parties?
IMAGESBAZAAR will disclose personal information and/or an IP address, when required by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to :
