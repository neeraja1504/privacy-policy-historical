When we do, we will ensure that an adequate level of protection is provided for the information by using one or more of the following approaches:
Data subject rights
Under data protection laws, you have various rights, such as the right of access, that gives you the right to ask us for copies of any of your personal information that is in our possession; the right to rectification that allows you to rectify and complete information that you think is inaccurate or incomplete; and the right to erasure that gives you the right to ask us to erase your personal information in certain circumstances. You also have the right to restriction of processing, to object to processing and to data portability.
These rights available to you may depend on our reason for processing your information and the circumstances. You are not required to pay any charge for exercising your rights, unless your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. We will respond to any legitimate requests within one month. In the event that your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive or if we are not in a position to identify you, we are entitled to refuse to act on your request.
Security of your personal information
To help protect the privacy of personal information you transmit to us, we maintain physical, technical and administrative safeguards. We update and test our security technology on an ongoing basis. We restrict access to your personal information to those employees who need to know that personal information to provide benefits or services to you. In addition, we train our employees about the importance of confidentiality and maintaining the privacy and security of your personal information. We commit to taking appropriate disciplinary measures to enforce our employees’ privacy responsibilities.

If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for the services or send any personal information about yourself to us.

If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us personal information, please contact us at privacy@imanage.com.

If we make significant changes to this Privacy Policy that materially alter our privacy practices, we may also notify you by other means, such as sending an email or posting a notice on our corporate website and/or social media pages prior to the changes taking effect. Your continued use of our websites or services after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes, so please check this Privacy Policy periodically for updates.
