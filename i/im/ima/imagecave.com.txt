Privacy Statement
Information obtained by ImageCave.com during the signup process, including usernames, passwords, and email addresses, will not be sold or otherwise used for any outside organizations for promotional or any other purposes.
As a policy, ImageCave.com will never support or add to the problem of SPAM on the Internet - we find the abuse of email systems by spammers to be offensive, and the legal system is finally responding by initiating laws to help reduce SPAM.
From time to time, as a courtesy, we may send photo hosting service or system updates to our registered users, or announcements regarding other ImageCave.com services, but any email address or other information collected will be maintained and kept private by ImageCave.com.
For privacy information obtained from any and all partners that provide sponsorship or member offers, please visit their respective websites.
