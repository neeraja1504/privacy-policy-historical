Our privacy policy is simple - we do not sell or give your personal information to anyone at any time, ever!
If You Order
Our site uses an order form for customers to order our products. We collect contact information (like email addresses), and financial information (like account or credit card numbers). Contact information from the order form is used to ship orders. Telephone numbers are optional but can be useful for contacting you if there is a problem with your order.

You will receive a confirmation email immediately after you order. In a second email you will receive the activation key. Your email address is not used for any other purpose. To receive notifications of future updates, you need to subscribe to our newsletter.
