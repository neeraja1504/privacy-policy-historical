Our Commitment to Your Privacy
We are committed to helping you, our Imikimi customer to
share your positive contributions
express yourself creatively
discover and deepen your connection with others
easily and fully control your privacy
We charge you a small fee to make it possible to do those things. We do not sell or share your data with 3rd parties. That makes your privacy and your control over your digital social life SO much easier!
You pay us to work for you, our customer.
Other, ad-supported sites get paid by 3rd parties you don’t even know, to package up all of the data of your digital life, for purposes you have little control over. You are not their customer, you are their product.
Note: We do work with 3rd party services, but we do so solely for the purpose of serving you. These services include, but are not limited to: data storage, servers, analytics, and contacting you.
You Control Your Privacy
We invented “Streams” so you could control your sharing and privacy for each group of people you interact with. Your profile picture, your display-name and whether or not you are a 'member' are publicly viewable. The rest of your privacy is controlled Stream-byStream. Currently, there are two kinds of Streams:
Private Streams: By default, private streams are only viewable by you. You can share your private streams with others by sharing one or more posts from that Stream. Whomever you share a post with will be able to see and comment on any post in that same Stream. This allows you to choose, on a Stream-by-Stream basis, who sees your content.
Public Streams: Anybody can see your public Streams.
Deleting and Changing Your Content
You can change your e-mail and your account name on your Profile page. You can delete Posts individually any time your are logged in, under the Stream Settings menu when you are on the Post. When you delete the last Posts in a Stream, the Stream will be automatically deleted as well. You can delete an entire Stream, with all its posts, from the Stream Settings menu.
We are working on tools to help you delete your whole Account more easily. In the mean time, if you wish to delete your account, please contact us directly.

The Way Imikimi Uses Information
If you submit personally identifiable information to us through the Imikimi Sites, then we use your personal information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Imikimi Sites.
Any personal information or image content that you voluntarily disclose online (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, within your public profile page, etc.) becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by others. Your account name (not your email address) is displayed to other Users when you upload and modify images or send messages through the Imikimi Sites and other Users can contact you through messages and comments. Any images that you submit to the Imikimi Sites may be redistributed through the internet and other media channels, and may be viewed by the general public.
We do not use your email address or other personally identifiable information to send commercial or marketing messages without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may, however, use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major Imikimi Site changes or for customer service purposes).
We use both your personally identifiable information and certain non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of the Imikimi Sites and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing User preferences and trends.
We use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Imikimi Sites; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.; (e) provide customer service; and (f) track your entries, submissions, and status in promotions, sweepstakes, and contests.
When Imikimi Discloses Information
We may store or process personally identifiable information using third-party companies. We do not share personally identifiable information for any reason. We require that these parties agree to process such information in compliance with our privacy policy, and we use reasonable efforts to limit their use of such information and to use other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
We may share non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with third-parties for assistance in improving our products.
We may release personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information if required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright Law) or respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant.
Imikimi also reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information that Imikimi believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our Terms of Use, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend itself against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of our web site, and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Imikimi, our Users or others.

Our Commitment To Data Security
Imikimi uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information.
