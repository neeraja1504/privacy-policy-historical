What are cookies?
Cookies are small text files that are stored by the browser (for example, Internet Explorer or Safari) on
your computer or mobile phone. They allow websites to store things including your user preferences.
Think of cookies as providing a ‘memory’ for the website, so that it can recognize you when you come
back and respond appropriately.
How do we use cookies?
On our Site, you may encounter the following types of cookie:
Site performance cookies
Anonymous analytics cookies
Geotargetting cookies
Registration cookies
Advertising cookies
Third party advertising cookies
Site performance cookies
This type of cookie remembers your preferences for tools found on the Company’s website, so you don’t
have to re-set them each time you visit. Examples include:
– Volume settings for our video player
– Whether you see new content first
– Video streaming speeds that are compatible with your browser
Anonymous analytics cookies:
Every time someone visits our website, software provided by another organization generates an
“anonymous analytics cookie.” These cookies can tell us whether or not you have visited the site before.
Your browser will tell us if you have these cookies and, if you don’t, we generate new ones. This allows
us to track how many individual users we have, and how often they visit the site.
Unless you are signed in to the Site, we cannot use these cookies to identify individuals. We use them to
gather statistics, for example, the number of visits to a page. If you are logged in, we will also know the
details you gave to us for this, such as your username and email address.
Geotargetting cookies
These cookies are used by software which tries to work out what country you are in from the information
supplied by your browser when you click on a web page. This cookie is completely anonymous, and we
only use it to help target our content – such as whether you see a country specific home page – and
advertising.
Registration cookies
When you register with us, we generate cookies that let us know whether you are signed in or not. Our
servers use these cookies to work out which account you are signed in with, and if you are allowed access
to a particular service. It also allows us to associate any comments you post with your username. If you
have not selected “keep me signed in”, your cookies get deleted when you either close your browser or
shut down your computer. While you are signed into either of the sites, we combine information from
your registration cookies with analytics cookies, which we could use to identify which pages you have
seen.
Advertising cookies
These cookies allow us to know whether or not you’ve seen a particular ad or a type of advertisement,
and how long it is since you’ve seen it. We also use cookies to help us use targeted advertising. We may
use cookies set by another organization so we can more accurately target advertising to you. These
cookies are anonymous – they store information about what you are looking at on our site, but not about
who you are.
Third party advertising cookies
Some content you see on the Site is provided by other organizations. Some of these organizations use
their own anonymous cookies to track how many people have seen a particular ad, or to track how many
people have seen it more than once. The companies that generate these cookies have their
own privacy policies, and we have no access to read or write these cookies. These organizations may use
their cookies to anonymously target advertising to you on other websites, based on your visit to the Site.
Other third party cookies
On some pages of our website, other organizations may also set their own anonymous cookies. They do
this to track the success of their application, or to customize the application for you. Because of how
cookies work, our website cannot access these cookies, nor can the other organization access the data in
cookies we use on our website.
How do I turn cookies off?
It is usually possible to stop your browser accepting cookies, or to stop it accepting cookies from a
particular website. However, we cannot tell if you are signed in without using cookies, so you would not
be able to post comments.
All modern browsers allow you to change your cookie settings. You can usually find these settings in the
Options or Preferences menu of your browser. To understand these settings, the following links may be
helpful, or you can use the Help option in your browser for more details.
Cookie settings in Internet Explorer
Cookie settings in Firefox
Cookie settings in Chrome
Cookie settings in Safari web and iOS.
If you are primarily concerned about third party cookies generated by advertisers, you can turn these off
by going to the Your Online Choices site.
You can also visit the trade body representing these advertising platforms for more information: Network
Advertising Initiative.
