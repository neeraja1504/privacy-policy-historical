By your decision to submit your personal information to Australia Immigration Professionals through its website and/or via the application and/or using any of the methods described in this Privacy Policy, you hereby declare and obligate the following:
A.  Personal information that you provide to Australia Immigration Professionals belongs to you and is accurate, complete and correct.

Minors
To the extent that your consent is a basis for collecting personal information about you, there is an age requirement for you to be at least 16 years of age (or to be at least 13 years of age, if this is what has been determined by the law in your country). In the event that you do not meet the minimum age requirements, you must receive consent from your parent or guardian so that information can be processed in adherence to this Privacy Policy, and if you lack such consent, Australia Immigration Professionals will not provide you with its services and/or products. Australia Immigration Professionals reserves the right, at the discretion of the company, to request information and proof regarding your age.
Australia Immigration Professionals recognizes the need to provide further privacy protections with respect to personal information the company may process from children on our websites, channels and applications. Personal information for underage individuals (aged 16 and less) will be stored only after their legal guardian consents, and will be used only to deliver the application to the relevant authorities. Australia Immigration Professionals won’t register an individual 16 years old (or younger) as a client.

Data Controller
Australia Immigration Professionals serves as the Data Controller of the personal information about you.

Each company in the Group conducts certain activities that make up a portion of the Group’s overall activity, which involves relocation, immigration, and education. In this activity, the members of the Group share among themselves personal information about individuals for their internal purposes.
Thus, personal information that Australia Immigration Professionals collects about you may be shared with the other companies in the Group and these other companies may utilize that personal information only for their internal requirements. Similarly, personal information collected about you by other companies in the Group may be shared with Australia Immigration Professionals, which will utilize it only for its internal purposes.
In each of the above cases, Australia Immigration Professionals and the other companies in the Group will be considered “Joint Data Controllers” in regards to personal information about you, and they will be responsible individually and collectively for complying with the requirements to safeguard your personal information.
If you would like to realize your rights about personal information or should you have any questions about activities related to the processing of your personal information, please feel free to contact Australia Immigration Professionals, which will handle your request even if it involves another member of the Group, at the company’s address provided above, or by sending an email to: privacy@immiproaustralia.com.au
