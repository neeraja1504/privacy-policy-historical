By accessing and using this website, you agree and consent (and your parent/legal guardian agrees and consents on your behalf, if you are under the age of majority in your jurisdiction of residence) to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information as outlined in this Policy.
If you have any questions about this Policy, please contact us as indicated in the How to Contact Us section below. We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, so please check this Privacy Policy periodically for changes. Your continued access or use of this website after any such changes constitutes your acceptance (and the acceptance of your parent/legal guardian on your behalf, if you are under the age of majority in your jurisdiction of residence) of the Privacy Policy as revised.
This Privacy Policy applies to our websites located at www.brightsparktravel.ca and www.breakawaytours.com and any of our other sites that link to this Privacy Policy. We refer to all of these sites as the “Website.”
We collect two basic types of information: personal information and anonymous information. We define “personal information” as information that is about an identifiable individual. Personal information might include: names, ages, contact information, payment information, school affiliation and travel schedule and preferences. “Anonymous information” is information that does not identify you, such as technical information about your computer or anonymous statistical information about groups of our users.
We collect both personal information and anonymous information through the Website. We sometimes collect personal information and anonymous information by asking you to enter it into forms on our Website. For example, if you make a request for more information about one of our trips, we request your name, e-mail, phone number, the name of your school and other details.  We also collect anonymous information automatically as you use the Website—see the section below titled Cookies and Analytics.
If we do receive your personal information, we will only use it for the purposes described where it is collected or as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. For example, we may use the personal information you provide to:
respond to your questions or comments- for example, if you request more information about a trip, we will use your contact details to send you that information.
administer our promotions and Website;
fulfill your purchase, subscription or order;
to otherwise provide or improve our products and services; and/or
to carry out other purposes which are disclosed to you and to which you consent.
We will not share your personal information with third-parties unless:
you give us your express permission to do so;
it is to your parent or guardian if you are a minor;
it is to your trip organizer, if you are part of a group trip; you, or your parent or guardian if you are a minor, consent to this by participating in a group trip;
it is necessary to allow our service providers or agents to provide services for us;
it is necessary in order to provide you with our products or services that you have requested or to contact you;
it is to other subsidiaries of TUI Travel PLC, for the purposes described in this Policy;
subject to applicable contractual or legal restrictions, it is disclosed to entities that perform marketing services on our behalf or to other entities with whom we have joint marketing agreements;
in connection with the sale, merger, or acquisition of our business;
it is necessary to process payments from you;
it is necessary to investigate potential fraud or security breaches;
it is for any other purpose to which you consent; or
otherwise as we are required or permitted by law.
We reserve the right to disclose any personal information as needed if such information is requested by law enforcement agencies or if we are requested to do so by law, regulation, court order, or by a government entity. We may also disclose your personal information to third parties if we have reason to believe that disclosing such information is necessary to: (i) conduct investigations of possible breaches of law; (ii) cooperate in any legal investigation; (iii) identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating the Terms of Use of this Website; or (iv) to protect our rights, privacy, safety or property. In addition, we may disclose anonymous information to third-parties for marketing and other business purposes. For example, we may provide anonymous information to advertisers and commercial partners about the size and demographic composition of our user base.
We may feature contests, sweepstakes or other promotions on our Website from time to time. These promotions may require you to provide personal information in order to join and we may use this information to administer the promotion. With your consent, we may also use the information you provide to market our products and services to you. With your consent, we may also share this information with our partners who may use such information to communicate with you about the contests, sweepstakes or other promotions or their products and services.
With your permission, we may from time to time contact you with information on offers of goods and services, brochures, new products and forthcoming events. You can sign up for these communications when you register to use the Website, complete a transaction on the Website, or wherever we offer you the opportunity to sign up. You may opt-out of receiving marketing communications at any time by emailing emailus@brightsparktravel.ca or by following the opt-out instructions in our marketing e-mails.
