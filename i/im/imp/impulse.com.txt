SafeConnect Network Access Control (NAC)
Effective Date: May 25, 2018
This privacy policy explains what information Impulse Point, LLC. (“us”, “we”, or “our”) gathers about individuals that use an Organization’s Network, where access to that Network is managed by Impulse’s SafeConnect™ Network Access Control (NAC) Solution (the “Service”).
SafeConnect NAC enables organizations to take more proactive measures in ensuring a secure IT infrastructure. The goal is to provide for an environment free of security threats and vulnerabilities—which promotes the exchange of ideas, information, and content to create a positive and productive network environment for all parties.
Each Organization maintains full and complete control over their own policies and how, or even if, these policies are enforced. Each Organization determines their strategy for allowing full access, warnings, quarantines, and remediation.
This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data.
Where we do use your data, we use it to provide and improve the Service. By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.
Definitions
Service
Service is the SafeConnect NAC and associated client application, known as the Policy key, provided and operated by Impulse Point, LLC.
Personal Data
Personal Data means data about a living individual who can be identified from those data (or from those and other information either in our possession or likely to come into our possession).
Usage Data
Usage Data is data collected automatically either generated by the use of the Service or from the Service infrastructure itself (for example, the duration of a page visit).
Cookies
Cookies are small pieces of data stored on your device (computer or mobile device).
Data Controller
Data Controller means the natural or legal person who (either alone or jointly or in common with other persons) determines the purposes for which and the manner in which any personal information are, or are to be, processed.  For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, Impulse Point, LLC and your Organization’s SafeConnect administrator are a Data Controller of your Personal Data. ** **
Data Processors (or Service Providers)
Data Processor (or Service Provider) means any natural or legal person who processes the data on behalf of the Data Controller.  We may use the services of various Service Providers in order to process your data more effectively.
Data Subject (or User)
Data Subject is any living individual who is using our Service and is the subject of Personal Data.  With respect to privacy, there are three classes of users of this system:
Service Administrators: Employees of Impulse Point, LLC that support the Service.  Impulse Point LLC. employees do not have access to the data being protected by the Service and will only access the operational data of a specific Organization if provided permission by the organizational administrator.
Organization Administrators: Organizational administrators do not have access to the data being protected by the Service but do have access to the operational data collected by the Service.  If you are an administrator in an Organization using SafeConnect NAC, you will interact with Impulse Point LLC regarding the rights of your Organization and users.
Individual Users: Individual Users that use the Service are required to comply to the network access policies of the Organization providing the SafeConnect NAC managed Network.  If you are a user at an organization subscribing to the Service, you will interact with your organizations SafeConnect NAC administrator regarding your rights. Opting to permit the organization to collect limited personal data may be a stipulation of the Organization to permit access to the Organization’s network.
Network
The Local Area Network whose access is being managed by SafeConnect NAC.  The portion of the Network managed by SafeConnect is based on the policies and configuration provided by the Organization.
Organization
The institution using SafeConnect NAC to manage access to their Network.
Information Collection And Use
The software installed as part of the SafeConnect NAC Solution (i.e., the Policy Key) does not report or log any activity other than what is required to ensure end user compliance with the endpoint security policies set forth by the organization.
No sensitive personal information is collected or stored. In situations where the end user device is found to be out of compliance with stated security policies, the SafeConnect solution will warn or quarantine the endpoint device based on the policies defined by the organization within the SafeConnect Policy Manager.
SafeConnect collects no information until it is configured by the user’s policy administrator. All queries of a user’s device must be explicitly formulated by the organization’s policy administrator before they can be evaluated by SafeConnect. SafeConnect does not gather any personal information, or perform any checks, that is not configured by a policy administrator.
Additionally, SafeConnect has been designed with personal privacy in mind and can only respond to a limited range of true/false questions. These questions center around the health and configuration of the endpoint and the impact it may be having on network performance. The system cannot respond to open-ended questions, or general requests for information. The system can only return a true/false answer and the transaction occurs over an encrypted communications channel. For example, “Is XYZ anti-virus software up to date and running on this device?” The answer is either true or false.
Types of Data Collected
** Personal Data**
No direct, sensitive Personal Data about an individual is collected.  However, Operational Data related to the use of the Organization’s Network is collected to permit SafeConnect NAC to provide visibility into the use of the Organization’s Network.  The collection of this data is intended to protect both the Network and the users on the Network and thereby help secure Personal Data.
** Operational Data (Usage Data)**
SafeConnect NAC collects Operational information on how and when the Organization’s Network is accessed (“Operational Data”).

Security of Data
Real-time policy status metrics of endpoint devices under policy management are kept in a secure database within the SafeConnect Policy Enforcer Appliance, which remains on the organization’s premises. The SafeConnect system database contains no information that can link directly back to end user personal content. The data collected is related only to the status of specific policies defined by the organization.
Under certain circumstances end users may be denied Network access and quarantined based on the organization’s acceptable use policy enforcement rules. In such circumstances the system provides remediation guidance to the end user to become compliant with security policy. As always, the data collected is related only to policy status and it is used solely for statistical trending and compliance auditing by the organization.
In short, Impulse will never collect or store personal information from its customer’s constituents and will never communicate directly with end users outside of an Organization’s SafeConnect Managed Network environment.

Does the SafeConnect solution collect sensitive personal information?
No. SafeConnect does not gather any information, or perform any checks, that are not configured by a policy administrator. SafeConnect is completely passive until it is configured by the organization’s policy administrator. All queries of a user’s machine must be explicitly formulated by the organization’s policy administrator before they can be evaluated by SafeConnect. Impulse will never collect or store personal information from its customer’s constituents.
What is a Policy Key?
The SafeConnect Policy Key is a lightweight persistent client agent (less than 1MB in size). The SafeConnect Policy Key certifies that the endpoint device adheres to the specific endpoint security policies of the organization on a continuous/real-time basis.
How do you get a Policy Key?
The Policy Key is downloaded to a new user as part of the device registration process. It can also be pre-distributed via the organization’s software distribution mechanism of choice for managed environments, such as MS SCCM, Zenworks or through active directory group policies.
Can you refuse to have a Policy Key installed on your computer?
Yes. However, the decision on who can, and cannot, access an Organization’s Network remains with the organization that owns and manages the network. Many organizations require that users must read, accept, and adhere to a collection of Acceptable Use Polices (AUP) as a condition of gaining access to the Network. This may include the installation of a policy key. This, of course, is the decision of the Organization.
Does the Policy Key stay on the computer forever?
No. The SafeConnect Policy Key automatically dissolves (uninstalls itself) after a pre-determined time of inactivity. Users can also uninstall the policy key themselves if they choose.
How can I be sure that SafeConnect is not gathering sensitive personal information?
Impulse is committed to protecting the privacy of your Organization and the end user community you support. We have established security, technology, and business processes to ensure that sensitive personal information is never collected or stored by our applications or services.
An independent examination of our privacy practices certifies that Impulse and the SafeConnect solution both conform to the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA) standards. The completion of a Service Organization Controls – Type 2 (SOC 2) Privacy Report resulted in an independent CPA firm finding that Impulse’s Privacy Statement is accurate.
