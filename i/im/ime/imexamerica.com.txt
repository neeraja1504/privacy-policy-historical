How we will use your personal information
We are committed to collecting and using your personal information fairly and transparently, so we will make it clear if we are collecting personal information from you or intend to use it for any purpose that is not obvious.
We use the personal information that you provide to us for our internal purposes, such as responding to your requests for information, contacting you, conducting internal analyses, and processing and completing orders and event registrations.
The IMEX Group also reserves the right to compile, save, use within the scope of our activities, and analyse any and all data (contact and personal data, use history, etc.) that we collect from you through the Website.
We may disclose personal information to a third party, such as a law enforcement agency, if required to do so by law.
Opt in preferences – the IMEX Group and third parties
When you submit personal information to us through the Registration Pages on this Website, you will be given an opportunity to opt in to receiving information from us and from selected third parties. When such permission is granted, we may provide lists containing your name, company, title, address, telephone number and/or email address to third parties and our affiliates for their direct and indirect marketing and promotional purposes, and we may use your personal information for the same purposes.
The IMEX Group will not pass your personal information to any third party for marketing purposes without your consent.
If you initially elect to opt in to either the IMEX Group or third party mailing lists, and later decide that you would like to opt out, you may email us at privacy@imexexhibitions.com. Please keep in mind that although the IMEX Group strives to update our mailing list database as frequently as possible, it may take up to ten days to process email requests, during which time your information might be communicated to another party in connection with a mailing list. Additionally, you should be aware that any mailing lists that have been provided to third parties prior to your election to opt out cannot be retrieved by the IMEX Group, and you cannot retroactively opt out with respect to such third parties.
Sharing your personal information with vendors
We may share the personal information you provide to us with other companies we have hired to provide services for us. These companies – our vendors – are contractually bound to use personal information that we share with them only to perform the services we have hired them to provide.
Security
We will take care to ensure that your personal information is secure. When we do provide mailing
lists to third parties or vendors we enter into agreements with such parties requiring them to comply with all applicable laws, and prohibiting further distribution or disclosure of the lists to other parties.
Transferring personal information overseas
Our website is hosted and backed up on a server in Germany.
We may transfer your personal information to countries outside the European Economic Area (where lower levels of data protection may apply) to make arrangements for any exhibition you have registered to attend, or in any other case where we have your specific consent.
Your rights
You have the right to access personal information we hold on you.
You can ask us to correct any personal information we hold on you.
To review the information IMEX currently holds on you, please email privacy@imexexhibitions.com and request to view your contact and demographic information.
Changes to your personal information
Please let us know if any personal information you have given us changes, so we can keep our records up-to-date.
