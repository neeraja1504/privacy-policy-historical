Privacy Policy
IMS Health is committed to protecting the online privacy of our visitors' personally identifiable information. To better protect your privacy online, this statement explains our online information practices at this Website.
What Information We Collect and How We Use It
We may collect the following types of personally identifiable information at this website: name, address, e-mail, and telephone number. We also may collect additional information, including credit card and other billing information, when you register to purchase products and services available through our network of websites.
We use this information to enable you to purchase our products and services on-line, to enable delivery of products and services to you on-line, to process payments for purchase of products and services on-line, to respond to your requests, which include providing you with our product and service updates, to enable you to participate in surveys or questionnaires posted on our website, and to provide you with opportunities to learn about other products, programs, or services that we believe may be of interest to you. Generally speaking, we do not share personally identifiable information with unrelated third parties who are not covered by this privacy statement without your prior permission.
Careers
__At the Careers section of our site, visitors can submit resume information, enabling individuals to express their interest in becoming part of the IMS Health team. To provide you with these services, we have contracted with Workday, which processes your information according to instructions from IMS Health. Our Privacy Statement does not cover Workday's collection and use of your information in connection with this service. For more information on Workday's privacy practice, consult its privacy policy at www.workday.com.
E-mail
__IMS Health and/or its affiliates occasionally send e-mail and promotional notifications to users of its network of sites, products and services. IMS Health may also engage third-party vendors to act on our behalf and administer our e-mail services, which would require disclosure of the e-mail address you provided to IMS Health to such vendors, acting on our instructions. We may use this information in the aggregate to analyze the effectiveness of our e-mail and promotional notifications and site usage, either by IMS Health, or through our third-party e-mail provider. If you wish to discontinue receipt of e-mail or promotional notifications from IMS Health, please contact the IMS Health customer service center at  optout@imshealth.com, with the word “remove” in the subject line to be removed from our promotional mailing lists, or follow the “unsubscribe” instructions at the end of the e-mail or promotional notification.

__We may collect certain non-personally identifiable information about our visitors when you visit many of our webpages, such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using, (e.g., Windows 2000 or Mac OS), and the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online, Earthlink).
We use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our site and to enable us to better personalize your Internet experience. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze site usage.
Legal Process and Outside Parties
