Use of Cookies
The Website uses "cookies" to save you time and personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. A cookie tells the web server that you have returned to a specific page and helps the web server to recall your customized features. Information transmitted through cookies is not considered Personal Information unless it contains information that personally identifies you.
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies; please refer to your web browser's instructions. However, if you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to experience certain interactive features of the Website.
We may use third parties to better understand your user preferences and deliver targeted advertisements to you. These third parties may also place cookies on your computer. This policy does not apply to, and IMS Ghaziabad is not responsible for, cookies placed or data collected by such third parties.
Monitoring
We may, but are not obligated to, monitor and retain any and all data you transmit through our servers, including without limitation communications sent through or posted on the Website's discussion forums, chat rooms, and messaging functions, whether or not marked "private" by you. You acknowledge and agree that you have no expectation of privacy with respect to any such data transmitted, and you consent to any monitoring we may conduct.
Security of your Personal Information
We use commercially reasonable efforts to secure your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We secure the Personal Information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We also use industry-standard encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol, to protect certain kinds of information transmitted through the Website, such as your account password. Unfortunately, there are many factors beyond our control that could result in disclosure of Personal Information or any other information that you provide to us, and no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, we cannot ensure, and we disclaim any warranties or representations relating to, the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.

You may review, correct, update, or delete your Personal Information maintained by us. Please provide us with sufficient proof of your identity and appropriate documentation of corrections to be made. You can contact us at: director@ims-ghaziabad.ac.in.
Please note that certain Personal Information, such as your date of birth or age, cannot be deleted from a user account unless you cancel your account.
