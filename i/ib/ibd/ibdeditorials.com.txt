When a user makes a purchase from either IBD or its affiliates, the companies collect and share that purchase information so we can tailor the Services to our users' preferences.  We may also receive additional information from certain third parties (e.g., researchers, analysts, and/or marketers) that provide us with statistical, demographic, or other similar information. Further, we may also combine your online information with information we obtain from offline sources, including, without limitation, information that you may provide us with over the phone and information obtained from our business partners.
INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES
The Services use cookies, web beacons, pixels, and other tracking technologies to collect information about your use of the Services, including without limitation, your browser type and version, IP address, operating system and platform, when you open email that we send you, and other similar information.  This information helps us to provide the Services, including, without limitation, to improve and enhance the user experience and help us understand the behavior of our users. Cookies are messages placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website or page. For example, the messages store information so that our Services may immediately recognize you each time you visit. This permits us to personalize our Services for each user, allow access to the secure parts of our Services that individual users have registered for, and provide users with up-to-date information about their own account.
We may also use cookies to deliver ads, store visitor preferences, record session information, such as items that visitors add to their shopping cart, record user-specific information on what pages users access or visit, track and record past activity at the Site (or on other Services) in order to provide better service when visitors return to our Site (or other Services), customize web page content based on visitors' browser type, or other information that the visitor sends.  Additionally, cookies are used to serve ads to logged-in users based on the voluntary information they provide in their Investing Profile.  To remove or update information from your Investing Profile, please do so here: http://myibd.investors.com. If you choose to disable cookies, you may find that certain sections and functionalities of our Services will not work properly or at all.
Web beacons, also called web bugs and clear GIFs are used in combination with cookies to help us understand the behavior of our users. A web beacon is typically a transparent graphic image that is placed on our site or in an email. The use of a web beacon allows IBD to record the simple actions of the user opening the page that contains the beacon. When a user's browser requests information from a website in this way, certain simple information can also be gathered, such as: the IP address of your computer; time the material was viewed; the type of browser that retrieved the image; and the existence of cookies previously set by that server. Web beacons provide a convenient way of gathering statistics and managing cookies.
IBD and other third parties may collect and store information (including personal information) locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage (including HTML 5) and application data caches.  If you want to adjust your settings for or delete all local storage mechanisms, go to your browser's settings to do so.  If information is stored in local storage in addition to a cookie, you will need to remove both the local storage and the cookie in order to fully delete the information.  We may also use local shared objects, sometimes known as Flash cookies, to store your preferences or display content based upon what you view on our Services to personalize your visit. Advertisers and other third party services also may use Flash cookies to collect and/or store information. Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies.

We do not provide third party ad serving companies with your name, address, or telephone number. In the course of serving advertisements to the Services, third party ad serving companies may place or recognize a unique "cookie" through your browser (or use your advertising ID in an environment that does not support cookies). In addition, we may use web beacons, provided by third party advertising companies, to help manage and optimize our online advertising.

HOW DOES IBD PROTECT MY PERSONAL INFORMATION?
SECURITY MEASURES AND SAFEGUARDS
The security of our users' information is very important to us. When users submit personal information via the Services, that information is protected by generally accepted industry standards, and in accordance with applicable data privacy laws, including both online and off-line security measures and safeguards. IBD uses a combination of administrative, technical, personnel, and physical measures to safeguard personal information in its possession against loss, theft, and unauthorized use, disclosure, or modification. However, no one can guarantee the complete safety of your information. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting IBD Customer Success in accordance with the instructions below.  However, please remember that no method of electronic storage or transmission over the internet is one-hundred percent secure and therefore, while we strive to use commercially reasonable means to protect your personal information, and will comply with applicable data privacy laws, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of such information.
PHISHING
Phishing is a term used to describe a type of internet scam in which inauthentic emails that appear to be coming from a legitimate source are sent in an attempt to trick you into providing confidential information. These emails usually invoke a sense of urgency and often imply that your account is about to be closed unless immediate action is taken. They will often ask you to click on a link that leads you to a webpage that simulates that of the legitimate source, but it is really a page specially designed to get you to input your confidential information such as account number, password, social security number, or credit card number. The thieves then use that information to commit fraud and identity theft against you.
The Office of the Comptroller of Currency has set up a website providing information warning consumers about the dangers of these scams and how to protect yourself. To learn more about phishing, please click on the following link: www.occ.gov/consumer/phishing.htm.
Please know that Investor's Business Daily takes the privacy of our subscribers very seriously. If you ever question the legitimacy of an email or other communication from IBD, please contact Customer Success at: 1-800-831-2525 or outside the United States at +1-310-448-6600. If you believe you have been the victim of a scam, you can file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission at: www.consumer.gov/idtheft/. If you have any additional questions about the security of our Services, you can contact us at www.askinvestorshelp.force.com/s/.
DO NOT TRACK SIGNALS
At this time, IBD does not recognize or respond to browser's "Do Not Track" signals.
DATA RETENTION
We will retain your information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes for their collection as outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is either mandated by IBD's contractual requirements, internal policies, or otherwise required or allowed by law.  However, remember that even after you cancel your account, copies of some information from your account may remain viewable in some circumstances where, for example, you have posted or shared information with social media or other users or services.  Because of the nature of caching technology, your account may not be instantly inaccessible.  We may also retain backup information related to your account on our servers for some time after cancelation for fraud detection or to comply with Applicable Laws or our internal security policies.  It is not always possible to completely remove or delete all of your information due to technical constraints, contractual, financial, or legal requirements. For example, if you request that IBD no longer send you emails, IBD would need your name and email address to ensure that you no longer receive emails from us. Where it is not possible to remove or delete all information, IBD shall continue to safeguard your information as detailed herein.
SENSITIVE INFORMATION
We do not intentionally collect sensitive personal information, such as social security numbers, political opinions, religious or other beliefs, health information, criminal background information, sexual history or sexual orientation information, or trade union membership (" Sensitive Information ") and we ask that you do not disclose it on the Services.  However, if Sensitive Information is included in your posts on the Services, we will have access to such information described above and such information will be treated in the same way as information that is not sensitive.
CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS
Pursuant to California's " Shine the Light " law, California residents may opt-out of IBD's disclosure of personal information to third parties for such third parties' direct marketing purposes. Note, however, opting out does not prohibit disclosures for non-marketing purposes. You may opt-out by: (1) sending an email to IBD Customer Success at: www.askinvestorshelp.force.com/s/; or (2) Calling IBD Customer Success at 1-800-831-2525 or outside the United States at +1-310-448-6600.

If such a situation is discovered, we will delete that information immediately. If you believe IBD has any information from a child under the age of thirteen (13), please contact us at www.askinvestorshelp.force.com/s/.

All changes will be posted on the Site.  If the changes are significant we will notify you by email (at the last email we have on file for you) or by prominently posting a notice on our Services. Changes will become effective as of the earlier of the date we post the revised privacy policy, send an email detailing any changes, or post such a notice.
