IBC Privacy Policy - IBC.org
IBC (International Broadcasting Convention) is committed to protecting your privacy.  When you request information from IBC, sign up to any of our services or buy things from us, The International Broadcasting Convention obtains information about you.  This statement explains how we look after that information and what we do with it.
We have a legal duty under the Data Protection Act to prevent your information falling into the wrong hands.  We must also ensure that the data we hold is accurate, adequate, relevant and not excessive.
Normally the only information we hold comes directly from you.  Whenever we collect information from you, we will make it clear which information is required in order to provide you with the information, service or goods you need.  You do not have to provide us with any additional information unless you choose to.  We store your information securely on our computer system, we restrict access to those who have a need to know, and we train our staff in handling the information securely.
We would also like to contact you in future to tell you about other services we provide, and ways in which you might like to support IBC.  You have the right to ask us not to contact you in this way.  We will always aim to provide a clear method for you to opt out.  You can also contact us directly at any time to tell us not to send you any future marketing material.
You have the right to a copy of all the information we hold about you (apart from a very few things which we may be obliged to withhold because they concern other people as well as you).  To obtain a copy, either ask for an application form to be sent to you, or write to the Data Protection Officer at The International Broadcasting Convention.  There is a no charge for a copy of your data. We aim to reply as promptly as we can and, in any case, within the legal maximum of 40 days.
