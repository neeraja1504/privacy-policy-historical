Privacy/Security with iBuyOfficeSupply.com
The personal information that you give us when ordering products from us is kept confidential by iBuyOfficeSupply.com. We do not sell, trade, or lease our customer files, mailing or email lists.
Ordering by Credit Card, Is it safe? What is SSL?
We are using Secure Sockets Layer protocol on our servers. By using SSL Protocols, your information is encrypted so that no one else can read it while it is being entered and stored on our servers.
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol is currently the most widely used method for performing secure transactions on the Web and is supported by most Web servers and clients including Netscape® Navigator and Microsoft® Internet Explorer. The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol provides several features that make it particularly suitable for use in e-commerce transactions.
Privacy is guaranteed through encryption. Although information can still be intercepted by a third party they will be unable to read it as they have no access to the encryption key.
Integrity is also ensured through encryption. If information is received that will not decrypt properly then the recipient knows that the information has been tampered with during transmission.
Authentication is provided through digital certificates. Digital certificates provide the basis for secure electronic transactions as they enable all participants in a transaction to quickly and easily verify the identity of the other participants. Essentially, SSL is secret-key encryption nested within public-key encryption, authenticated through the use of certificates.
The reason that both secret-key and public-key encryption methods are used is because of the relatively slow speed of public-key encryption compared to secret-key encryption. Initially, the client and server exchange public keys, and then the client generates a private encryption key that is used only for this transaction. This is referred to as a session key. The client then encrypts the session key with the server's public key and sends it to the server. For the rest of the transaction, the client and the server can use the session key for private-key encryption.
