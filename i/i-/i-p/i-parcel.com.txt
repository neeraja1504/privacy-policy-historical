In addition, when you visit our website, we may collect certain information by automated means.  The information collected in this manner may include IP address, unique device identifier, browser characteristics, device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, information on actions taken, and dates and times of activity.  We also may collect this information when you visit our merchant partners’ checkout pages.
When you visit our website or our merchant partners’ checkout pages, this information may be collected through “cookies,” web beacons and other automated means.  A “cookie” is a text file that websites send to a visitor’s computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser.  A “web beacon,” also known as a spotlight tag, Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, links web pages to web servers and their cookies and may be used to transmit information collected through cookies back to a web server. Through these automated collection efforts, i-parcel obtains and stores “clickstream data” and other information to tell us about our visitors’ usage.
We also may use third-party web analytics services on our website, such as those of Google Analytics.  These service providers help us analyze how visitors use the site.  The information obtained for this purpose (including your IP address and other information collected by automated means) will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers.  To learn about opting out of Google Analytics, please click here.
Your browser may tell you how to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies or how to restrict or disable certain types of cookies.  Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to use all of the features of our site.  Both we and others (such as our advertising networks) may collect personal information about our visitors’ online activities, over time and across third-party websites, when using our site.

i-parcel also may use the information we obtain about you in other ways for which we provide specific notice at the time of collection.
Interest-Based Advertising
On our website, both i-parcel and certain third parties may collect information about your online activities for use in providing you with advertising about products and services tailored to your individual interests.  This section of our Privacy Notice provides details and explains how to exercise your choices.
You may see certain ads on other websites because i-parcel participates in advertising networks.  Ad networks allow us to target our messaging to users through demographic, interest-based and contextual means.  These networks track your online activities over time by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of cookies, web server logs and web beacons.  The networks use this information to show you advertisements that may be tailored to your individual interests.  The information ad networks may collect includes information about your visits to websites that participate in the relevant advertising networks, such as the pages or advertisements you view and the actions you take on the websites.  This data collection may take place both on our site and on third-party websites that participate in the ad networks.  This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.  To learn about how to opt out of this ad network interest-based advertising, click here.
Our site is not designed to respond to “do not track” signals from browsers.
**Information We Share   **
i-parcel does not sell or otherwise share personal information about you, except as described in this Privacy Notice.  i-parcel shares personal information with third parties, including UPS affiliates, who perform services on our behalf based on our instructions.  These third parties are not authorized by us to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements.  Any personal information we obtain from the merchant partner checkout web page is shared back with that merchant.
i-parcel also may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law, regulation or legal process (such as a court order or subpoena); (ii) in response to requests by government agencies, such as law enforcement authorities; or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.  i-parcel reserves the right to transfer any information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets (including in the event of a reorganization, dissolution or liquidation).

Data Transfers
We may transfer the personal information we collect about you to countries other than the country in which the information originally was collected.  Those countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the information.  When we transfer your information to other countries, we will protect that information as described in this Privacy Notice and in accordance with applicable law.  We use contractual protections for the transfer of personal information among various jurisdictions (including, for example, the European Commission’s standard contractual clauses).
