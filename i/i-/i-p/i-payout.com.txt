i-payout takes data security seriously and offers our users a secure alternative payment solution that can be used with confidence over the Internet as well as over all cellular phone networks. i-payout’s mission is to provide consumers with the most secure, reliable, fast and easy payment solution available for use on the Internet and cell phones. Users protect their accounts from misuse by selecting a unique Username (i.e., their Associate, Member or Distributor number or a self-chosen Username) and by selecting their own User Password during the sign-up process. Thereafter, users can quickly and easily access their funds and perform multiple transactions from their accounts. Passwords can easily be changed by the User and we highly encourage that users do so on a regular basis.
