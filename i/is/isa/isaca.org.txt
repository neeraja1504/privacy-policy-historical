C. _   _Information for Individuals Located in the European Union.
Legal Basis for The Processing of Personal Information from EEA Residents
If you reside within the European Economic Area (EEA), our processing of your personal information will be legitimized as follows:
(i) Whenever we require your consent for the processing of your personal information such processing will be justified pursuant to Article 6(1) lit. (a) of the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“GDPR”). This article in the GDPR describes when processing can be done lawfully.
(ii) If the processing of your personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract between you and ISACA or for taking any pre-contractual steps upon your request, such processing will be based on GDPR Article 6(1) lit. (b).”). If this data is not processed, ISACA will not be able to execute the contract with you.
(iii) Where the processing is necessary for us to comply with a legal obligation, we will process your information on basis of GDPR Article 6(1) lit. (c), for example complying in the fields of employment law.
(iv) And where the processing is necessary for the purposes of ISACA’s legitimate interests, such processing will be made in accordance with GDPR Article 6(1) lit. (f), for example to detect fraud.
(v) You may also receive personalized advertising where you indicate to ISACA specific interests by requesting information about a product or service or by indicating your marketing preferences in the Preference Center (access to which is provided at the bottom of this page), however, you may also receive general
Transferring Personal Data from the EU to the US:
ISACA has its headquarters in the United States. Information we collect from you will be processed in the United States. The United States has not sought nor received a finding of “adequacy” from the European Union under Article 45 of the GDPR). A finding of “adequacy” in short means that the European Commission has decided that this country outside the EEA ensures an adequate level of data protection. ISACA relies on derogations as set forth in Article 49 of the GDPR as the United States has no “adequacy” decision and no other safeguards under the GDPR are in place (for example binding corporate rules on the transfer outside the EEA). In particular, ISACA collects and transfers to the U.S. personal data only: with your explicit consent; to perform a contract with you; in a manner that does not outweigh your rights and freedoms. If this data is not processed and transferred, ISACA will not be able to execute the contract with you or you will not have access to any or all of the benefits and features associated with your transaction. ISACA endeavors to apply suitable safeguards to protect the privacy and security of your personal data and to use it only consistent with your relationship with ISACA and the practices described in this Privacy Notice. ISACA also minimizes the risk to your rights and freedoms by not collecting or storing sensitive information about you.
