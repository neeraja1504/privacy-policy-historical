We strongly recommend that you read these third parties' privacy policies prior to providing any information to such sites. iSoftStone has no responsibility or liability in connection with any third parties' websites.
Collection, Use and Transfer of Your Information
You can visit most of the iSoftStone site without disclosing your personally-identifiable information ("personal data"). However, you may choose to provide us with your personal data, for example when you contact us, register for seminars, activities and programs available on our website or when you request information or services.
You also may decide to provide us voluntarily with personal data of a third person, such as your spouse, colleague or friend. In such case, we assume that you have unrestricted permission from such person to provide his/her personal data to iSoftStone.
iSoftStone may use suppliers to collect, process, store, use, analyze and/or transfer the data on its behalf. In such case, it is iSoftStone practice to require that these suppliers handle the personal data they process or transfer in a manner consistent with iSoftStone's policies. By submitting personal data to us, you acknowledge and agree with your data being processed and/or transferred on iSoftStone's behalf by its suppliers.
