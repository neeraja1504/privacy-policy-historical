Information We Gather

We may use your email address to send administrative email messages to you from time to time. For certain premium services in the future, we may also request credit card or other payment account information. We may gather other limited information about you, including information about your viewing history, the Internet Protocol address of your originating Internet Service Provider and the type of browser you are using.
How We Use Your Information

We will not send you newsletters or any advertising, except if you have explicitly consented to allow such communications (by "opting-in"). At the same time, we reserve the right to send you notices necessary to maintain your account with iSLCollective.
We will not sell or rent such information of yours to any third party. We handle your sensitive personal information confidentially. We will only disclose your sensitive personal information to a third party if obligated by law to do so.
