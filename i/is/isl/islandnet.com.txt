Where customers do not pay or contest invoices within 150 days of Islandnet mailing or otherwise transmitting an invoice to the customer, Islandnet reserve the right to share information about the customer's payment practices with an appropriate credit reporting agency and to have such information become a permanent part of the customer's credit rating.
