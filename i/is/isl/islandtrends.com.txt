Island Trends values customer privacy. The requested personal information, including your name, shipping address, telephone number, e-mail address, billing address, credit card number, and expiration date will not be sold or traded to mailing list firms.
Island Trends collects that information in order to:
- Process an order
- Verify your identity for payment authorization
- Contact you regarding your order status
- Ship your order to you
- Enter you in a sweepstakes (only if you request)
- Send you an Island Trends newsletter (only if you request)
- Generate anonymous statistics
- Provide you with an excellent shopping experience.
Once Island Trends gathers your name and address, this information will then be transferred to your credit card company, if applicable, for confirmation to complete your purchase. Your shipping information may also be supplied to a third-party fulfillment center (eg UPS), but your name and address will not be used for any other purpose than delivery of your order. Your name and address will not be sold or traded to mailing-list firms.
