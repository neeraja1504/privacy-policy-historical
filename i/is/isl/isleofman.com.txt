isleofman.com - About Us -
This is our privacy policy and aims to explain what information we collect and what it is used for. If you have any questions or concerns regarding this statement please email us at information@isleofman.com
We use the personal data you may provide solely for the reason that caused you to do so. We do not sell or pass that information on to further parties.
Sometimes we may be working with other partners and information provided by you may be shared. Whenever this happens, you will be made clearly aware of this arrangement.
Cookies
We use cookies at isleofman.com to provide us with visitor and user statistics but that use does not identify you as a person.
If you purchase anything through our online shopping cart, cookies will be used whilst purchasing is in process and you will be identified as a person so that we can process your order (because you give us your name and address). If you do not wish that personal identification to occur please do not purchase any items. That usage would not allow us to identify you as an individual when you next visit the website.
You can still use the website (other than purchasing) without the use of cookies by setting appropriate settings in your web browser software.
