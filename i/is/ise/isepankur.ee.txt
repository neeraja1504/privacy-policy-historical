User Information Security
We follow very strict guidelines on handling User Information, based on the European Union and the Estonian Personal Data Protection laws. User Information refers to any kind of information that we have about the Users. Such information may include a User’s name, place of residence, personal identification code, bank details, which may arise during a User's life cycle.
We guarantee that access to User Information is limited to the Company's employees, whose duties require access to such data. All Company's employees are required to keep information confidential and are forbidden to share it with the third parties except in accordance with the User Agreement or required by legislation.
In addition, the Company reserves the right to provide the Users’ personal data to a contractor, whose contractual obligation is to provide the Company with legal, accounting or auditing services, under the condition of non-disclosure to third parties.
The database registry, storing all of the User's data, is located outside of public access (both physical and virtual). All data access attempts including views, changes or deletions are logged. Access to the registry is digitally and physically secure. Furthermore, cameras and physical access barriers are placed in the offices to ensure that staff’s computers are out of access for third parties.
Secure log-in
An email address is required in order to register a Portal Account with the Company. Our system will send an email with a temporary password, which you will be able to change after the first login.
All Users are required to identify themselves (listing: country of residency, full name, mobile number, personal identification code, document type, document number, document issue date, document issuer, bank name and IBAN account number), in accordance with the law for EU Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing.
If you suspect that your Portal Account could have been accessed by a third person, please contact our Customer Support immediately.
Encryption
All information transmitted between our system and our clients’ computers is encrypted with 128-bit cipher. Additionally, private information and access details in the database are also encrypted.
Timed log-out
In case a User remains inactive for longer than 60 minutes, the system will perform an automatic logout.
Marketing messages
The Company may occasionally use various communication channels to deliver customer experience enhancing messages to the Users. Every User can adjust the settings for preferred messages under the “Settings/ preferred messages” menu at the User's Portal Account.
Some of your browsing data (such as type of a browsing device, visits to the Company’s website, IP address, geographic location, browser type, referral source, length of visit and page views) is collected and used to improve our website’s usability and evaluate marketing campaigns’ success rate.
The Company reserves the right to anonymously use data previously disclosed by a User at any time, including data provided during generation of statistical reports.
User Information recording and archiving
User Information is stored and archived on a secure server with access limited to a number of people. Security is enforced through rigorous privacy protection standards performed by dedicated third party partners.
According to the Personal Data Protection Act, every natural person has the right to check his/her processed, transmitted and archived personal records in the Company’s database. In order to do that please submit a written application to our Customer Support.
When User Information processing is no longer necessary, it is removed from the registry.
Virtual security
A number of Internet security measures have been added to ensure that User Information is processed, transmitted and archived securely.
Servers are located at a data center in Frankfurt, Germany and operated by Telehouse, a global 200 company. Server management is separately contracted to Virtion GmbH. These companies allow us to provide improved availability, better scalability and increased flexibility of our IT resources.
All their activities are carried out in accordance with a number of standards including ISO 27001:2005 (Information Security Management), BS25999-2:2007 (Business Continuity Management), PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry), ISO 9001:2008 quality standards and ISO 14001:2004 (Environmental Management System Standard).
The Company has enforced physical and virtual security 24/7. All internal movements within the data center are monitored by proximity card readers and infra-red intruder sensors.
At the Company security breaches are identified, monitored and warded off by software and hardware firewalls.
Links to Third Party Websites
Links to third party websites from/ to the Company website are provided solely as an access point to obtain useful information on services or topics that may be needed to the Users. Please note that third party websites may have different privacy policies and/or security standards governing their sites. The Company shall bear no liability in relation to third party websites.
