Therefore, visitors to other university websites should review the privacy notices for the particular sites they visit. ScienceNode is not responsible for the content of other websites or for the privacy practices of websites outside the scope of this notice.

Due to the rapidly evolving nature of information technologies, no transmission of data over the Internet can be guaranteed to be completely secure.

However, once we receive your information, we will use reasonable safeguards consistent with prevailing industry standards and commensurate with the sensitivity of the data being stored to maintain the security of that information on our systems.
In addition, we will comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws regarding the privacy and security of visitor information.
