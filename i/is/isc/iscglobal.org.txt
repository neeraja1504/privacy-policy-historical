Tracking Technologies
We, Lux Scientiae and our marketing partners, affiliates, or analytics or online chat service providers, use technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags, and scripts, to analyze trends, administer the website, tracking users' movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis.
We use cookies for our shopping cart, to remember users' settings (e.g. language preference), and for authentication. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our public website, but your ability to use some features or areas of our website may be limited.
HTML5 Local Storage
We use Local Storage (LS) such as HTML5 to store content information and preferences. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSs.
Behavioral Targeting
We partner with a third party ad network to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other Web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking Here and Here. Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.
Newsletters
If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter(s), we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you. Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe.
Choice/Opt-out
We provide you the opportunity to "opt-out" of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information. For example, if you purchase a product/service but do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, you can indicate your preference on our order form.
If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by emailing us at "support @ LuxSci.com".

OpenID
You can log in to our site using sign-in services such as an Open ID provider. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign up form. Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on this Web site to your profile page to share with others within your network.
Additionally, we record all logins to Lux Scientiae by our members and the pages visited by them. This is for security purposes and for the purpose of analyzing what pages and features are being used and with what frequency.
Social Media (Features) and Widgets
Our Web site includes Social Media Features, such as Twitter, Facebook, Google+, a RSS Blog Feed, Widgets, a "Share This" button and interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.
Payments
All payments to Lux Scientiae are made securely online via credit card or PayPal or offline via check, wire transfer, or direct deposit. After you have made a credit card payment, we keep your billing address in our secure database to facilitate future payments. We do not keep any record of your credit card number unless you authorize us to bill you automatically each month. In this case, your credit card information is stored in a PCI-compliant way, not on Lux Scientiae's servers.
Security
The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). [To learn more about SSL, follow this link How Does Secure Socket Layer (SSL or TLS) Work?]
We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
Tell-A-Friend
If you choose to use our referral service to email a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. Lux Scientiae stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.
Your friend may contact us at support @ LuxSci.com to request that we remove this information from our database.
Links to Other Sites
If you click on a link to a third party site, you will leave the Lux Scientiae site you are visiting and go to the site you selected. Because we cannot control the activities of third parties, we cannot accept responsibility for any use of your personally identifiable information by such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy practices as Lux Scientiae. We encourage you to review the privacy statements of any other service provider from whom you request services. If you visit a third party website that is linked to an Lux Scientiae site, you should read that site's privacy statement before providing any personally identifiable information.

Confidentiality
Lux Scientiae staff will not examine the following classes of data without Customer's explicit consent:
Email: The content of sent and received email messages, with the exception of the message metadata including: sender address, recipient addresses, message subject, message size, message id, IP address of the sending or connecting computers, and any message header information removed from messages for the purposes of outbound message anonymization.

Databases: The content of all databases hosted by Customer in its web hosting account.
Files: The content of all files saved to the Customers web/FTP space, except as they may otherwise be publicly accessible on the Internet via Customer's web site. Note that this covers only the content of the files, not the list of what files are present and what directories they are located in.
Information that does not fall within the above classes of data (i.e. email message metadata) will still be kept in the strictest confidence in accordance with Lux Scientiae's non-disclosure policy.
Exception 1: in a case where Lux Scientiae becomes aware of evidence of a possible violation by a client of its Acceptable Use Policy and it concludes that analysis of data is necessary in order to determine the facts, in order to prevent the sending of SPAM, Unsolicited Email, excessive utilization of system resources, or other violations of LuxSci's AUPs, Lux Scientiae will examine such client's data solely for such purpose. The contents of client's data will be kept in the strictest confidence in accordance with Lux Scientiae's non-disclosure policy.

As stated in the High Volume AUP (HVAUP), Lux Scientiae can and will store and/or review the content of any or all outbound email messages sent via the High Volume service to ensure compliance with the High Volume Email Restrictions (see the HVAUP).

Medical privacy (HIPAA)
Clients that are legally required to abide by the regulations of HIPAA (i.e. HIPAA Covered Entities and Business Associates of HIPAA Covered Entities, namely, (1) health plans, (2) health care clearinghouses, or (3) health care providers who electronically transmit any health information in connection with transactions for which the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has adopted standards), Lux Scientiae has the following Addendum to its Master Services Agreement (MSA). This is the "Business Associate Agreement" required for HIPAA compliance between Lux Scientiae, as the "Business Associate", and the Client, as the "Covered Entity".
Due to the Security and Privacy restrictions imposed by the BAA and by HIPAA that are not required for other types of accounts, this Addendum is not automatically incorporated into new or existing Lux Scientiae accounts. If you require a BAA with Lux Scientiae, please print out and sign the BAA and Account Restrictions Agreement using the links below and return them to Lux Scientiae for review and acceptance.
