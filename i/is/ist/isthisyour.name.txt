Your Privacy: Is This Your Name?
Your Privacy
IsThisYourName aims to be a good online citizen. Hence, we respect your privacy. The name-related information on this site is from public sources and is aimed at providing entertaining details about names in general rather than information about any specific individual.
For instance, a search on the name 'John Smith' will return generic information about the first name 'John' mixed with generic information about the surname 'Smith'. Where information relating to an individual is presented, it is only in general name search results returned via a real-time query of publically available data from domain registrars, merchants (e.g., the Amazon.com catalogue), forums or blogs. We do not hold data relating to any specific identifiable individuals in our database. Nor do we intend to.
