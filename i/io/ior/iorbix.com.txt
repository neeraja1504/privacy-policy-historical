We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you access your personal information.
Do we use cookies?

Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computers hard drive through your web browser (if you allow that in its settings) that enables the sites or service providers systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information.
We use cookies to personalise content and ads, to provide social media features and to analyse our traffic. We also share information about your use of our site with our social media, advertising and analytics partners.
We use cookies to temporarily save your login information for your own convenience.
We also use cookies for other special features on iOrbix.
Please read more in our Cookie Policy.
Do we disclose any information to outside parties?
We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others rights, property, or safety.

Your account settings and email notifications
When you register on iOrbix, you are automatically subscribed to the email notifications of its basic features.
However, you may disable some or all notifications via your Account Settings.
On that page, you can edit your account preferences. You may also delete your account if you no longer wish to share your personal information on iOrbix.
Profile Visibility
Profiles on iOrbix are set, by default, to be visible by everyone, including people who are not registered on iOrbix.
This setting can be changed through your Account Settings. You can set your profile visibility to Friends only.
If your profile visibility is set to Public, everyone will be able to see your public comments, shared messages, blog posts, public photos, gifts and other contents that are not private.
Sharing Posts on iOrbix
When you share a message (through the Sharing Box from the homepage or your profile), you control the audience, between Public (everyone can see it) or Friends (only people from your Friends List can see it).
This setting will change its behavior depending on your profile visibility. A post targeting the Public audience will not be visible by everyone if your profile visibility is set to Friends. A post targeting the Friends audience will be visible by people on your Friends List only. If an Album visibility is set to Friends, the visibility of the photo will be to people on your Friends List only. This also means that the post will not appear in the news feed of people who are not on your Friends List.
Sharing Photos on iOrbix
The visibility of the photos you upload on your profile depend on the Album you post into. If an Album visibility is set to Friends, the visibility of the photo will be to people on your Friends List only. This also means that updates about that photo (upload or comments) will not appear in the news feed of people who are not on your Friends List.
Always think before you upload a photo. If someone provides the direct link (URL) to a person that is not on your Friends List, that person will be able to see the photo.
If album visibility is set to Everyone, this setting will change its behavior depending on your profile visibility. This means that if your profile visibility is set to Friends, then the photos in the album will be visible by people on your Friends List only.
