At iOffer, we take your privacy very seriously. Please read this privacy policy (the "Policy") to see how iOffer handles your personal information that you give to us when you register with our website (the "Site"). This Policy is an agreement between iOffer and you, as the user of iOffer’s website. This agreement tells you when the policy is effective, what information we collect from you, how we might use it, how you can review or change the personal information provided to us, how we may change this policy, and the steps we take to ensure that your personal information is protected.
All activities you engage in on the Site are voluntary, and you are not required to provide any personal information to us unless you choose to access features on the Site that require the information.

By using the Site, you signify that you agree to the terms of this privacy policy as well as to our terms of use.
Our main purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with an enjoyable, customized, and efficient experience on our Site. It is our policy to never willfully disclose any personal information about our Members to the general public without their consent. iOffer collects information from you when you register and conduct certain activities on the Site. We collect your full name, valid telephone number, contact/billing information, email address, and physical address. Also, each Member must create a unique user id and password.

This includes your IP address which enables us to identify your computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) network, which includes the World Wide Web. This general information (including click stream data and cookies) may be collected from you whenever you access the site whether or not you provide us with any personal information.

We may use click stream data (i.e., server address, domain name) to analyze and better customize your visits. Such uses may include traffic analysis or ecommerce analysis of our website to determine which features are most or least effective or useful to you.
We may also use cookies to gather information about your visits to the iOffer Site and enhance your user experience.

The financial data collected from iOffer is to bill you for iOffer’s services. Other information collected from iOffer Members is used to improve product offerings, customize our Site's content and layout, and for marketing and statistical efforts. Occasionally, we will send you emails about new services or promotions. You can always opt-out of receiving any information from us, but please understand that such a request will likely limit your ability to take advantage of all of the features and services available on iOffer.
Our number one priority is to keep your personal information private and confidential. Except as set forth herein we will not willfully disclose your personal information to third parties. And we will not rent or sell your personal information to anyone. However, certain personal information will be made available to others in the process of using our Site. This information includes:
Other visitors to our Site may view your user ID, rating, city, and other items you have for sale;
In order to complete the transaction, the buyer and seller are provided with each others email and postal address;
When making an offer, the seller can view your user ID, rating and your city.
Of course once you provide personal information to a buyer or seller on our Site, iOffer has no control over how that information is used by that individual. You should discuss any privacy concerns you may have with any individual you meet through our Site, as the only protection you will have is whatever terms you agree to directly with this individual.
In addition, we provide some of our services through contractual arrangements with affiliates, services providers, partners and other third parties (collectively "service partners"). Our service partners may use your personal information to operate our sites and to deliver their services. For example, your data may be transferred to website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in designing and operating the website, executing services or helping us analyze collected data. These parties will only use your data for the purpose of carrying out the work as agreed with us and will be required to keep the information confidential. We will encourage our service partners to adopt and post privacy policies. However, the use of your personal information by our service partners is governed by the privacy policies of those service partners and is not subject to our control.
iOffer will disclose your personally identifiable information to others under the following circumstances:
You consent to share the information;

Your actions on our Site are, or appear to be, in violation of the Terms of Service and disclosure of this information will assist in efforts to enforce the Terms of Service;

We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful, as determined in our sole discretion. Release of your personal data for security purposes, as described in this agreement to any person or entity under any circumstances shall be based on a determination made solely by us, exercising our sole discretion, permission for which is expressly granted by you to us in accordance with this policy.
Nothing in this Policy shall limit, prohibit, or otherwise deny the ability of iOffer to (1) transfer, assign, or sell its assets, including, without limitation, the assets of our Site, to a third party or (2) dispose of its assets in any manner through bankruptcy or similar proceeding. iOffer also makes no representations regarding, and disclaims all liability arising out of or related to, the accuracy or completeness of the information it collects and discloses through our Site.
