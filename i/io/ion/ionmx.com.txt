IonMX Privacy and Terms of Use Policy
IonMX Privacy and Terms of Use Policy
Bluestreak’s IonMX (“IonMX”) is a permission based email marketing platform that
enables our customers (“Customers”) to build lasting relationships by deploying email
messages. BlueStreak takes privacy and responsible marketing very seriously.
All the data that is captured by IonMX is owned and managed by our individual
Customers who are contractually bound to adhere to the terms of this Privacy and Terms
of Use Policy in any and all uses of the Bluestreak IonMX E-Mail Platform. Customers
who violate this Policy are subject to suspension of their license to use IonMX and/or
termination of their contract(s) with Bluestreak.
Our Customers’ use of any information you may provide to them is not controlled by
Bluestreak, and under no circumstances are we responsible for the privacy practices of
any Customer. Email recipients are encouraged to read the privacy policies of all web
sites they visit prior to submitting any information to those web sites.
If you believe that a Bluestreak Customer is in violation of this Policy, please contact us
at privacylist@Bluestreak.com.
How do I exercise my privacy choices? How do I opt-out of IonMX?
As outlined below, Bluestreak requires Customers to include an easy to use unsubscribe
mechanism within the body of each email deployed via IonMX. Moreover, we provide a
global “opt-out” mechanism, which allows you to “opt-out” of all email communications
sent by our Customers via IonMX by clicking the link below:
Opt out of IonMX
Note that another IonMX Customer may in the future collect your email address and use
it in the IonMX system, at which time you may need to renew your opt-out choice.

Does Bluestreak use cookies and/or Web Beacons in connection with IonMX?
BlueStreak uses cookies in connection with IonMX. A cookie is a small bit of data,
which includes an anonymous unique identifier that is sent to your computer’s browser
from a web site's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. Bluestreak uses
cookies to help Customers understand the effectiveness of their campaigns.
BlueStreak also uses web beacons in connection with IonMX. A web beacon is a small
piece of code that can be placed on a web page. We use web beacons in HTML versions
of emails that we send and that our Customers send using IonMX in order to keep track
of how many of those emails have been opened. We also use, and provide our Customers
with, the capability to track when a URL has been clicked within the body of an email
message sent via IonMX. We use this functionality to track which links were clicked and
in what quantity, as well as the aggregate number of links clicked.
Does BlueStreak disclose this information to third parties?
When a web visitor interacts with an email served from IonMX, they may voluntarily
provide Personally Identifiable Information such as an email address, a telephone number
or postal address. Any such voluntarily provided Personally Identifiable Information is
transferred to our Customer via IonMX. The information collected is the sole property of
the Customer, and BlueStreak generally does not sell, rent, trade, or give this information
to a third party. This data is transferred securely to the Customer, and may only be
archived by BlueStreak to prevent loss of information.
However, we do reserve the right to disclose any information that we hold as required by
law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply
with a judicial proceeding, court order, or other legal process. BlueStreak also reserves
the right to share Customer information in connection with the sale, merger,
consolidation, change in control, transfer of substantial asset, or reorganization or
liquidation of our business, but will take reasonable steps to ensure that the information
shared is used in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.
How does Bluestreak ensure the security of any information collected via IonMX?
The security of any information collected via IonMX is important to Bluestreak. We
follow generally accepted industry standards in order to protect the information collected
by and stored within IonMX from loss, alteration or misuse, including the use of
encryption and password controls. We also limit employee access to this information to
that which is necessary to perform their jobs. No method of transmission over the
Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we
strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot
guarantee its absolute security.
How does Bluestreak communicate changes to this Privacy and Terms of Use
Policy?

and Terms of Use Policy at any time. If we make any material change to this Privacy and
