8. Information Collected through Cookies and Similar Tracking Technology
iolo websites and our business partners’ websites use “cookies” and similar tracking technologies (such as web beacons, tags, scripts and device identifiers). We may receive reports from business partners based on use of these technologies. These reports may provide this information on an individual as well as on an aggregated basis. Aggregate information is anonymous and may include demographic, usage, and sales information.
8.1 Cookies
A cookie is a text file that is either stored in your computer’s memory temporarily and automatically deleted when you close your browser (a session cookie) or placed on your hard drive (a persistent cookie) by a web page server. A persistent cookie is not deleted when the browser is closed. iolo uses both session cookies and persistent cookies. While iolo cookies do not save any personal information, they do save the serial number of any product licenses, which can be connected to your personal information such as email address, billing address and IP address. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. Please refer to your web browser for more information. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use other interactive features of iolo websites and services that depend on cookies.
We use cookies to:
save your preferences and other information on your computer in order to save you time by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter the same information;
improve our websites;
display personalized (targeted) content and appropriate iolo product offerings on your later visits to our websites and to our partners’ and affiliates’ websites;
allow you to sign in to our services and to help personalize and customize your online experience;
gather demographic information about our users;
offer our products and services to you;
tailor product discounts and purchase links;
monitor the success of marketing programs;
provide analytics regarding the use of our website, products and services; and
provide security to attempt to identify and prevent fraud.
Because iolo relies on third-party advertising networks who may track you across websites over time for advertising purposes, we are not able to respond to your selection of the “Do Not Track”” option provided by your browser. We cannot advise on whether your selection of “Do Not Track” option will have any effect on the collection of cookie information by the third-parties who collect such cookie information on our websites.
8.2 Web Beacons
A “web beacon” is an electronic image that can be used to recognize a cookie on your computer when you view a web page or email. Our business partners use web beacons on our websites, in our emails, in our advertisements on other websites (including social media), and in our advertisements contained in third party emails sent to you. Web beacons help us measure the effectiveness of our websites and our advertising in various ways for example, by counting the number of individuals who visit our websites from a particular advertisement or who make a purchase from our websites after viewing a particular advertisement as well as by telling us when a web page is viewed and providing a description of the page where the web beacon is placed. Web beacons also help us measure the effectiveness of our email campaigns, for example, by counting the number of individuals who open or act upon an email message, determining when an email message is opened and determining how many times an email message is forwarded. This helps us send more relevant advertisements to our users and on the websites most visited by you.
Unlike cookies, you cannot decline web beacons. However, setting your browser to decline cookies may help prevent web beacons tracking your activity.
8.3 Analytic Tools
We may use tools such as Google Analytics to better understand who is using our websites and how they are using them. These tools may use cookies and web beacons to save and collect information such as time of visit, pages visited, time spent on each page of the website, IP address, and type of operating system used. We may use this information to manage and improve our websites and to improve your experience with our websites. You can learn how to opt-out of Google Analytics tracking software at this website: http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.
9. Third-Party Websites and Services

Please be aware that, in providing services on iolo’s behalf, our business partners may collect personal information about you.
10. Retention, Storing and Transfer of Personal Information
We will maintain your personal information for a period of two years from your last contact with us, unless we need to maintain it longer to comply with legal, tax, audit or other reporting requirements, and for the detection and prevention of fraud or other unlawful behavior.
Personal information collected may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which iolo or its business partners maintain facilities, and these countries may have laws that are different from those of your country of residence. By using iolo products and services, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.
