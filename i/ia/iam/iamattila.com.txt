Privacy Policy:
i Am Corporation, Inc. (" I Am Corporation ") operates iAmAttila.com and may operate other websites. It is I Am Corporation's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.
Website Visitors
Like most website operators, I Am Corporation collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. I Am Corporation's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how I Am Corporation's visitors use its website. From time to time, I Am Corporation may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
I Am Corporation also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on iAmAttila.com blogs/sites. I Am Corporation only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog/site where the comment was left.
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to I Am Corporation's websites choose to interact with I Am Corporation in ways that require I Am Corporation to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that I Am Corporation gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up at iAmAttila.com to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with I Am Corporation are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, I Am Corporation collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with I Am Corporation. I Am Corporation does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using I Am Corporation's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.
