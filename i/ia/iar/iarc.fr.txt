Privacy policy – IARC
What information does IARC collect?
Normal website usage
In general, you can browse the IARC site without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. The only information we gather during general browsing is from standard server logs. These include your IP (Internet Protocol) address, domain name, browser type, operating system, and information such as the website that referred you to us, the files you download, the pages you visit, and the dates/times of those visits.
Collection of personally identifiable information
If you register for a newsletter, log on to certain IARC sites, order a book, request information, provide feedback, apply for a job, join a discussion group, or join an electronic mailing list, you will be asked to provide personal information such as your name, postal address, and email address.
This information is collected only with your knowledge and permission, and is kept in various IARC databases and mailing lists. If you are purchasing ebooks using the web, you may be asked to provide your credit card details. These details are transferred to a secure, online payment service, hosted outside IARC. Credit card information is not retained by IARC. However, ebook sales transacted through third-party services are subject to service providers′ own policies. Cardholder data may be transferred, processed, and stored outside of EU Member States, and as set forth in the payment service provider′s Privacy Policy, may be subject to disclosure as required by applicable law. IARC is not responsible for the privacy policies or content of third-party sites.
IARC sites with specific requirements to collect personal information may publish a privacy policy specific for that site. In these cases, the site-specific policies will be complementary to this general IARC privacy policy but will give additional details for that particular site.
For certain IARC sites, registering or supplying personal information sets a cookie*. By setting this cookie, IARC will remember your details the next time you visit, so you don′t have to re-enter the information. This helps us to provide you with a better service.
Joining electronic discussion groups may mean that other participants of the discussion group (including non-IARC employees) will see personal information that you have volunteered. For open discussion groups, this information will be public.
