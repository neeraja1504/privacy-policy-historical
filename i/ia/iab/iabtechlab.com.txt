COLLECTING NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION
We use third party operational service providers ( see “Information Sharing” below) and technology that can collect and transmit information that is associated with computers and devices that visit our Digital Properties.  Data gathered via these technologies do not personally identify you. Although the term “cookie” commonly is used to refer to a small text file stored on a computer that can log visits to web sites and/or can contain log-in information so you don’t have to re-enter information each time you visit, we will use the term “cookie” to refer generically to any technology that can collect or transmit information about visits to our Digital Properties. “Cookie” information typically includes such data as the referral web domain, the type of operating system and browser you are using, mobile device identifiers, the date and time of your visit, location data, information relating to activities on our Digital Properties ( e.g. , “clickstream” data) and other technical attributes of visits to our Digital Properties.

Cookies store information that allows our Digital Property to recognize a user’s computer or access device each time it is used to visit our Digital Property and cookies can keep count of how often you return to our Digital Property. Cookies can also track how you use our Digital Property, your preferences for features and functions, and can store information such as your log-in information, so you don’t have to re-enter them each time you return to our Digital Property. We do not use cookies to retrieve information from your computer or device for purposes that are unrelated to our Digital Property or your interaction with our Digital Property. You may stop or restrict cookies on your computer or purge them from your browser by adjusting your web browser preferences and you should consult the operating instructions that apply to your browser for instructions should you wish to do so and in general to determine how best to configure your browser settings to meet your requirements.
