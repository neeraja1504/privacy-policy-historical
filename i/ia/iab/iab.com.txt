Privacy Policy
Effective Date: July 19, 2018
This is our official Privacy Policy which forms part of your legal agreement with us UNDER OUR TERMS OF USE. Please read our Privacy Policy carefully to be sure you understand how we collect and use information and under what circumstances we share information.
CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY
We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to modify, add or delete provisions of this Privacy Policy at any time. We will post the effective date of any change at the top of this Privacy Policy. Your use of our Website, which includes the Member Portal, after the effective date of any such modification means you accept and agree to be bound by the Privacy Policy, as modified. We urge you to come back to this page and review this Privacy Policy regularly so that you remain aware of the terms and conditions that apply to you.
COLLECTING PERSONAL INFORMATION
“Personal Information” may include information such as your name, postal address, email, and telephone number. You voluntarily provide this information to us, for example, when you register with our Website (e.g., to access the Member Portal) or make a request for information or services. We may use this information for purposes including responding to your requests as well as to provide you access to interactive features (i.e., conferences or webinars). See the section entitled “How We Use Information” for more detail. We do not sell or rent your Personal Information to others except as otherwise disclosed in this policy. If necessary, our Website may collect payment and payment instrument information from you for the purpose of billing you for products, services, or event tickets you purchase through our Website.
COLLECTING NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION
We use “cookies,” which are small text files stored on your computer/device (and maintained by your browser), and often include a randomized unique identifier so that our Website can ‘recognize’ this cookie again. We primarily use cookies that are considered ‘mandatory’ or ‘technically necessary’ to provide our Website and its core functionality to you (e.g., cookies that store your log-in information or remember other settings, so you don’t have to re-enter them each time you return to our Website), and Google Analytics for audience measurement purposes (as described below). Please note that we do not use, or engage other operational service providers or entities to use on our behalf, retargeting cookies (e.g., cookies that track you on our Website and across other websites in order to serve you a targeted advertisement) or other cookies that may track your experience on our Website in order to build user profiles. Should our use of cookies change in the future, we will update this Privacy Policy and notify you appropriately before such use (including obtaining your consent, as applicable).
We also use Google Analytics to obtain high-level “audience measurement” data such as the referral web domain, type of operating system/browser used, date and time of visit, and other information relating to activities on our Website to understand its usage better, analyze trends, and optimize the Website experience. To help ensure such data within Google Analytics cannot be linked back to an identifiable user, the last octet of all IP Addresses collected have been anonymized, ‘Sharing With Google,’ ‘Remarketing and Advertising,’ and ‘Demographics and Interests’ features have been disabled, and retention of analytics has been set to 14 months. For more information on Google Analytics, including how to opt-out please click here: https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245.
We do not use cookies to retrieve information from your computer or device for purposes that are unrelated to our Website or your interaction with our Website. You may stop or restrict cookies on your computer or purge them from your browser by adjusting your web browser preferences and you should consult the operating instructions that apply to your browser for instructions should you wish to do so and in general to determine how best to configure your browser settings to meet your requirements. Note that if you “turn off,” purge, or disable cookies, although you may still use our Website, you may not be able to use all of the features, functions, or services available on our Website.
