Order and credit card Information
IPmart.com uses Global Collect, a third-party provider of e-commerce solutions, to power the IPmart.com store and in doing so, collects information about users, including credit card information. When a user purchases a product from the IPmart.com store, Global Collect provides information about the customer, including name, address and email address, to IPmart Network. IPmart Network uses this information as set out in the end user agreement, agreed to by purchasers at the time of purchase. In particular, IPmart Network uses the information to license the software to you, support the software and send you information about updates, upgrades and new works or services provided by IPmart Network.
Global Collect requests information from the user on the order form, viewed by the user as a page hosted on the Global Collect web server. Here a user must provide contact information (like name and shipping address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used as explained above. For example, if we have trouble processing an order, contact information is used to get in touch with the user.
Your credit card information does not pass through the Global Collect sites under the terms of IPmart's agreement with Global Collect. Global Collect does not share credit card information with IPmart Network. Global Collect keeps your credit card information confidential and protect your credit card information through the use of industry-standard Secure Sockets (SSL) encryption technology.
