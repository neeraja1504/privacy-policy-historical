Use of Cookies
The Website uses "cookies" to identify a user's session on the Website and thereby offers continuity as the member moves around the site.  Cookies are only used on the Website to store non-critical data.  Cookies are pieces of information that websites transfer to your computer's hard drive for record-keeping purposes.
Cookies allow websites to maintain user information across connections.  They are small strings of characters used by many websites to deliver data to your computer, and in certain circumstances, return the information to the website.  Cookies contain only information that members volunteer, and they do not have the capability of infiltrating a user's hard drive and stealing personal information.  The simple function of a cookie is that of helping the user navigate a website with as little obstruction as possible.

In an attempt to provide increased value to our users, iPay88 may link to sites operated by third parties.  However, even if the third party is affiliated with iPay88, iPay88 has no control over these linked sites, all of which have separate privacy and data collection practices, independent of iPay88.  These linked sites are only for your convenience and therefore you access them at your own risk.
