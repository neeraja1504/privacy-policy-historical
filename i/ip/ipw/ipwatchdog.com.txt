At some places on IPWatchdog.com, the use of a “cookie” may be offered. Most browsers now recognize when a “cookie” is offered, and permit the user to opt out of receiving it.

If you respond to a survey question, to the best of our knowledge and understanding the companies used to periodically conduct survey questions do not collect any personally identifiable information about any visitors. Notwithstanding, surveys are routinely set up so that the surveys will count only the first response entered from a particular computer. This will prevent one or more individuals from skewing the data set by voting multiple times. In order to accomplish this a cookie is placed on the users computer that will identify that a particular computer has already responded to a particular survey question.
IPWatchdog provides direct links to books sold through other parties, for example Amazon.com or the Practising Law Institute (PLI).  If the user wishes to purchase a book or product sold through a third party the relationship will be solely between that third party and the purchaser.
