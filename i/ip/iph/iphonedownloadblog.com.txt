Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy discloses the privacy practices for the iDownloadBlog.com website, its mobile application, our email newsletter, and other applications owned and operated by iDownloadBlog.com (collectively referred to as the “iDB Services”), and to any services that display this notice. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, unless otherwise noted, all references to “iDB,” “iDownloadBlog,” and “iDownloadBlog.com” include iDownloadBlog.com and its mobile application.

Ownership of information
iDownloadBlog is the sole owner of any information collected on our website.
Comments/message boards
iDB Services contain comment sections (a.k.a. message boards). We do not actively monitor these comments and the information on them is for entertainment purposes only. If we are alerted to something we deem inappropriate in any way, we may delete it at our discretion. We use email validation on our message boards in order to reduce “comment spam.” These email addresses will not be shared with any third party and not used for any other purpose. In short, we will not send you unwanted emails.

Email newsletter
Readers can opt in to receive email newsletters. The email addresses collected for this are handled by Feedburner, a service by Google. We do not use your email address for anything else but sending you this newsletter. If you wish to unsubscribe, please see the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the newsletter you receive.

The use of cookies, or similar technologies by ad networks and content providers is subject to their own privacy policies, not that of iDownloadBlog.
Traffic reports
Our industry-standard traffic reporting records IP addresses, Internet service provider information, referrer strings, browser types and the date and time pages are loaded. We use this information in the aggregate only to provide traffic statistics to advertisers and to figure out which features and editorials are most popular.
