IPRental - Privacy Policy
European Safe Harbor Policy
IPRental (“IPRental”) strives to collect, use and disclose personal information in a manner consistent with the laws of the countries in which it does business. IPRental complies with the Safe Harbor Principles developed by the U. S. Department of Commerce and the European Commission. This Safe Harbor Policy sets forth the privacy principles that IPRental follows with respect to transfer of personal information anywhere in the world, including transfers from the European Union to the United States.
Notice
This policy, as amended from time to time, covers how IPRental and its agents treat personal information that IPRental collects and receives in connection with your use of its website (“Site”). Personal information is information about an identified or identifiable individual, like your name, mailing address, country of residence, email address, phone and fax number, credit card number, billing and shipping information, IP address, employer, job title and department, and other data that can be tied to your name and is not otherwise publicly available. This policy does not apply to the practices of organizations that IPRental does not own or control, or to people that IPRental does not employ or manage **.   **
IPRental collects personal information when you create your account, when you use IPRental services, and when you visit IPRental pages. When you register we ask for information such as your name, address, email address,  zip code, phone number, and your intended use of our site. Once you register with IPRental and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us.  You agree and acknowledge that personal information collected by use through the Site or in connection with the services may be transferred across national boundaries and stored and processed in the United States. You also acknowledge that with respect to certain activities, the collection, transfer, storage, and processing of your personal information may be undertaken by trusted third party vendors or agents of IPRental, such as credit card companies and web analytic providers, to help facilitate certain functions of IPRental activities. Such third parties are bound by contract with IPRental not to use your personal information for their own purposes or provide it to any third parties except as otherwise allowed under this policy.
We use your personal information for general business purposes,  in connection with the provision of services, billing and collections.  IPRental automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address and theIP addresses you use. IPRental does not log browsing data or history correlated to your personal computer, does not store cookies, or IP address or web sites you have visited. IPRental’s binary application does not contain any Adware or Spyware.
When you use the Site and its services, IPRental may also collect certain information about your computer to facilitate, evaluate and verify your use of the Site and the services offered. For example, we may log environmental variables, such as browser type, operating system, CPU speed, referring or exit web pages, click patterns, Session IDs ( a unique identifier assigned to the browser in connection to the Site), and the Internet Protocol(IP) address of your computer. IPRental also uses such information to measure traffic patterns on the Site and usage of the services.  IPRental may use aggregate, non-identifying statistical data for improving the Site and our services, providing more relevant experiences to our customers and for statistical analysis. We do not match such information with personal information, except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.
IPRental does not rent, sell, share or otherwise release any personal information. Except as otherwise provided in the Privacy Policy, we will keep your personal information private and will not share it with third parties, unless such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with a court order or other legal process; (b) protect our rights or property; or (c) enforce our End User License Agreement. We will transfer information about you to an acquiring company if IPRental is acquired by or merged with another company.
We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to the IPRental service, such as service announcements, administrative messages,  and other messages that are considered part of your IPRental account, without offering you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving them.
Choice :
IPRental only uses your personal information for its general business purposes. You have the right to withhold the personal data required for registration, and to change it.  However,  in that event, IPRental cannot allow you to use  the Site or provide you services without the personal information requested in the registration process.
Please regularly review this Privacy Policy. If you have objections to it, you should immediately discontinue use of the Site and the services enabled by the Site and follow the procedure described in Section 6 of the End User License Agreement. IPRental may change this Privacy Policy from time to time at its sole discretion and will provide notice of all such changes through indication in the Privacy Policy itself and in the footer of the web pages with links to the Privacy Policy. If as a result of the changes to the Privacy Policy you want to alter the way in which IPRental is allowed to use your personal information, you can do so by following the instructions set forth in Section 6 of the End User License Agreement.  You will be deemed to have been aware of, and will be subject to, the changes in the Privacy Policy after such notice has been posted.
Data Integrity
IPRental will use personal information only in ways that are compatible with the purposes for which it was collected or subsequently authorized. IPRental will take reasonable steps to ensure that personal information is relevant to its intended use, accurate, complete and current.
Onward Transfer
IPRental will comply with the notice and choice principles as described above for all data which is disclosed or transferred to a third party (“agent”).
IPRental will obtain assurances from its agent that they will safeguard personal information consistently with this policy. IPRental will require that its agents either (i) subscribe to the EU Safe Harbor Principles, the EU Data Protection Directive or another adequacy finding; or (ii) enter into a written agreement with IPRental requiring them to provide the same level of protection as IPRental.
Security
IPRental will take reasonable precautions to protect personal information in its possession from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. IPRental limits access to personal information to those persons in the IPRental organization, or agents of IPRental, that have specific business purposes for maintaining and processing such information and data. Individuals who have been granted access to personal information are aware of their responsibilities to protect the security, confidentiality and integrity of the information.
Personal information provided by you in connection with your use of the Site and services is protected in several ways. You have access to the information you provided upon registration only through use of a password and unique customer ID selected by you. This password is encrypted.  We recommend that you not divulge your password to anyone. Also, your registration information resides on secure servers to which only selected IPRental personnel and contractors have access via password. IPRental encrypts your personal information as it is transferred to IPRental and thereby strives to prevent unauthorized parties from viewing such information.
Access
IPRental will grant users reasonable access to personal information that it holds about them and will take reasonable steps to permit users to correct, amend, or delete information that is demonstrated to be inaccurate or incomplete. IPRental agrees to process all reasonable requests for access within a reasonable time period, but reserves the right to deny access or limit access in cases where the burden or cost of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the individual’s privacy or in the case of a vexatious or fraudulent request.
Enforcement
If you believe that we have not complied with this Privacy Policy with respect to your personal information, please write our IPRental Privacy Officer at info@iprental.com. Please describe in as much detail as possible the ways in which you believe we violated our Privacy Policy. We will investigate your complaint promptly and attempt to resolve the complaints and disputes regarding use and disclosure of personal information in accordance with the principles of this policy.
