DarkViking
Norse Corporation, (“ Norse ”) operates several websites including norse-corp.com, ipviking.com, ipvenger.com, and ipvizor.com. It is Norse’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.
Website Visitors
Like most website operators, Norse collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Norse’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Norse’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Norse may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website. Norse also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on our blogs. Norse only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to Norse’s websites choose to interact with Norse in ways that require Norse to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Norse gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an evaluation account at ipviking.com to provide their name, company, phone number, a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Norse – by purchasing access to the ipviking.com service, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Norse collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Norse. Norse does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
Aggregated Statistics
Norse may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Norse checks and logs the risk score of each incoming ip address to it’s sites.using its ipviking and ipvenger services. Norse may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Norse does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
Norse discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Norse’s behalf or to provide services available at Norse’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Norse’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Norse will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Norse discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Norse believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Norse, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a Norse website and have supplied your email address, Norse may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Norse and our products. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Norse takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
