Legal Basis for Processing
Art. 6(1) a. of the GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which we obtain consent for a processing purpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party, as is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary to provide a service, the processing is based on Article 6(1) b. The same applies to such processing operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries concerning our products or services. If our company is subject to a legal obligation by which processing of personal data is required, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6(1) c. If the processing of personal data may be necessary to protect your vital interests or of another EU natural person, then the processing is based on Art. 6(1) d. Finally, processing operations could be based on Article 6(1) f., if processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by our company or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by your fundamental rights and freedoms under the GDPR.

Please note that while any changes you make will be reflected in active user databases within a reasonable time, we may retain all information you submit for the prevention of fraud and abuse, analytics, satisfaction of legal obligations, or where we otherwise reasonably believe that we have a legitimate reason to do so, such as for archiving purposes within the public interest.
Right of Restriction of Processing
You have the right to restrict processing where one of the following applies:
The accuracy of the personal data is contested by the data subject, for a period enabling the Controller to verify the accuracy of the personal data.
The processing is unlawful and the data subject opposes the erasure of the personal data and requests instead the restriction of their use instead.
The controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but they are required by the data subject for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.
The data subject has objected to processing pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of the controller override those of the data subject.
Right to Data Portability
You may request to receive your personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. You have the right to transmit this data to another controller without interference.
Furthermore, you may have the personal data transmitted directly from one controller to another, where technically feasible and does not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.
Right to Object to Automated Decision Making
You may object to decisions based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects or similarly significantly affects you, as long as the decision is not is necessary for entering into, or performance of, a contract between you and iPiccy; or is not authorized by European Union or Member State law to which you are subject; or is not based on the data subject’s explicit consent.
Right to Objection to Processing

If iPiccy processes personal data for direct marketing purposes, you shall have the right to object at any time to the processing of your personal data for such marketing. This applies to profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing. If you object to iPiccy to the processing for direct marketing purposes, then we will no longer process the personal data for these purposes.
Retention Policy
We only retain the personally identifiable information about you for as long as your User Account remains active or for a limited period of time as long as we need it to provide you with services or otherwise fulfill the purposes for which we have initially collected it, unless otherwise required by law. We will retain and use information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, archival purposes, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
Cross Border Data Transfers
If and when sharing of information sometimes involves cross-border data transfers, for instance to the United States of America and other jurisdictions. We use EU Standard Contract Clauses and other suitable safeguards to permit data transfers from the EU to other countries. The Standard Contractual Clauses commit companies transferring and receiving your personal information to protecting the privacy and security of your data. Copies of our current Standard Contractual Clauses are available on request using the contact details listed below.
