Data Transfers. We rely on our EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield certification to transfer Personal Data that we receive from the EU and Switzerland to iPEC in the U.S. (for more information, please read the “Privacy Shield” section below).
Privacy Shield
iPEC and its subsidiary, New England Coaching, comply with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the transfer of Personal Data from the EU and Switzerland to the U.S. iPEC has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles (described below). If there is any conflict between the policies in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Frameworks, and to view our certification page, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/.
General. We rely on our Privacy Shield certifications to transfer Personal Data that we receive from the EU and Switzerland to the U.S. and we process such Personal Data in accordance with the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability (“ Privacy Shield Principles ”), as described below.
Notice And Choice.  This Privacy Policy provides notice of the Personal Data collected and transferred under the Privacy Shield, the purposes for the transfer and the choice that you have with respect to such Personal Data. It also provides information about other Privacy Shield Principles that are set forth below.
Accountability for Onward Transfers.  We may be accountable for the Personal Data that we transfer to third-party service providers (described in the “Sharing and Disclosure of Information” section above). If such service providers process Personal Data in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, we are responsible for the harm caused.

Our data retention practices are described in the “Data Retention” section of this Privacy Policy.

Our Site, systems, apps and services use physical, electronic and managerial procedures to protect information collected online including firewalls to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of information under our control. However, no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
