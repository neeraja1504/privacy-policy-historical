As between you and iPerceptions, your submission of personal information is voluntary and optional. You may opt out of responding at any time. However, if you do respond, you consent to its provision to iPerceptions for the purpose of delivering the Services to our Customer.

Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer or device. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. iPerceptions may use a third-party tracking service that uses images, scripts, page tags (also known as web beacons) and other tracking technologies to track non-personal information about visitors to our Website in the aggregate.

iPerceptions may use your information to provide Services to Customers, to establish or maintain business relationships or provide them feedback. iPerceptions compiles data collected from its online surveys to produce benchmark reports for Customers as well as media and other interested parties.
