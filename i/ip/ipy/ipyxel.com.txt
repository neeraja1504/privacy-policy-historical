Privacy Policy | ThriveTracker
Effective Date: June 14, 2018
Our most important asset is our relationship with you. We would never jeopardize our trust with you under any circumstances.
ThriveTracker, (“ ThriveTracker,” “we,” “us”) is committed to maintaining the confidentiality, integrity and security of any personal information about our users and provides this Privacy Policy to inform users of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personally identifiable information received from (i) users of this website located at www.thrivetracker.com (“Site”), (ii) users of our online advertising management software platforms and all other software applications available on the Site (collectively, “Subscription Services”, “Services”), and (iii) visitors to websites of our customers on which we place Tags (defined below) (collectively, “Customer Sites”). Please note that this Privacy Policy applies to the information that we collect through (i) this Site, (ii) Subscription Services, and (iii) Customer Sites. This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. We will notify you of any material changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Site. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.
By using our Site, the Subscription Services and Customer Sites, you are consenting to our processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by us. “Processing” means using cookies or Tags (defined below) on a computer or using or touching information in any way, including, but not limited to, collecting, storing, deleting, using, combining and disclosing information, all of which activities will take place in the United States. If you reside outside the U.S. your personally identifiable information will be transferred to the U.S., and processed and stored there under U.S. privacy standards. By visiting our Site or otherwise providing information to us, you consent to such transfer to, and processing in, the U.S. If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy or our use of your personally identifiable information, please contact us at info@thrivetracker.com.
But enough about us - let’s talk about you. Whether you own a business or manage campaigns for clients, you need a tracking platform that takes care of the tedious stuff so you can focus on growth.
YOUR PRIVACY AND INFORMATION ARE NEVER FOR SALE
Our primary goals in collecting personally identifiable information are to provide you with the products and services made available through the Site, including, but not limited, to the Subscription Services, to communicate with you, and to manage your registered user account, if you have one.
Simply put, we do not and will not sell or rent your personal information to anyone, for any reason, at any time. We are especially sensitive to login credentials to external sites that you may provide on our software platforms as a requirement to fully utilize the software capabilities. These private user information will only be used to internally troubleshoot problems, detecting and protecting against errors, preventing fraudulent and criminal activity, to analyze and improve our services to you, to enforce our Terms of Use, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, and otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy.
If you desire to have access to certain restricted sections of the Site, you may be required to become a registered user, and to submit certain personally identifiable information to ThriveTracker. This may happen in a number of instances, such as when you sign up for a free trial of the Subscription Services or you download materials from the Site, if you desire to receive our newsletter or other marketing materials and information, or if you wish to enter into a contests, sweepstakes or promotions (collectively, “Promotions”) we provide via the Site. Personally identifiable information that we may collect in such instances may include your user name, password, company title (if applicable), email address, physical address and telephone number. If you decide to become a paying customer for the Subscription Services, we may collect additional information from you, such as your credit card number or other billing information. If you contact us by email through the Site, we may keep a record of your contact information and correspondence, and may use your email address, and any information that you provide to us in your message, including any information you may provide about your advertising spending, to respond to you. In addition, we may use your contact information to market to you, and provide you with information about, our products and services, including but not limited to our Subscription Services. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such information or communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications or contact us at info@thrivetracker.com.
When you visit the Site, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a web site (“Log Data”). This Log Data may include information such as your internet protocol (“IP”) address, browser type or the domain from which you are visiting, the web-pages you visit, the search terms you use, and any advertisements on which you click. For most users accessing the Internet from an Internet service provider the IP address will be different every time you log on. Except in the instances described herein, we do not use this information to identify you personally. We use it to monitor the use of the Site and of any services or Promotions we provide via the Site including our Subscription Services, and for the Site’s technical administration. But the same pieces of information are considered non- identifying information when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying information (for example, your viewing preferences). For users of the Subscription Services only, we may combine your personally identifiable information with non-identifying information and aggregate it with information collected from Site users to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the services and Promotions we provide via the Site and to analyze and understand how our Site, services and Promotions are used.
COOKIES
Like many web sites, we also use “cookie” technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve the Site and any services or Promotions we provide via the Site including our Subscription Services. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk. We do not use cookies to collect personally identifiable information. ThriveTracker may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with the Site and with and any services or Promotions we provide via the Site including our Subscription Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on the Site, and to improve usability and performance of the Site. A session cookie enables certain features of the Site and our service and is deleted from your computer when you disconnect from or leave the Site. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser help file directions. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the web sites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site.
TAGS
We also use “”web beacons,” “pixel tags,” “clear GIFs” or similar means (individually or collectively “Tags”) on our Site and on Customer Sites. A Tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel, embedded on web pages. Tags are ordinarily not visible to users. Tags allow us to count the number of users who have visited certain pages of the Site or Customer Sites, to deliver branded services and to generate statistics about how our Site and Customer Sites are used.
We use the services of third party companies to help us carry out and measure the effectiveness of our own and Customer advertising campaigns. For example, these third party companies may ensure that you are shown ads at appropriate frequencies, so that you do not see the same ad repeatedly. As part of these services, one or more Tags may be placed on the Site and on Customer Sites. These Tags do not enable third parties to collect your name, e-mail address, phone number or other similar information that directly identifies you. Rather, when you visit the Site or Customer Sites, these Tags will direct your web browser to contact these third party companies, at which time they may set or read a cookie on your device and collect information about your visit – such as your IP address, cookie ID, which parts of the websites are viewed or clicked, and date/time information.
Currently, we use our own Tags on the Site and on Customer Sites to enable collection of information about visitors to our Site and such Customer Sites.
We use information collected from Tags to gather non-personally identifiable information, including, but not limited to, your computer’s IP address, browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Site or the applicable Customer Site, pages of our Site or the applicable Customer Site that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Site or on the applicable Customer Site, access times and dates, and other statistics.
THIRD PARTY INFORMATION COLLECTION/”DO NOT TRACK”
With respect to Ad Servers: To try and bring you offers that are of interest to you, we have relationships with other companies that we allow to place ads on our Site. As a result of your visit to our Site, ad server companies may collect information such as your domain type, your IP address and clickstream information. For further information, consult the privacy policies of the companies representing the ads or http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html.
Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on the Site or to display advertising based upon your web browsing or application activity use Flash cookies and HTML5 to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5. To manage Flash cookies, please click here:  http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html
“Do-Not-Track” is an optional browser setting that allows you to express your preferences regarding tracking by advertisers and other third-parties. We do not currently respond to Do- Not-Track signals.
