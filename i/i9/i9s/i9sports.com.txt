i9 Sports Privacy Policy
Privacy Policy
i9 Sports Corporation ("i9 Sports") is dedicated to making your online experience as interesting and enjoyable as possible. We truly appreciate your presence on our site and at all times understand that you are our guest and should be treated accordingly. To ensure this, we have listed the components of our Privacy Policy below.
Use of Personal Information
Any information you submit through i9 Sports websites will be held in the strictest confidence. In no way will your personal information ever be used without your consent. To ensure this, all forms on our website that send information to a database that may be used in the future (e.g. mailing lists, registration, etc.), have check boxes where you specify whether or not you would like to receive information from us in the future. Forms used just to send email, post messages, etc., do not include the option, but will never be used to send information. Be assured that we do not sell our customer names and/or address lists. If you choose not to receive information from us, there are instructions at the bottom of the email on how to "unsubscribe" from future mailings should you wish to cancel.
The only information we automatically collect is that related to the use of our website. This information is anonymous and is gathered through our server log files. These log files record generic information, such as the number of visits our web site receives, the types of browsers used and the number of files downloaded, but never personal information. This log file information allows us to create better content aimed at our viewer‘s preferences.
Use of Cookies
Some of our pages use a feature of your browser called a "cookie." Cookies, by themselves, are not able to extract any personal information from you. This cookie automatically identifies your computer - but not you - to our servers when you visit our site. Unless you specifically tell us, i9 Sports will never know who you are, even though we may assign your computer a cookie.
Cookies allow us to personalize our website for you and provide you with information that's relevant to you. For instance, once you register for a program, a cookie is written to your computer so that you will not need to re-type information in the future to obtain information relevant to the program you signed up for.
Contact us
i9 Sports knows that your privacy is very important to you. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to contact us at: wecare@i9sports.com.
Because internet technology changes so quickly, i9 Sports reserves the right to modify its Privacy Policy from time to time. More legal information can be found in our Terms of Use.
