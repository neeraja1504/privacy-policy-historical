If you are an Individual User, Idealist may share your information either with your consent, or as otherwise provided in this Agreement.  If you have an Organization account in the capacity of a non-profit for the purposes of hiring employees with Idealist, all information you share, including your organization profile, and all Listings you post, in addition to any of your Contributions, may be viewable through or shared within our Offerings.

We may provide you with discussion or comment features for your use.  In the event you voluntarily disclose Personal Information using an Offering, that information, along with any content in your Contribution, communication or post, can be collected, correlated, and used by others.  This may result in unsolicited messages from or improper and unauthorized use of your Personal Information by third parties.  Such activities are beyond our control, and by using our Offering you acknowledge that such publically posted Contributions may be copied or stored by other Users or third-parties.

5. DATA SECURITY & HOW WE PROTECT INFORMATION
We have implemented measures designed to secure your Personal Information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure.  All information you provide to us is stored on secure servers behind firewalls.  Any payment transactions will be encrypted.  In the case that it is stored by any third parties that we use, your account information may be stored on a secured server behind a firewall.  When you enter sensitive information (like your password), the information is encrypted using secure socket layer technology (SSL). Please note however that despite the implementation of the above security policies, Idealist cannot guarantee that these security measures will prevent other third parties from unauthorized and unlawful access, use, alteration and disclosure of your Personal Information. As such, any transmission of your Personal Information to us is at your own risk.
The safety and security of your information also depends on you.  Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Sites or Mobile Apps, you are responsible for keeping such password(s) confidential.  We ask you not to share your password(s) with anyone, and refresh such password(s) as is deemed prudent.  You can reduce the inherent risks associated with using the Internet by exercising common sense and discretion: for example, you should choose a strong password, use different passwords for different websites and services, and use updated antivirus software.
We do our best to keep your information secure, but you must actively participate in the process of keeping your information safe.  We reserve the right to analyze accounts for fraudulent or irregular behavior and we may limit use of site features in response to possible signs of abuse.  We urge you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of our Offerings, like message boards.  The information you share in public areas may be viewed by any user of our Site(s) and Mobile Apps.  Please timely report any security violations to us as outlined in the section below.

4. YOUR RIGHTS UNDER THE EU GDPR
In addition to the other rights you may have under our Agreement, under the European Data Protection Legislation, you, as a User located in the EEA have the right to:
a) request access to your Personal Information;
b) receive a copy of the Personal Information that you have provided to Idealist in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format so that you can share it with others;
