We will give you the opportunity to opt in to receive marketing information by e-mail from us and we will only send it to you if you do opt in or if you are an existing customer and the information relates to similar items or services to those which you have previously purchased from us. When we send you communications by e-mail, we will give you the opportunity to opt out of receiving such communications from us. It is not our normal practice to send out marketing communications by post or telephone but if we do, you will be able to opt out of receiving such communications from us. However, remember if you opt out of receiving communications from us, particularly by email, that this will preclude you from receiving our special offers or promotions in future.
We will not disclose, sell or rent your personal information to any third party unless you have consented to this. If you do consent to receive marketing information from us or carefully selected third parties but later change your mind, you may contact us by email at any time at customercare@internet-shared.com and we will cease any such activity.

We may also disclose your personal information where we are required to do so by applicable law, by a governmental body or by a law enforcement agency.
Finally, we may also collect anonymous details about users of our Website for the purposes of aggregate statistics or reporting purposes. Certain pages of the Website can sometimes contain electronic images or statistics trackers, which make it possible to count the number of visitors to the page. This can be used with certain partners in order to measure and improve the effectiveness of certain adverts. The information obtained is anonymous and simply makes it possible to gather statistics on the frequency of use of certain pages of the Website. No single individual will be identifiable from the anonymous details we collect for these purposes.
