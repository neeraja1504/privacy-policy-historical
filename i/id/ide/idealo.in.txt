This document is an electronic record in terms of the Information Technology Act, 2000 and rules there under as applicable and the amended provisions pertaining to electronic records in various statutes as amended by the Information Technology Act, 2000. This electronic record is generated by a computer system and does not require any physical or digital signatures.
This document is published in accordance with the provisions of Rule 3 (1) of the Information Technology (Intermediaries guidelines) Rules, 2011 that require the rules and regulations, Privacy Policy and Terms of Use for access or usage of the www.idealo.in website to be published on the website.
Scope
These General Terms and Conditions govern the access, browsing and use of the Internet platform idealo.in (hereinafter also referred to as “websites”), as well as the use of any services they provide. These Terms and Conditions may be amended from time to time. Such amendments take effect immediately upon their publication on these websites. The currently valid version is the version accessible on the websites at the time the Internet user makes concrete use of the websites and their services. By accessing or using any part of the websites or the services they offer, the user agrees to be legally bound by these Terms and Conditions. Otherwise, use of the websites and the services they offer is not permitted. Certain services on the websites, such as the Price Alert, are additionally governed by their own specific conditions, which are clearly posted in the appropriate places. These specific conditions are valid alongside the General Terms and Conditions and take precedence over them in the case of doubt.
These websites are operated by idealo internet GmbH, Ritterstraße 11, 10969 Berlin, Germany (hereinafter also referred to as “idealo”).
Services of the Websites
The websites are aimed at end consumers (hereinafter also referred to as “customers”) who purchase, apply for or inform themselves (or each other) about products and/or services online via the Internet. On the websites, customers receive free price overviews and references to the sources of supply of products and services that are offered online by retailers, suppliers and service providers registered with idealo, as well as third parties (including white label cooperation partners) (hereinafter also referred to as “Online Shops”).
The information provided on the websites does not represent any legally binding offer on the part of idealo. The information research is widely automated and based to a great extent on information that idealo receives from the Online Shops and third parties (e.g. manufacturers and media). Data from the Online Shops and third parties is repeatedly updated via automatic processes throughout the day. In individual cases, discrepancies may occur, especially in regard to the prices (which also affects the ranking of the offers), the availability and the delivery times of products and services. Due to the sheer quantity of information to be processed, errors cannot entirely be ruled out, especially in cases where the incorrect information can be attributed to the Online Shops or other third parties. Therefore, idealo cannot assume any liability for the accuracy or inaccuracy of the information provided. This shall not apply if idealo is informed about the inaccuracy of the information, through a customer, for instance, and does not correct it or at least take action to have the Online Shop or third party correct it.
idealo hereby expressly emphasises that not all online shops and offers existing on the market are taken into account on the websites. The available selection remains the sole discretion of idealo and the Online Shops. The comparison results serve to provide an overview of the Online Shops cooperating with idealo and make no claims of displaying a complete overview. idealo reserves the right to remove individual products and services from the websites without prior notice to the customers.
By using idealo's websites customers agree to undertake and confirm that their use of the websites shall be governed by the following binding principles:
Customers shall not host, display, upload, modify, publish, transmit, update or share any information which:
belongs to another person and for which you do not have any right;
is grossly harmful, harassing, blasphemous, defamatory, obscene, pornographic, paedophilic, libellous, invasive of another's privacy, hateful, racially or ethnically objectionable, disparaging, relating or encouraging money laundering or gambling, or otherwise unlawful in any manner whatsoever; or unlawfully threatening or unlawfully harassing, including but not limited to "indecent representation of women" within the scope of the Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act, 1986;
harms minors in any way;
infringes any patent, trademark, copyright or other proprietary rights;
violates any law in force at the time of hosting, displaying, uploading, modifying, publishing, transmitting, updating or sharing;
deceives or misleads the addressee about the origins of such a message or communicates any information which is grossly offensive or menacing in nature;
impersonates another person;
contains software viruses or any other computer code, files or programs designed to interrupt, destroy or limit the functionality of any computer resource;
threatens the unity, integrity, defence, security or sovereignty of India, India's friendly relations with foreign states, or public order or causes incitement to the commission of any recognisable offence or prevents investigation of any offence or is insulting to any other nation.
Contractual Relationships
idealo does not become party to any purchase, service or other contract of any nature made in the course of acquiring the products or services represented on the websites. Contracts involving the acquisition of products or services represented on the websites are concluded exclusively between the customers and the Online Shops. In the case of such contracts, the respective terms and conditions (including cancellation policies) of the individual Online Shops apply. When the customer is interested in a product or service, the customer is generally taken via a link directly from idealo's websites to the web page of the Online Shop from which the offer in question originates. Before concluding a contract or a purchase, users themselves are responsible for checking whether the relevant data provided by the respective Online Shop is accurate and up to date.
On occasions, and only when labelled, a customer's contract offer for certain products listed on the websites may occur directly and without the customer being taken to the web pages of the Online Shop. In such cases idealo neither represents one of the contracting parties nor becomes party to any potential contract concluded between the customer and the Online Shop. All contract obligations are agreed solely between the customer and the Online Shop. Legal warranty rights apply to all product purchases and furthermore, the respective terms and conditions (including cancellation policies) of the Online Shop may apply to these contracts and/or the terms and conditions of the payment service provider. idealo assumes no responsibility as to whether the products and services displayed on the websites can actually be ordered or purchased from the Online Shop in question according to the declared terms and conditions.
All brand names, logos and/or other product designations on the websites are registered and protected trademarks or trade names of the respective owners.
User Contributions
Customers can express opinions concerning Online Shops, products and services (hereinafter “Services”) with text or image contributions and ratings directly on the websites. Participation is not legally enforceable and cannot be required or demanded. idealo reserves the right not to publish customer contributions.
A customer may only submit a review or rating if he/she has used the Service in question and is neither the Owner of the Service, nor being commissioned or compensated by the Service to do so. idealo expressly distances itself from third party reviews on the websites and is not liable for them. Services reviewed may express objections to these reviews by submitting their justification along with any supporting evidence to ****. After receiving an objection, idealo shall promptly investigate the review and, when applicable, remove the review or request that the customer make changes thereto.
With the submission of reviews and images, the user grants idealo the simple, gratuitous, revocable, spatially and temporally unlimited right to use the submitted content and the accompanying rating (including the right to modify this content, as long as the editing and modification of this content remain true to the original spirit of the work, and the right to translate it into other languages). The submitter of the content waives the right to be named or otherwise identified as author. The usage rights hereby granted are restricted in their content and scope to what is necessary for the operation, provision and improvement of services at idealo.
Indemnification regarding Customer Contributions
The customer will indemnify idealo against any and all claims by third parties brought against idealo due to alleged damaged incurred through the publication of the customer's text or image contributions on the websites. The customer will bear the costs of the necessary legal defence (in particular court and lawyers' fees) that idealo incurs through a legal assertion of claims. This does not apply when the customer is not liable for the legal violation.
Liability
The following exclusions and limitations apply with regard to idealo's liability, notwithstanding other legal claim requirements: idealo assumes liability if the cause of damage is the result of wilful misconduct or gross negligence on the part of idealo. In the case of simple negligence, idealo only assumes liability for the breach of significant duties, the proper fulfilment of which constitutes a condition sine qua non and on the fulfilment of which the customer regularly relies (so-called cardinal duties). In all other respects, liability for compensation for damage of any kind, regardless of the basis for claim, including liability for violation of mutual confidence in the preparation of contract, are excluded. If idealo assumes liability for an instance of simple negligence, this liability is limited to the damage that the occurrence of which could typically be expected due to circumstances known upon conclusion of the contract. The aforementioned exclusions and limitations of liability do not apply in cases of mandatory legal liability, in particular pursuant to the German Product Liability Act, in the event of the assumption of a guarantee, as well as for culpable injury to life, body or health.
The aforementioned exclusion and restrictions of liability also apply to employees, auxiliary persons and other third parties, serving idealo in the capacity of fulfilment of contract.
idealo assumes no liability and makes no guarantee as to the type, completeness and quality of the products, services or information from the Online Shops and/or other third parties, accessible either directly on the websites or indirectly, via links for instance. In particular, idealo assumes no liability and makes no guarantee as to the proper functioning and compatibility of systems, programs, etc., that are not directly part of idealo's services and over which, therefore, idealo has no influence. As such, idealo cannot assume liability for the accessibility and availability, the graphics, content or other technical design, structure or functionality of the websites of the Online Shops or third parties or for the products, services or information these third-party websites offer or do not offer.
Intellectual Property Rights
The websites contain data, search results, texts, graphics, software and other information that are protected under intellectual property right provisions, in particular copyright law and trademark law for the benefit of idealo and its employees. Reproduction, public distribution, modification and other encroachments on these rights, whether entirely or in part, are only permitted with the explicit written permission of idealo, unless a statutory limit applies. Each unauthorised encroachment represents a violation of these Terms and Conditions and will be prosecuted. In particular, the automated reading of databases and websites (e.g. via scraping) and the integration of the contents of the websites in a frame without idealo's permission is not permitted. The user is solely permitted to use the application for the individual comparison of offers from Online Shops for his/her own private needs. On the websites, idealo uses data that comes from the databases of the projects Geonames (www.geonames.org) and Dbpedia (www.dbpedia.org), as well as OpenStreetMap (www.openstreetmap.org), licensed under the CC-BY-SA 3.0- or the latter under the OdbL-, as well as the CC-BY-SA 2.0-.
Validity of Indian Law
The use of the websites and these General Terms and Conditions are governed solely by the laws of India.
Place of Jurisdiction and Severability Clause
If the customer is a registered merchant or trader, a legal entity under public law or a special fund constituted as a public law entity, the place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising from the contractual relationship between the customer and idealo is idealo's registered office.
If certain provisions of these General Terms and Conditions are or become partially or wholly invalid or ineffective, this shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions. Any unincorporated or ineffective General Terms and Conditions are replaced by statutory law. Furthermore, the parties undertake to replace the invalid or ineffective provision with an effective provision that comes as close as possible to fulfilling the economic intent and purpose of the invalid provision, as far as a supplemental interpretation is not possible or does not take priority.

Email: ****
In the following we provide you with comprehensive information about the purpose for which and scope within which we process your personal data during the use of the idealo websites.
2. Collection and processing of personal data
You can generally use the idealo websites – for which no payment or registration is required – without providing personal data. In certain cases, we will collect the personal data listed in Section 3. This fundamentally only occurs where necessary for the provision of a functional website or app, or for our content and services. We furthermore process personal data in connection with the use of idealo where you provide this data voluntarily, e.g. in the context of registration, a competition, an enquiry sent to us, or because there is another legal basis for this (see Section 4).
3. Categories of data processed
As soon as you visit flights.idealo.in or use one of the apps, our system automatically collects certain technical information. This can include:
Information about the browser type and version used
Operating system of the device from which the request originates
Mobile device ID
Date and time of access
Web analysis data / pseudonymised user profile (cookie ID, ad ID etc., see below for more information)
Websites from which the user got to our website
Websites accessed by the user from our website
Furthermore, we process the following personal data where a contractual relationship exists between you and us, or where you have communicated the data to us in another manner:
Personal master data (name, address, date of birth)
Communication data (telephone number, email address)
Contract master data (contractual relationship, product or contract interest, order history)
Login data with password
Invoicing and payment data
Comments, submissions etc.
4. Reason, content and purposes of processing: The idealo websites and services in general
We always process your data on the basis of one or more legal permissions or with your consent.
a. Submission of evaluations and comments
Personal data are collected by idealo when you as a customer submit your evaluation of a product, service, service provider or dealer (also referred to in the following as “online shop”), or participate in a survey. In this context, idealo collects the data specified in the respective form and the IP address assigned to the device used by you at the relevant point in time.
Information about you will only be published on the affected idealo websites where this is marked in the field of the form. In the case of opinions about online shops, these will additionally be shared with the customer or order number specified by you; this is an integral part of our evaluation and comment function, because only then can the online shop gain the opportunity to take notice of your comments or evaluations. We collect and process the data you provide in order to be able to publish your evaluation or comment as desired (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b GDPR). In particular, we also require your email address, in order to contact you in the event of complaints and give you the opportunity to respond (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. c GDPR).
b. Shopping and direct booking function
Based on Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR, we additionally collect personal data when you as a customer submit a contractual offer for certain products listed on the idealo websites directly and without forwarding to the websites of the online shops offering these products (the “shopping function” and “direct booking function”). idealo collects these data in order to initiate the contract and the handling of your order or booking, and for invoicing the respective online shop for our own mediation service.
idealo transmits these personal data to the respective online shop, where this is required for the conclusion and handling of your contract. Where idealo and/or the online shop utilises the services of third parties as service providers for the performance and handling of the contract or the service booked, e.g. for the performance of the booking, the handling of payment or the shipping of goods (referred to in the following as “service providers”), the required data will only be shared with these third parties for purposes of the fulfilment and handling of your order. Within the framework of handling your order or booking, you will also receive emails at the email address you provided from the respective online shop (e.g. order or booking confirmation) and possibly also from service providers (e.g. payment confirmation or information on the shipping process).
c. Forms, comparison calculator and payment services for the shopping and direct booking function
Unless otherwise indicated, it is idealo itself that collects your data that you enter in the respective contact forms. Please note that data transmission via the internet may be unsecured, and that data may therefore be intercepted or even falsified by unauthorised parties.
When you enter data in contact forms, we will only use the data for the purpose of conducting the communication with you and/or to provide the service you request; this constitutes our legitimate interest. The processing takes place on the basis of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR.
idealo sometimes integrates original content from partners in comparison services and for payment services for the shopping and direct booking function. In this case, the data that you enter are collected not by us but by the respective partner. The partners are named on the respective idealo websites. The partners have confirmed to us that they will handle your data in compliance with data protection requirements. Nevertheless, idealo has no influence over the collection, processing and use of your data by the partners. For information on whether and in what scope the partners collect your personal data, and what they use them for, please read the privacy policy of the respective partner, which can be accessed from the corresponding idealo website or the content of the partner. In particular, your credit card data will be processed and forwarded to the payment service providers of the partner, not by idealo itself, but by a company contracted by us and specialising in card security.
d. E-Mails and Newsletter
We use your e-mail address to send you our newsletter, if you subscribed and consented to the receipt of it potentially including advertisements. In this case we process your e-mail address to be able to deliver the newsletter as requested (Art 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR). You may object to the use of your e-mail address for such purposes at any time in writing or via e-mail (unsubscribe@idealo.co.uk) effective for the future, without resulting in any costs other than the transmission costs according to basic tariffs.
For our newsletters, we also select the content partly based on your prior use of the idealo pages and your expressed interests in products and content, so that we can tailor the respective newsletter to you and your interests. For example, if you looked for sporting goods on the idealo pages in the past, we would rather present you sporting goods in our newsletter than other product groups. For this purpose, we also process data that we collected using our cookies (for these cookies, see paragraph 9 c. below), and link them to your e-mail address. The legal basis for this data processing and the display of content relevant to you is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR, however you can object to the data processing at any time (see section 16 a).
e. IP addresses
On the internet, every device needs a clear address in order to transmit data, known as its IP address. It is a technical requirement for the IP address to be saved, at least temporarily, in order to facilitate the delivery of the internet page and app content to the device of the user.
aa) Log files
For security purposes, our servers save the IP address in what are known as log files for 14 days, e.g. in order to determine what happens if an attack (DoS) is made on idealo websites, or if illegal analysis of our databases occurs. This is based on Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR.
bb) Geolocalisation etc.
Before any further or other processing, we abbreviate the IP addresses before each processing step and then process them in an anonymised state. Unabbreviated IP addresses are not saved or processed further.
The processing of the (thus abbreviated) IP addresses allows us to display content with regional relevance on all idealo websites that are accessed from within a certain region. This is known as geolocalisation, i.e. assigning an instance of website access to the location from which it is accessed, and takes place exclusively on the basis of anonymised IP addresses, and only to the geographical level of German federal states / regions. Based on the geographical information thus obtained, it is never possible to determine the specific location of a user.
5. Occasion, content and purposes of processing: My favourites and price alert
idealo also offers you the following functionalities:
a. My favourites
You can “save” idealo products and journey components (e.g. flights and hotels), and these are then available to you on your “My favourites”. You are identified as the owner of your “My favourites” list by cookies that are used. The “My favourites” list allows you to compare products with one another in terms of their characteristics, and to access the price alarm function. The “My favourites” list is additionally filled by idealo with any products for which you have not completed the purchase using the “shopping function” from idealo. Based on your “My favourites” list entries, you will receive product recommendations via email, for example if the prices of the products you have saved change.
The legal basis here is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b GDPR.
b. Price alert
You have the option of setting up a price alarm for products, e.g. if you wish to purchase them for a cheaper price. You then enter your respective target price using the price alarm function. When you use the price alarm, idealo saves your products and target prices together with your email address, so that we can inform you in the event of price changes. At the same time, the local storage of your browser saves a value (“true” or “false”), which helps us to decide whether to offer you utilisation suggestions for the price alarm (as a pop-up). You can find an overview of the saved price alarms in your customer account. The legal basis here for processing is also Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b GDPR.
6. Location of processing
We ourselves do not transfer your personal data to countries outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"), except in cases where it is permitted under the GDPR. Whether third parties, with whom you have your own contractual relationship (such as with Facebook, if you have a Facebook account) transfer data to countries outside the EEA, is beyond our knowledge and influence.
Some of our contractual partners also process data in countries outside the EEA. In order to ensure the protection of your personal rights also in the context of these data transfers, we use the standard contractual clauses of the EU Commission in structuring the contractual relationships with the recipients in third countries in accordance with Art. 46 para. 2 lit. c GDPR.
For the US, the European Commission decided on 12th July 2016, that under the regulations of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shields an appropriate level of data protection exists (adequacy decision, Art. 45 GDPR). Further information - including the certification of the service providers we use - is available at https://www.privacyshield.gov. We only use US service providers who are certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield.
7. Origin of data
In certain cases, we also receive data because you have consented to them being transmitted to us.
As you know, apps are regularly made available to download by third-party providers (e.g. iTunes, Google etc.). If under the applicable terms and conditions of use of such a provider idealo Internet GmbH becomes your contractual partner for the purchase of the app, we process the data that the third-party provider makes available, in whatever scope is necessary for the fulfilment of contract, so that you can download the app to your mobile device.
8. Disclosure of your data to third parties
We will only disclose your personal data to third parties where this is necessary in order to fulfil our legal obligations to you, and where this is visibly done by or together with another provider (e.g. in the case of cooperation agreements), where we are otherwise legally entitled or obliged to disclose the data, or where you have provided us with corresponding consent.
In certain cases, we also use external service providers or affiliated companies, which we have contracted to process data for us, and which are bound by instructions. Such service providers are contractually bound by us as data processors in accordance with the strict provisions of the GDPR, and are not permitted to use your data for any further purposes. Data processors used by us perform in particular the following services: data centre, newsletter distribution and web/app analysis.
This disclosure of data to data processors takes place on the basis of Art. 28 Para. 1 GDPR, or alternatively on the basis of our legitimate interest in the economic and technical benefits associated with the use of specialised data processors, Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR.
Where we are legally obliged to do so, or where this is permitted under data protection law, we disclose personal data to public authorities, e.g. to police or the state prosecutor’s office (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. c GDPR). The disclosure of this data takes place on the basis of our legitimate interest in combating abuse, the prosecution of crimes, and in safeguarding, asserting and enforcing claims, which are not considered to be outweighed by your rights and interests in the protection of your personal data, Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR.
9. Cookies and other technologies
a. General
In order to ensure the full functionality of the idealo websites, idealo and the third parties named below save to your device files that serve amongst other things for collecting information regarding the use of a website or app, as well as additional data such as the IP address of the accessing computer and information about the software used (see above).
This typically involves the use of what are known as cookies. Cookies are small files that your browser saves on your device in a folder created for this purpose. These allow it to be determined, for example, whether you have ever visited a website before. If you have decided to stay logged into your customer account despite leaving the idealo websites, cookies can also be used to save your login data e.g. for the customer account, so that you do not need to enter these data every time you access the site.
Many cookies contain what is known as a cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique code identifying the cookie. It consists of a sequence of characters that allow websites and servers to be mapped to the specific internet browser in which the cookie has been saved. This enables the websites visited to differentiate the individual browser of the data subject from other internet browsers that contain different cookies. This data is not collated with other data sources.
The use of cookies can also take place using what are known as web beacons (also called ClearGIFs or tracking pixels). These are small graphics (e.g. in emails and on websites) that are inserted in order to achieve a better understanding of the interaction between the visitor and the website.
We use different types of cookies: On the one hand, we use technical cookies, without which the functionality of the idealo websites would be restricted, and on the other hand we use optional (see below) analysis and marketing cookies in order to make our services more user friendly. The analysis cookies are used for the purpose of improving the quality of both our content and yours. The analysis cookies tell us how idealo is used, thus allowing us to continuously improve our services. Further information on the individual analysis cookies and services can be found in Section 10 of this privacy policy.
You can prevent us from using cookies at any time by adjusting the corresponding setting in your internet browser, and thus permanently opt out. Furthermore, you can delete existing cookies at any time using your internet browser or other software programs. This is possible in all conventional internet browsers. If you deactivate cookies in the internet browser you use, you may not be able to make full use of all the functions of our website. In addition, you have the opportunity to object to analysis cookies and services (i.e. you can opt out; see Sections 10 and 11).
When using apps, a functionally comparable technology is used instead of cookies.
Cookies cannot identify you personally. In all cases, the use of cookies is justified on the basis of our legitimate interest in needs-oriented design, as well as for statistical analysis by idealo (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR).
b. Web storage (session storage and local storage)
idealo utilises web storage technology, a method for saving application data in your browser on your device, where your browser supports this technology and you have activated JavaScript. Web storage serves for optimising our website and our services. We use this technology for saving application data during the use of the idealo websites, e.g. in order to make navigation when searching for products or services more convenient, and to provide the “Recently viewed” function. Web storage provides two data objects, the session storage and the local storage. The entries in session storage are removed automatically after the browser or app is closed. You can delete the entries in local storage (“Recently viewed”) at any time by deleting the history in your browser. The session storage saves information in order to recognise your browser or device immediately, and thus provide you with easier access to our services. You can prevent the use of web storage by changing the corresponding setting in your browser, which may restrict the functionality of the idealo websites. The processing of data in web storage takes place on the basis of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in the purposes of processing described above.
c. idealo cookies
Cookies created by idealo allow the collection of information regarding browser type/version, resolution, previous/new display variant, URL clickstream (order of the pages of our website that you have visited previously), time of visit(s) to the websites, the reference in the idealo database for the products/services noted in your “My favourites”, and the cookie number, but not personal details such as name, address or email address. We use these cookies for purposes of advertising, market research and where required for the needs-oriented design of our services. The cookies of idealo are valid for a maximum of two years, unless you delete them sooner. The processing of data is justified in this case by Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR, however you may object to this processing with effect for the future by clicking here. The subsequently set opt-out cookie and your objection remain valid as long as you do not delete your browser cookies.
10. Web/app analysis services
In order to continuously improve our content and adapt it to the interests of our users, and to display online advertising, we use a number of services that collect data on our website and in the app, and which analyse these data for us. Where these service providers are not themselves the data controller in the meaning of data protection legislation, they are always bound by instructions when processing the pseudonymised user data on the basis of a data processing agreement. The legal basis for this processing is always Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR. You can deactivate the use of cookies by third-party providers, e.g. by accessing the deactivation page http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/ or http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices and acting on the information provided there on opting out. Not all access to the idealo pages is carried out via a web browser. In cases where users access using a mobile device, disabling cookies or changing web browser settings may not be possible. In the following, you can find details of the analysis services we use:
a. Adjust
We make use of the usage evaluation and analysis technology Adjust, produced by adjust GmbH, Saarbrücker Str. 36, 10405 Berlin. The Adjust service has been audited and certified under the ePrivacyseal (European Seal for your Privacy) (see https://www.eprivacy.eu/en/customers/awarded-seals/). Adjust collects installation and event data, and makes it available in the form of anonymised evaluations and graphics regarding the number of visits, number of pages accessed or apps opened per user etc. We use this information exclusively for purposes of our own market research, and for the optimisation and needs-oriented design of the website and app. For such an analysis, Adjust uses your anonymised IDFA or Android ID and your anonymised IP and MAC address. It is not possible to identify you personally. You can prevent any corresponding analysis in future at https://www.adjust.com/opt-out/.
b. Ad Up
Our websites use integrated tracking from Ad Up, a technology and service provider from Axel Springer Teaser Ad GmbH (Axel-Springer-Straße 65, 10969 Berlin). By collecting anonymised and/or pseudonymised data, Ad Up can then allow advertising related to your interests to be shown on websites for a certain time. Ad Up uses cookies in order to offer advertisers what is known as conversion tracking, which determines the effectiveness of their advertisements and keywords. More information on data protection at Axel Springer Teaser Ad GmbH can be found at https://www.adup-tech.com/en/privacy/. By using the “Activate opt-out cookie” button there, you have the option of saving an opt-out cookie to your browser, and thus to deactivate Ad Up in this browser.
c. affilinet
We have integrated components from the company affilinet on this website. Affilinet is a German affiliate network that provides affiliate marketing. Affiliate marketing is an internet-based form of sales that allows the commercial operators of websites, known as merchants or advertisers, to show advertisements on the websites of third parties, i.e. of sales parties, also known as affiliates or partners, and which are typically paid for on a per-click or per-sale commission basis. The merchant provides advertisement material via the affiliate network, i.e. an advertising banner or other suitable means of online advertising, which is subsequently integrated by affiliates into their own websites or advertised using other channels, e.g. keyword advertising or email marketing. The operating company of Affilinet is affilinet GmbH, Sapporobogen 6-8, 80637 Munich, Germany. Affilinet saves a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. What cookies are has already been explained above. The tracking cookie from Affilinet does not save any personal data.

e. AWIN
We have integrated components of AWIN on this website. AWIN is a German affiliate network that provides affiliate marketing. Affiliate marketing is an internet-based form of sales that allows the commercial operators of websites, known as merchants or advertisers, to show advertisements on the websites of third parties, i.e. of sales parties, also known as affiliates or partners, and which are typically paid for on a per-click or per-sale commission basis. The merchant provides an advertisement via the affiliate network, i.e. an advertising banner or other suitable means of online advertising, which is subsequently integrated by affiliates into their own websites or advertised using other channels, e.g. keyword advertising or email marketing. The operating company of AWIN is AWIN AG, Stralauer Allee 2, 10245 Berlin, Germany. AWIN saves a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject.

f. Bing
This website uses Bing Ads Universal Event Tracking, a conversion tracking service provided by Microsoft (Microsoft Corporation, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399, USA). This service allows us to track your activities on our website, if you got to our website via a Bing advertisement. This is possible because when you click on a Microsoft Bing Ads advertisement, a cookie (a small text file) is saved on your device. This tells Microsoft and us in particular the total number of users that have clicked on an advertisement and reached a predefined target page. These data are saved by Microsoft for 180 days. No personal information on the identity of the user are transmitted. If you do not wish to participate in Universal Event Tracking, you can reject the saving of cookies, e.g. in your browser settings. In addition, it is possible to deactivate interest-related advertising from Microsoft by opting out using the following link: https://account.microsoft.com/privacy/ad-settings/signedout?lang=en-GB Alternatively, the following website allows you to reject interest-related advertising from Microsoft and also other participating companies altogether: http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices Further information on the usage and data protection guidelines for this product can be found here: https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-GB/privacystatement If you do not want your data to be recorded via Bing, please click here. The subsequently set opt-out cookie and your objection remain valid as long as you do not delete your browser cookies.
g. Crashlytics
Crashlytics is an analysis tool that is provided and operated by Crashlytics Inc., which is registered in Cambridge MA, USA. Crashlytics generates what are known as crash reports, i.e. reports on glitches and crashes in the app, where and in what context these occurred, how many users of the app are affected, etc. We use these reports in order to learn from glitches and crashes, to react faster, more precisely and more efficiently in the interests of our users, and to make corresponding technical improvements to the app. To this end, Crashlytics records not only your Symphony-related app ID, which you can delete at any time, but also data on the “crash” and general data relating to the respective IT environment (in particular the device used, the mobile provider and the operating system). Where this contains personal or pseudonymised data, these are deleted by Crashlytics after seven days at the latest. With this information, Crashlytics and subsequently we learn how and why the app functions and is used, in particular including the glitches and crashes that occur. Further information is available under https://try.crashlytics.com/terms/privacy-policy.pdf. You can implement an opt-out as follows a) in iOS: select “Settings” > "Data Protection" > and switch off “Send Error Reports” b) in Android: open the idealo App, go to “Settings” > “Data Protection” and switch off “Send Error Reports”.
h. Criteo
The websites operated by idealo publish advertising from third parties, which is provided by Criteo SA, 32 Rue Blanche, 75009 Paris, France. This service serves to draw our users’ attention to further content whose subject matter is related to the content read by the respective user. The content and technical aspects of the content displayed is controlled and delivered by Criteo. Where the user has not opted out (see below), the selection of advertising displayed will also be made based on the content that the user is currently viewing and has recently viewed on the affected website. According to its own statements, Criteo only collects anonymised data. idealo likewise uses Criteo to publish advertising on the websites of third parties and in emails from third parties (https://emailprivacy.criteo.com/de/index.html) in order to address former customers of idealo. In this process the identity of the customer is not identified, and the customer is only recognised in pseudonymised form. This takes place using various devices of the customer, using an encrypted (undecryptable) email address. The cookies are stored for 180 days. Further information: https://support.criteo.com/hc/en-us/articles/202427141-Cross-Device-Integration Criteo provides information about the collection and utilisation of usage data and other data as the data controller in its own privacy policy https://www.criteo.com/privacy/. There you also have the option of objecting to the use of usage data and other data for certain purposes (your preference - “Opt out”). Advertising will then no longer be controlled based on the usage data collected by Criteo. You may object to this processing with effect for the future by clicking here. The subsequently set opt-out cookie and your objection remain valid as long as you do not delete your browser cookies.
i. Exact Target (Newsletter success measurement, conversion tracking)
Idealo utilises the ExactTarget email service from the company salesforce.com, inc., Landmark @ One Market, Suite 300, San Francisco, 94105, USA. (“ExactTarget”). Where users have consented to receive emails from idealo and visit the website via these emails, cookies and web beacons will be used in order to make the success of the newsletters transparent, e.g. whether it was opened and which topic was particularly relevant. Web beacons (also known as ClearGIFs or tracking pixels) are small graphics in the email and on the website, which are inserted in order to achieve a better understanding of the interaction between the visitor and the website. Web beacons function on the website together with cookies. Users can therefore stop the use of web beacons by preventing the installation of the cookies through the browser settings. If users do not wish to receive emails with web beacons, they can also switch emails into text format instead of HTML format. You may object to the processing of data with effect for the future by clicking here. The subsequently set opt-out cookie and your objection remain valid as long as you do not delete your browser cookies.
j. ExactTarget (adjustment for users)
Idealo uses the service “Predictive Intelligence” from ExactTarget in order to track the success of the emails, websites and apps from idealo, and to optimise these for the users. Personal data are not transmitted to ExactTarget; instead only pseudonyms are created. You may object to this processing with effect for the future by clicking here. The subsequently set opt-out cookie and your objection remain valid as long as you do not delete your browser cookies.
k. Facebook conversion pixel
We use the “conversion pixel” or visitor activity pixel of Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA (“Facebook”). By accessing this pixel from your browser, Facebook can subsequently recognise whether a Facebook advertisement was successful, e.g. whether it resulted in the conclusion of an online purchase. In relation to this we receive exclusively statistical data from Facebook, without reference to any specific person. This allows us to record the effectiveness of Facebook advertisements for statistical and market research purposes. In particular if you are signed into Facebook, we otherwise refer to their privacy policy https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/. You may object to this processing of data with effect for the future by clicking here. The subsequently set opt-out cookie and your objection remain valid as long as you do not delete your browser cookies.
l. Facebook Website Custom Audiences
Within our website, we use the “Website Custom Audiences” pixel from the social network Facebook, 1601 South California Avenue, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA. This involves what are known as tracking pixels being integrated into our websites. When you visit our websites, the tracking pixel allows a direct connection to be created between your browser and the Facebook server. Facebook receives from your browser, amongst other things, the information that our website was accessed from your device. If you a are a Facebook user, Facebook can thus collate the visit to our websites with your user account. Please note that as the provider of the websites, we have no knowledge of the content of the data transmitted, or of how they are used by Facebook. We are only able to select which segments of Facebook users (such as age, interests) our advertising should be shown to. In the process, we use one of two functions of Custom Audiences, where none of the data sets, and in particular email addresses of our users are transmitted to Facebook – neither encrypted nor unencrypted. Further information on this can be found in the privacy policy of Facebook under https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/. Please click here if you do not wish data to be collected via Custom Audiences. The subsequently set opt-out cookie and your objection remain valid as long as you do not delete your browser cookies.
m. Google Products
aa) Google AdSSense
We have integrated Google AdSense on this website. Google AdSense is an online service that allows the mediation of advertising on third-party websites. Google AdSense is based on an algorithm that selects advertisements for third-party websites based on the content of the respective third-party website. Google AdSense permits interest-oriented targeting of internet users, which is implemented by generating individual user profiles. The operating company of the Google AdSense component is Alphabet Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA. The purpose of the Google AdSense component is the integration of advertisements into our website. Google AdSense saves a cookie to the information technology system of the data subject. What cookies are has already been explained above. Saving the cookie allows Alphabet Inc. to analyse the use of our website. Each time one of the individual pages of this website, which we operate and on which a Google AdSense component has been integrated, is retrieved, the internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject is automatically prompted by the respective Google AdSense component to send data to Alphabet Inc. for purposes of online advertising and the invoicing of commissions. Within the framework of this technical process, Alphabet Inc. receives knowledge of personal data, such as the IP address of the data subject, which is used by Alphabet Inc. amongst other things to understand the origin of the visitor and the clicks, and subsequently to facilitate commission invoicing. The data subject can prevent cookies from being used by our website at any time, as already described above, by adjusting the corresponding setting in the internet browser used, and thus permanently opt out. Such a setting in the internet browser would also prevent Alphabet Inc. from saving a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. Furthermore, you can delete any cookie saved by Alphabet Inc. at any time using your internet browser or other software programs. Google AdSense additionally uses what are known as tracking pixels. A tracking pixel is a miniature graphic that is embedded in websites in order to allow log file recording and log file analysis, which allows statistical analysis to be performed. Using the embedded tracking pixel, Alphabet Inc. can recognise when a website was opened by a data subject, and what links the data subject clicked. Tracking pixels are used amongst other things to analyse the visitor traffic of a website. Google AdSense sends personal data and information to Alphabet Inc. in the USA, which includes the IP address and is required for the recording and invoicing of the advertisements displayed. These personal data are saved and processed in the USA. Alphabet Inc. never discloses the personal data collected using this technical process to third parties. Google AdSense is explained in greater detail under this link https://www.google.com/intl/en/adsense/start/#/?modal_active=none. More information and options for the deactivation of this advertising placement can be found at https://adssettings.google.com/u/0/authenticated?hl=en (link “Ads setting”, then “Deactivate”).
bb) Google AdWords
We have integrated Google AdWords on this website. Google AdWords is an online advertising service that allows advertisers to place advertisements both in the search results of Google and in Google’s advertising network. Google AdWords allows an advertiser to predefine certain keywords, by means of which an advertisement is displayed in the search results of Google exclusively when the user of the search engine accesses search results related to the keyword. In the Google advertising network, the advertisements are distributed to thematically relevant websites using an automated algorithm and following the predefined keywords. The operating company of the services of Google AdWords is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA. The purpose of Google AdWords is to advertise our website by displaying interest-related advertising on the websites of third-party companies and in the search results of the Google search engine, as well as displaying third-party advertising on our website. If a data subject comes to our website via a Google advertisement, Google saves what is known as a conversion cookie to the information technology system of the data subject. What cookies are has already been explained above. A conversion cookie becomes invalid after thirty days, and is not used to identify the data subject. Until the conversion cookie expires, it is used to determine whether certain sub-pages, for example the shopping basket of an online shop system, are accessed on our website. The conversion cookie allows both us and Google to track whether a data subject that comes to our website via an AdWords advertisement generates sales, i.e. whether a purchase has been completed or aborted. The data and information collected using the conversion cookie are used by Google to prepare visitor statistics for our website. These in turn are used by us in order to determine the total number of users that are sent to us via AdWords advertisements, and thus to determine the success or failure of the respective AdWords advertisement, and to optimise our AdWords advertisements for the future. Neither our company nor any other advertising customers from Google AdWords receive information from Google that could allow the data subject to be identified. The conversion cookie saves personal information, for example the websites visited by the data subject. For each subsequent visit to our websites, personal data are sent to Google in the USA, including the IP address of the internet connection used by the data subject. These personal data are saved by Google in the USA. Google may disclose the personal data collected using this technical process to third parties. The data subject can prevent cookies from being used by our website at any time, as already described above, by adjusting the corresponding setting in the internet browser used, and thus permanently opt out. Such a setting in the internet browser would also prevent Google from saving a conversion cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. Furthermore, you can delete any cookie saved by Google AdWords at any time using your internet browser or other software programs. The data subject also has the option at any time of opting out of Google using interest-related advertising. To do this, the data subject must use each of their internet browsers to access the link https://www.google.com/settings/ads and then change the desired settings. Further information and the applicable privacy policy of Google can be accessed at https://www.google.de/intl/en/policies/privacy/. You can also deactivate or opt out of Google advertisements https://privacy.google.com/?hl=de#google-experience wholly or in part. You may also object to this processing of data with effect for the future by clicking here. The subsequently set opt-out cookie and your objection remain valid as long as you do not delete your browser cookies.
cc) Google Analytics
We have integrated Google Analytics (with anonymisation function). Google Analytics is a web analysis service. Web analysis is the recording, collection and evaluation of data regarding the behaviour of visitors to websites. A web analysis service collects data, amongst other things, about which website a data subject came to a website from (known as the referrer), which sub-pages of the website are accessed, or how often and for how long a sub-page was viewed. A web analysis is predominantly used for optimisation of a website and for the cost/benefit analysis of online advertising. The operating company of the Google Analytics component is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA. For the web analysis via Google Analytics we use the suffix "_gat._anonymizeIp". This suffix means that the IP address of the internet connection used by the data subject is abbreviated and anonymised by Google if the access to our websites originates in a member state of the European Union or from another signatory state to the Treaty on the European Economic Area. The purpose of the Google Analytics component is the analysis of visitor traffic on our website. Google uses the data and information obtained, amongst other things, in order to analyse the use of our website, in order to compile online reports for us identifying the activities on our websites, and in order to provide additional services relating to the use of our website. Google Analytics saves a cookie to the information technology system of the data subject. What cookies are has already been explained above. Saving the cookie allows Google to analyse the use of our website. Each time one of the individual pages of this website, which we operate and on which a Google Analytics component has been integrated, is retrieved, the internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject is automatically prompted by the respective Google Analytics component to send data to Google for purposes of online analysis. Within the framework of this technical process, Google receives knowledge of personal data, such as the IP address of the data subject, which is used by Google amongst other things to understand the origin of the visitor and the clicks, and subsequently to facilitate commission invoicing. The cookie allows personal information to be saved, such as the access time, the location from which the access originated, and the frequency of visits to our website by the data subject. For each visit to our websites, these personal data are sent to Google in the USA, including the IP address of the internet connection used by the data subject. These personal data are saved by Google in the USA. Google may disclose the personal data collected using this technical process to third parties. The data subject can prevent cookies from being used by our website at any time, as already described above, by adjusting the corresponding setting in the internet browser used, and thus permanently opt out. Such a setting in the internet browser would also prevent Google from saving a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. Furthermore, you can delete any cookie saved by Google Analytics at any time using your internet browser or other software programs. The data subject also has the option of opting out of, and thus preventing, the collection and processing by Google of data generated by Google Analytics in relation to the use of this website. To do this, the data subject needs to download and install a browser add-on from the link http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de. This browser add-on uses JavaScript to inform Google Analytics that it is not permitted to transmit data and information regarding visits to websites to Google Analytics. The installation of the browser add-on is treated by Google as an opt-out. If the information technology system of the data subject is subsequently deleted, formatted or reinstalled, the data subject must repeat the installation of the browser add-on in order to deactivate Google Analytics. If the browser add-on is uninstalled or deactivated by the data subject or by another person within their sphere of influence, it is possible to reinstall or reactivate the browser add-on. Further information and the applicable privacy policy of Google can be accessed at https://www.google.de/intl/en/policies/privacy/ and https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/gb.html Google Analytics is explained in greater detail under this link https://www.google.com/intl/de_de/analytics/. You may also object to this processing of data with effect for the future by clicking here. The subsequently set opt-out cookie and your objection remain valid as long as you do not delete your browser cookies.
dd) Google DoubleClick
We have integrated components of DoubleClick by Google on this website. DoubleClick is a brand owned by Google, under which predominantly online marketing solutions are marketed to advertising agencies and publishers. The operating company of DoubleClick by Google is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA. DoubleClick by Google transmits data to the DoubleClick server with every impression, as well as with clicks or other activities. Each of these transfers triggers a cookie request to the browser of the data subject. If the browser accepts this request, DoubleClick saves a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. What cookies are has already been explained above. The purpose of the cookies is to optimise and display advertising. The cookie is used amongst other things to identify and display advertising that is relevant to the user, and to prepare reports about advertising campaigns and improve such campaigns. The cookie is also used to prevent multiple versions of the same advertisement being displayed. DoubleClick uses a cookie ID which is necessary for the handling of the technical process. The cookie ID is required, for example, in order to display an advertisement in a browser. DoubleClick can additionally use the cookie ID to record which advertisements are already being displayed in a browser, in order to avoid displaying duplicates. The cookie ID also enables DoubleClick to record conversions. Conversions are recorded, for example, when a user was previously shown a DoubleClick advertisement, and then subsequently uses the same internet browser to complete a purchase on the website of the advertiser. A cookie from DoubleClick contains no personal data. A DoubleClick cookie can, however, contain additional campaign IDs. A campaign ID serves to identify the campaigns with which the user has already been in contact. Each time one of the individual pages of this website, which we operate and on which a DoubleClick component has been integrated, is retrieved, the internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject is automatically prompted by the respective DoubleClick component to send data to Google for purposes of online advertising and the invoicing of commissions. Within the framework of the technical process, Google receives knowledge of data that Google also uses for the creation of commission invoices. Google can determine, amongst other things, that the data subject has clicked certain links on our website. The data subject can prevent cookies from being used by our website at any time, as already described above, by adjusting the corresponding setting in the internet browser used, and thus permanently opting out. Such a setting in the internet browser would also prevent Google from saving a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. Furthermore, cookies already saved by Google can be deleted at any time using your internet browser or other software programs. Detailed information on opting out of cookies can be found here: Further information and the applicable privacy policy of DoubleClick by Google can be accessed at https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/.
ee) Google Dynamic Remarketing
On the website, we use the remarketing or “similar audiences” function of Google Inc. (“Google”). The operating company of the services of Google Remarketing is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA. This function allows the provider to target visitors to the website specifically, by displaying interest-related advertisements that are personalised for the visitors to the provider’s website, if they have visited other websites in the Google Display network. Google uses what are known as cookies to perform the analysis of the website use, which forms the basis for creating interest-related advertisements. To this end, Google saves a small file with a series of numbers in the browsers of visitors to the website. This number is used to record visits to the website and anonymised data about the use of the website. The personal data of visitors to the website is not saved. If you subsequently visit another website in the Google Display network, you will be shown advertisements that have a greater probability of relating to types of products and information that you have previously accessed. You can permanently deactivate the use of cookies by Google specifically by using the following link and then downloading and installing the plug-in: https://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin. The data subject also has the option at any time of opting out of Google using interest-related advertising. To do this, the data subject must use each of their internet browsers to access the link https://www.google.com/settings/ads/ and then change the desired settings. Alternatively, you can deactivate the use of cookies by third-party providers by accessing the deactivation page of the Network Advertising Initiative under  http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/ and following the information provided there on opting out. Further information on Google Remarketing and the privacy policy of Google can be viewed at: http://www.google.com/privacy/ads/.
ff) Google Firebase
We use Firebase. This is a real-time database that allows real-time information to be embedded in one’s own website, in order to better understand and optimise user behaviour in the apps. Furthermore, other functions of Firebase are also used that allow better user navigation or evaluation of what causes crashes in the apps. Firebase is a Google subsidiary and is headquartered in San Francisco (CA), USA. Further information can be found in the privacy policy of Firebase at https://www.firebase.com/terms/privacy-policy.html. You can implement an opt-out as follows a) in iOs: please select “Settings” > "idealo" > "Data Protection" > and switch off “Send User Data” b) in Android: open the idealo App, select “Settings” > “Data Protection” and switch off “Send User Data”.
gg) Google Tag Manager
idealo uses the Tag Manager from Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (“Google”). Tags are the IDs of data elements. Tracking pixels from the third-party providers named here are loaded on the websites. The Tag Manager tool itself (which implements the tags) is a cookie-free domain and does not record personal data. The tool ensures that other tags are triggered, which in turn may record data. However, Google Tag Manager does not access this data. Further information is available here: https://support.google.com/tagmanager/?hl=en and http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy
hh) Hotjar
idealo uses the analysis software “Hotjar” provided by Hotjar Ltd, St Julians Business Centre, 3, Elia Zammit Street, St Julians STJ 1000, Malta, to measure and evaluate user behaviour (mouse movements, clicks, scrolling position, etc.) on our websites. For this purpose, Hotjar uses cookies on the user’s devices to record non-personal user data, such as browser information, operating system, time spent on the website, etc. (only with an anonymised IP address).

ii) Ingenious Technologies
For some offers on idealo, a cookie of Ingenious Technologies AG, Französische Straße 48, 10117 Berlin, is activated when the link to online shop’s offer is clicked. These cookies are used to subsequently assign online shop sales to the respective offer on idealo and to invoice the online shop. Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR serves as the legal basis for using these cookies; in any case, idealo has a legitimate interest in tracking. Should you not wish for tracking to be used, you can prevent tracking by activating the “Do Not Track” function in your browser.
jj) Outbrain
We use the services of London-based Outbrain UK Limited. Outbrain UK Limited uses cookies to collect and process information about which websites your browser has visited, which advertising space has been clicked, how long a website has been visited, and about the general interaction with the website. In addition, Outbrain UK Limited collects information about the attractiveness of online advertising, such as the number of clicks and the resulting online sales that an advertisement generates. As a result, we can adapt the displayed online advertising to be more relevant to you. If you would like to deactivate the technology of Outbrain UK Limited for your browser, please click on the “Opt-Out” button on the following link:https://www.outbrain.com/legal/privacy#privacy-policy.

The subsequently set opt-out cookie and your objection remain valid as long as you do not delete your browser cookies.
kk) Remerge Retargeting
idealo uses the retargeting (remarketing) function of remerge GmbH (“remerge”). This function allows us to address visitors (users) to our app with personalised advertising when they visit our sites or third-party offers at a later point in time. For this purpose, information based on the user behaviour, e.g. which app content users have viewed or which advertisement they have clicked on, is stored in pseudonymised form. These pseudonymised usage profiles are never combined with users’ personal data and are only used to facilitate interest-based advertising. Users, who do not wish for remerge’s retargeting (remarketing) function to be used, can deactivate it by following the instructions provided under “Opt-out”: https://www.remerge.io/privacy-policy.html.

mm) Scalable central measurement next Generation (range measurement)
The website uses the measurement procedure (“SZMnG”) of INFOnline GmbH, Brühler Str. 9, 53119 Bonn, to determine statistical characteristic values about the use of this website. The purpose of the measurement survey is to determine the usage intensity, the number of users of a website and the surfing behaviour statistically – on the basis of a standardised standard procedure – and thus to obtain comparable values across the market. INFOnline GmbH collects and processes data in accordance with German data protection laws. Technical and organisational measures are used to ensure that individual users cannot be identified at any point in time. Data that can be associated with a particular, identifiable person are anonymised as soon as possible. The IP addresses are abbreviated before any data is processed. Data is only ever processed in anonymous form. Unabbreviated IP addresses are not stored or processed further. This is known as geolocalisation, i.e. assigning an instance of website access to the location from which it is accessed, and takes place exclusively on the basis of anonymised IP addresses, and only to the geographical level of German federal states/regions. Based on the geographical information thus obtained, it is never possible to draw conclusions about a user’s specific location.

A social network is a place for social meetings on the internet, an online community which usually allows users to communicate with each other and interact in a virtual space. A social network may serve as a platform for exchanging opinions and experiences, or enable the internet community to provide personal or business-related information. Facebook allows social network users to create private profiles, upload photos and socialise by making friend requests, amongst other things. Facebook’s operating company is Facebook, Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025, United States. If a data subject lives outside of the United States or Canada, the controller responsible for processing personal data is Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland. Each time one of the individual pages of this website – which we operate and on which a Facebook component (Facebook button) has been integrated – is accessed, the internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject is automatically prompted by the respective Facebook component to download a display of the corresponding Facebook component of Facebook. An overview of all Facebook plug-ins can be found at: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/?locale=de_DE. During the course of this technical procedure, Facebook gains knowledge of what specific subpage of our website was visited by the data subject.
