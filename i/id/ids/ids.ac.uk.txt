IDS is committed to protecting your privacy and complying with these regulations. This statement sets out how this is implemented across all of our communications channels, applications and networks, and details your rights in relation to your personal data that IDS captures, stores and uses. In addition to the above, we collect information automatically about visits to our website.

We do not use any automated decision-making systems except those used to detect and remove viruses from content you may provide us or undertake automated profiling. We do not record data which falls under the Sensitive/Special Category. IDS will never attempt to buy or sell your Personal Data.
Storage, use of personal information and data protection
Any personal data captured by IDS is used and held in accordance with the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 2018.  All IDS Staff are required to complete and pass an online data protection course which gives them knowledge on how to process personal data.
We will only disclose data when obliged to disclose personal data by law or we have your consent.

We will only share your personal information with third parties who process data on our behalf or where necessary, for example when your information needs to be provided to the financial institution that processes our credit card transactions. They receive your name, address, telephone number, credit card number and expiry date solely for the purpose of verifying the credit card number and processing the transaction in a secure environment. They employ industry standard security technology to ensure the confidentiality of your transactions.
Research Projects
IDS undertakes research projects with partners and organisations from around the world. From the 25 May 2018 all new research projects  are required to fill out a Data Protection Impact Assessment form (DPIA) which checks how personal data is managed in that project. Projects are also required to carry out Privacy Impact Assessments on actual activities that collect personal data.
Fundraising
IDS is a UK registered charity receiving no statutory funding and relying on independent fundraising efforts for much of its income. As such we may from time to time gather, or engage specialist agencies to gather, publicly available information about selected individuals to identify people who may have an affinity with our mission but with whom we have not yet had any contact.
This research helps us to understand more about individuals so we can focus the conversations we have with them about fundraising and volunteering in the most effective way and ensure we avoid communicating with people in an inappropriate way. If you would prefer us not to use your data in this way please email: dpo@ids.ac.uk to let us know.
We will also use publicly available sources of information to carry out due diligence on our donors in line with our Fundraising Ethics Policy and to meet money laundering regulations.
Internet-based transfers
Given that the Internet is a global environment, using it to collect and process personal data necessarily involves the transmission of data on an international basis. This means, for instance, that data you pass to us may be processed outside the European Economic Area, although the data will always be held securely and in line with the requirements of UK data protection legislation. By communicating electronically with us, you acknowledge and agree to our processing of personal data in this way.
Website
When people visit the IDS website, we log non-personally-identifiable information including IP address, profile information, aggregate user data, and browser type. We use this data to monitor usage and improve our website services.

Personal data you provide to IDS through these transactions will be used solely for the purpose of payment to this IDS short course. Your personal data collected and used for this online payment system will not be passed onto or shared with any other organisation. Only IDS Staff will have access to personal information that you send, but this will not be used for any other purposes apart from IDS short course administration.
Security:  You should protect personal data at all times throughout your online transaction and make sure you logoff properly when the transaction is complete. Only the last four digits of your credit/debit card numbers are stored in the database on successful payment. To protect the security of your information during transmission we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts the information you input to and from the site.
