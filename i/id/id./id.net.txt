Reminder: the websites are created and maintained by other businesses and developers who are not part of the Company, so it is important You make sure to read their terms of service and privacy policies.
(b) Logging in to another website using id.net
The Company lets You log into third party websites using id.net identities created on Your id.net account. This means that You have the possibility to use the default id.net identities or create new ones to log in to third party websites. You can determine under which identity You want to access third party websites. When You log in using id.net, Your id.net account information will never be transferred to the third party website without Your consent (Section II (c)). In order for third party websites to uniquely identify Your account among other accounts, We send a unique identifier named ‘PID’ (personal identification). Your PID is different for each third party website so as to preserver your anonymity.
Be aware that there is a probability that third party websites may require from You different information than the one in the fields you have chosen to fill for Your id.net identity. For instance, You may have filled in solely Your name and country but the third party website requires You to provide Your nickname as well. The extra information required may vary from one third party website to another. Once you do so, the extra information provided will be automatically added to the identity you have accessed that website with. As a result, all the websites linked to that identity will also benefit from that additional information. Nonetheless, You are able to view which third party website has access to which information You provided by going on the “Sites” section of Your id.net account.
If You already have an account on a third party website, that website may also be able to let You connect and link it to one of Your id.net identities. Your information will be sent to Us when You use Your id.net identity to register or login to a third party website.
(c) Privacy Practices of Third Parties
