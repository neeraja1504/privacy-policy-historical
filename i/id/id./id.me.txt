Version: 4.0.6
Last updated: 12/19/2016
This Privacy Policy discloses the privacy practices for the ID.me credentialing services (namely, ID.me’s services to eligible users who create an account with an electronic identification resource (or “ID.me Account”) and verify certain user criteria (such as legal name, address or membership in certain affinity group(s)) to access certain exclusive benefits). The Privacy Policy also covers the ID.me website located at www.ID.me, ID.me’s affiliated websites, the ID.me mobile application, and elements of ID.me’s technology platform (e.g., group affiliation widgets) present on ID.me client websites (collectively referred to hereafter as the “Website”). This Privacy Policy explains how ID.me collects, uses and discloses information you submit to or is collected via the Website and ID.me credentialing services.
ID.me, Inc., the provider of the ID.me’s credentialing services and Website (referred to as “us” or “we”), is committed to protecting the privacy of individuals who navigate to, or otherwise use the Service and/or Website (hereafter, “Users” or “you”). The ID.me’s credentialing services and Website are designed to offer eligible Users with ID.me Accounts to access certain exclusive benefits, including without limitation, deals, discounts, cash back rebates and employment and educational opportunities, offered by participating retailers, service providers, employers or benefits administrators (collectively, the “ID.me Service”). Users who create an ID.me Account are required to submit certain information to ID.me as part of the verification process so that we may ascertain the User’s identity, group affiliation, and determine other eligibility standards for the User tied to the ID.me Service. However, Users may choose what specific information (personally identifiable information and other forms of information as described in greater detail below) is tied to their ID.me Account and control how much of that information is shared with other websites in relation to the ID.me Service. In certain cases, the more information Users share the more rewards and benefits, such as deals, discounts, cash back rebates and employment and educational opportunities, the User may be eligible to receive, as further described in our Terms of Service. However, certain participating websites may require that Users provide certain, minimum levels of information and a User’s refusal to provide such may impact his or her eligibility for the subject good, service, or benefit offered.
To avoid any confusion, Users should understand that, while we own and operate the Service and Website and certain other websites, we do not own or operate websites owned and operated by third parties who may avail themselves of the ID.me Service (collectively referred to hereafter as the “Third Party Websites.”) This Privacy Policy is intended to inform Users about our collection, use, storage, and disclosure, destruction and disposal of information that we collect or record in the course of providing the Website and the ID.me Service. Please note, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of Third Party Websites and they are under no obligation to comply with this Privacy Policy. Before visiting Third Party Websites, and before providing the User’s ID.me or any other information to any party that operates or advertises on Third Party Websites, Users should review the privacy policy and practices of that website to determine how information collected from Users will be handled. Please further note, depending on a User’s particular interaction with us (e.g., Users who solely navigate the Website versus Users who create an account and use the ID.me Service at Third Party Websites), different portions of this policy may apply to Users at different times.
Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By accessing or using the Website or the ID.me Service in any form, you acknowledge that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound to all the terms of this Privacy Policy and the Website’s Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these terms, exit this page and do not access or use the Service or Website.

In addition, we reserve the right to audit your eligibility (e.g., group affiliations such as active duty military or student status); to audit user accounts for fraud by, for example, verifying that purchases are delivered to registered user addresses; and to prevent duplicate ID.me Account’s from being created with the same information.
In order to better serve members of America’s Armed Forces and other personnel covered by the Service Members Civil Relief Act (SCRA) (50 U.S.C. App. 501 et. seq.)*, ID.me provides services to financial services companies and Third Party Websites in order to facilitate their compliance with the provisions of SCRA. By joining ID.me, you agree that ID.me may use your Personally Identifiable Information in order to assist Financial Services companies and Third Party Websites to determine your eligibility or your family member’s eligibility for SCRA benefits and protections.

Non-Personally Identifiable Information
Non-Personally Identifiable Information is information that does not identify a specific User. This type of information may include things like the Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”) of the website you visited before coming to the Website, the URL of the website you visit after leaving the Website, the type of browser you are using, your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, occupation, language, unique device identifier, approximately geographic location, and time zone. We, and/or our authorized third party service providers and advertisers, may automatically collect this information when you visit our Website through the use of electronic tools like Cookies and Web beacons or Pixel tags or location based capabilities on your mobile device, including those described in Items 4 and 8 of this Privacy Policy. We use Non-Personally Identifiable Information to troubleshoot, administer the Website, analyze trends, gather demographic information, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities. We may also share this information with our authorized third party service providers and advertisers to measure the overall effectiveness of our online advertising, content, and programming. In certain limited instances, we may combine certain Non-Personally Identifiable Information with other identifiers in order to confirm your identity as part of the ID.me verification process. For example, we may combine an approximate geographic location obtained from a User’s mobile device and match it with address information the User voluntarily submitted to the Website in order to confirm the User’s identity and prevent fraudulent conduct. Notwithstanding, this information would still be considered Non-Personally Identifiable Information when it is taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying information (for example, the type of web browser used by the User).

We may use Third Party Advertising Companies to serve ads when you visit our Website. These companies may use Non-Personally Identifiable Information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide, through the use of network tags, advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you.

We use cookies to save you time while using the Website, remind us who you are, administer cash back rebates, and track and target user interests in order to provide a customized experience. Cookies also allow us to collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information from you, like which pages you visited and what links you clicked on.

Other Tracking Devices

Pixel tags and web beacons are tiny graphic images placed on certain pages on our Website, or in our emails that allow us to determine whether you have performed a specific action. When you access these pages or open or click an email, pixel tags and web beacons generate a Non-Personally Identifiable notice of that action. Pixel tags allow us to measure and improve our understanding of visitor traffic and behavior on our Website, as well as give us a way to measure our promotions and performance. We may also utilize pixel tags and web beacons provided by our Affiliates and/or Marketing Partners for the same purposes.
