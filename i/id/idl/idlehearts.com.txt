Privacy Policy - IdleHearts
We take your privacy very seriously.
Effective November 2011
IdleHearts provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive from when you use and visit www.idlehearts.com (this “Site”). This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide to us through the Site.
Information Collection and Use
Like most website operators, IdleHearts collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. IdleHearts purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how IdleHearts visitors use its website. From time to time, IdleHearts may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g. by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
IdleHearts also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. IdleHearts does not use such information to identify its visitors, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.
Gathering of Personally Identifiable Information
Certain visitors to IdleHearts website choose to interact with IdleHearts in ways that require IdleHearts to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that IdleHearts gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for idlehearts.com to provide a username and email address. In each case, IdleHearts collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with IdleHearts. IdleHearts does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
Aggregated Statistics
IdleHearts may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its website. For instance, IdleHearts may monitor the most popular posts and may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, IdleHearts does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
IdleHearts discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on IdleHearts behalf or to provide services available at IdleHearts website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using IdleHearts website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. In addition, in some cases we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if IdleHearts or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that IdleHearts goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of IdleHearts may continue to use your personal and non-personal information only as set forth in this policy. Otherwise, IdleHearts will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone.
Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, IdleHearts discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when IdleHearts believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of IdleHearts, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a IdleHearts website and have supplied your email address, IdleHearts may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with IdleHearts and its products. If you send us a request (for example via a support email), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. IdleHearts takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
You should also be aware that if you submit information to “chat rooms,” “forums” or “message boards” such information becomes public information, meaning that you lose any privacy rights you might have with regards to that information. Such disclosures may also increase your chances of receiving unwanted communications.
