How We Protect Your Data
The security and reliability of our service is our number one priority.
Prevention is best when it comes to security, and as a first step, we follow all Code Standards in the platforms that we build and use.
In addition, we have an extensive internal review and Quality Assurance process in place specifically to prevent potential security vulnerabilities in our platforms and services.
Every employee and contractor goes through background and onboarding process that includes a trial period where access to customer data is provided only when working directly under the supervision of another staff member.
All staff only have access to systems that are directly required to complete the functions of their job. We use dual factor authentication for all critical systems and communications services, and automatically log all staff activity using an internal logging tool, Google ÂG' Suite features, and Amazon Cloud Trail.
All staff (including any contractors) undergo initial training to ensure proper understanding of all security-related processes. Staff regularly attend industry conferences and otherwise stay informed of best practices and relevant trends. Staff review and agree, in writing, to all policies and procedures annually.
We only use third-party services, such as Amazon Web Services, that are fully vetted and adhere to the highest levels of privacy and security practices.
