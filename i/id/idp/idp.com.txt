IDP Global
Introduction
At IDP* we understand that your privacy is important to you. We are committed to meeting your expectations and will comply with all applicable privacy and data protection legislation in relation to your personal information and sensitive information.
We also know you love the small print, but here’s a summary of how we protect your privacy:
1. We only collect what we need to help you with your request or provide you with information that you ask for, personalising it to your interests.
2. We won’t hang on to your information. If we don’t need it, and you don’t want us to keep it, we’ll delete it.
3. We want you to understand everything we do with your information, so we’ll try our best to explain with no nonsense.
4. No surprises — you decide what and how you hear from us.
5. That goes for everyone. We do not pass your information to third parties for marketing purposes without your knowledge.
The rest of this policy provides you with more detail of our privacy and personal information handling practices.

Right to object
You can object to the processing of your personal data.
Right to not be subject to automated decisions and profiling

Right to data portability
If you have provided us with your personal data with consent or under the contact obligations, you have the right to request the data you have provided to us in a machine-readable format should you decide to move to another data controller.
