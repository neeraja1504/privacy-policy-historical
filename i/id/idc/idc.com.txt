Corporate Accounts
Corporate administrators ("Corporate Administrators") at our client organizations have access to usage statistics for their organization’s account base. If your user account, including Personal Data, is part of a corporate account, then a Corporate Administrator at your organization may access your user data containing Personal Data and usage information. Corporate Administrators can access user information only for individuals within their corporate profile.

Transfer of Information by IDC
In the event that part or all of the ownership of IDC, or any of its products are sold or transferred, all lists and data that contains Personal Data, will be transferred to the new owner.
