Accordingly, children under 13 years old may be restricted from participating in certain activities and transactions on the Great American Rivalry Series.
GARS and affiliates work with (and may provide links to) third party sites that offer features described on GreatAmeicanRivalry.com.

However, GARS and its affiliated companies do not knowingly obtain, retain or use information from anyone who indicates that they are under 13 years old.
Please read this Privacy Policy (“Policy”) for an explanation of how we will treat your personal information. By using the GARS website, you consent to the collection and use of personal information as outlined in this Policy. If you do not agree to this Policy, please do not use our site. If we make any material changes to the Policy, those changes will be posted here so that you are always aware of what personal information is collected, how that information is used, and under what circumstances that information may be disclosed. Since this Policy may change from time to time, you should check back periodically. If you have any questions or comments regarding this Policy, please contact the GARS office at 859-225-4488.
1. What personally identifiable information of yours or third party personally identifiable information is collected from you through the site
As stated above, GARS and its affiliates do not solicit any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13.  GARS and its affiliates do not collect personally identifiable information through the site unless you provide that information. Information that may be required for certain parts of the Web Site may vary but will typically include your first and last name; address including city, state, zip code and country; complete date of birth; and e-mail address; and, in the case of making purchases, a credit card number and expiration date. You may also be requested to provide a username and password for certain features. GARS will maintain all of the personal information submitted by you in secured servers behind corporate firewalls.
2. The organization collecting the information
GARS and its affiliated companies are located at 325 West Main Street, Lexington, KY 40507. Please contact the GARS Office at 859-225-4488.
3. How the information is used
GARS may use information provided at registration or information obtained through third parties as your intention to sign up for one of our contests or offers. The use of information provided at registration or obtained through third parties may also be provided to iHigh.com corporate sponsors if we have so notified you on our site. GARS uses “cookie” technology. Cookies are pieces of information transferred to your hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Such technology is an industry standard and is used by most major Web sites. GARS will never use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent in a cookie. In order to effectively use the site and some of its features, your browser must accept cookies.
Users should be aware that GARS and its affiliates cannot control the use of cookies or the resulting information by advertisers or third parties hosting data for GARS. If a user does not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows the user to deny or accept cookies; however, users should note that cookies may be necessary to provide the user with certain features available on GARS Web Sites.
GARS tracks certain general usage pattern information, including what pages people visit and how long they have been registered users. GARS may log users’ IP addresses (the group of four numbers separated by periods, such as 123.45.64.89, that identifies a particular host computer) for the purposes of system administration, site tracking and reporting of aggregate usage information to our marketing and product development teams.
From time to time, GARS may solicit your opinion to determine your preferences and dislikes in order to provide you with a better product. These surveys are always optional to the user and your decision not to participate in a survey will not affect your status as a GARS Web Site user. Should you choose to participate, any information you give us may be used in aggregate form for marketing purposes, and to enhance your overall experience on our site.
4. With whom the information may be shared
GARS will not provide any personally identifiable information about you to other third parties without your consent. GARS may, however, provide other third parties with anonymous aggregated information about our users to illustrate trends and patterns.
5. What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information
If you are to be sent further offers as part of a contest entry, you will be clearly notified (such as an SLFC contest or a voter poll). GARS will not share your information with any other parties other than those clearly listed when you give us your information. For instance, if SLFC sponsors a contest with GARS or its affiliates, only SLFC and GARS will collect your information. No other third parties will have access.
6. The kind of security procedures that are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under our control
GARS has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under its control. The servers for GARS are stored in a physically secure and climate controlled off-site facility. Beyond the physical protection of the servers, we protect against data loss by regularly backing up data, performing consistency checks with independently recorded log files to prevent tampering, and restricting access to information on our servers via several user authentication technologies. Only those employees needed to carry out the business functions will have access to information on individual GARS customers and users. We train each such employee with respect to the GARS Privacy Policy, and those violating these policies will be subject to disciplinary action.
It is important to remember that whatever you transmit or disclose online can be collected and used by others or unlawfully intercepted by third parties. No data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. While we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. In addition, we may disclose information to law enforcement or other government officials if we determine such disclosure to be appropriate, or if we are compelled to disclose it by court order or operation of law.
NOTE TO PARENTS
It is GARS policy not to solicit any personally identifiable information from children. All GARS online registrants will be required to enter their full name, age, zip code and e-mail address. If GARS determines that a person is under the age of 13, based on the information provided during the registration process, that person will not be permitted to register online for our contests or offers in accordance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998. Any personally identifiable information that the child may have attempted to enter during the registration process will not be collected or maintained by GARS. Children who indicate that they are under 13 years old will not be able to make credit card purchases or participate in interactive features on GARS that involve the collection and retention of personal information (e.g., entering a sweepstakes).
GARS works with (and may provide links to) third party sites that offer features described on GARS. Such third parties may permit children under the age of 13 to register for these features on their sites in accordance with their respective privacy policies.
