A panel of health providers is provided within the secure system for consultation. However the purpose of internet enabled healthcare platform is limited if USERS/MEMBERS are not allowed to explore the world wide web and seek 2nd opinon and advice outside the provider panel.
Therefore the USERS/MEMBERS can request us to add their preferred doctors and health providers to be included in the panel.
This enables the normal conversation between the USER/MEMBER and the health provider to remain within the SSL and is not exposed. The normal conversation is recorded and stored in the database.
The same is valid for chat conversations. However chat conversations can be stored or deleted as per client requirements.
