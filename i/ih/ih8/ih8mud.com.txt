Security
This website takes every precaution to protect our users’ information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line.

While on a secure page, such as an order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Google Chrome and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just ‘surfing’. If and when we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted. If you have any questions about the security at our website, please email us at our contact web page.
