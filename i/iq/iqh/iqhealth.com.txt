Overview
Cerner Corporation, its subsidiaries and its affiliates ("Cerner") is committed to protecting the privacy and security of its users. Cerner’s goal is to provide you with a personalized Internet experience that delivers the information, resources and services that are most relevant and helpful to you. In order to achieve this goal, Cerner sometimes collects information during your visits to understand what differentiates you from other users of Cerner.com. Cerner operates under the following set of strict privacy principles:
The only information Cerner obtains about individual users to its Web site is that supplied voluntarily by users.
In cases when Cerner may need personal information to provide users with customized content or to inform them about new features or services, users are explicitly asked for that information.
Personally identifiable information provided by users (name, e-mail or home address, etc.) will not be disclosed to anyone unless users indicate that Cerner may do so, or unless required by law, in conjunction with a government inquiry, or in litigation or dispute resolution.
Only statistical information about Cerner.com users as a group (usage habits, demographics) may be shared with any affiliate, subsidiary, sponsor, advertiser or partner of Cerner, unless an appropriate confidentiality agreement is in place. Cerner employs strict security measures to safeguard online transactions. All personal information is stored in a secured database.
The following discloses Cerner’s information gathering and dissemination practices for Cerner.com. Additional terms and conditions, if any, regarding the collection and use of your information may also be provided to you before you sign up for a particular service. Here you will learn what personally identifiable information of yours is collected, how and when Cerner might use your information, how Cerner protects your information, who has access to your information, and how you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.
Your privacy is important to us. By participating in the Council of Better Business Bureau's BBBOnLine® Privacy Program we have made a commitment to meet the program’s strict requirements regarding how we treat your information and have it verified by BBBOnLine. Further information about this program is available at http://www.bbbonline.org .
What Information is Collected
Cerner collects certain information from its users in three ways: (a) from Cerner Web server logs, (b) with cookies and (c) directly from the user.
(a) IP Addresses (Server Log Information)
An IP address is a number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet. All computer identification on the Internet is conducted with IP addresses, which allow computers and servers to recognize and communicate with each other. Cerner collects IP addresses in order to conduct system administration, report aggregate information to affiliates, subsidiaries, sponsors, advertisers or partners, and to conduct site analysis. Cerner will also use IP addresses to identify any users who refuse to comply with Cerner's Terms of Use Agreement, and to identify users who threaten Cerner’s service, site, user, clients or others.
(b) Cookies
Cerner places a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer. Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to an individual's hard disk for record keeping purposes. Cerner.com uses cookies during your online session to deliver content specific to your interests. Cookies allow Cerner to avoid showing you the same ad or other message repeatedly.
