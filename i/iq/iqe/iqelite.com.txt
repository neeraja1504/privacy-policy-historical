Here are some of the questions that you might like to have answered.
How is my data used?
Great question! The information gathered about you when you register with IQ Elite and subscribe to our Services is used to offer you our different Services. All precautions have been taken on our databases to archive your information in a secure environment. Only a small number of our employees have access to your information, which is only accessible in case of necessity.

What is this 'data'?
Another great question! Glad you asked. Any personal information from your profile, messages on your chats or even your Facebook profile is what we mean by 'private data'.
We would never:
publish private chats
sell Facebook content
sell your pictures or personal information
All your data belongs to you and it stays that way!
How do you collect my information?
All the information we receive about you, actually comes from you! This is either information filled out by yourself or by integrating your facebook into your profile. You control how much you wish to share with us. You can always refuse to provide us and other members with personal information, however this may prevent them from engaging in certain Site related activities.
How do you protect my information?
We adopt appropriate data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction of your personal information, username, password, transaction information and any other data stored on our Site.
Who’s going to get my information?
Like we said before, no one will be getting their hands on your information! Not even your mother! And don't worry about receiving any spam emails, our email lists are safe and secure. We are as careful and concerned about your privacy as you are.
How do I to stop receiving emails from you in the future?
If you feel the notifications we send you start to become a bit more than you had expected, feel free to edit your Email Notifications. However we recommend that you don't unsubscribe from all our newsletters. We would like to know how you are doing and to keep you updated about our latest development.

What if a member is very persistent?
