iQU as a Data Processor (Customers)
As a service provider to its customers, iQU will be considered as the Data Processor. As a Data Processors, we can provide you with flexibility and control over how we process your data.
To handle the Personally Identifiable Information - PII (end user’s IP addresses and any device identifiers), iQU has optimized the data gathering for these real-time actions (before they enter in the Data Processor's reporting databases):
a) Obfuscate the last octet of the IP address to be replaced with a "0" and anonymized;
b) Replace values that are passed in unique device ID macros with an empty string;
An end Advertiser’s user can send a request to us to delete any records that contain their PII, specifically their unique device ID. Depending on the business nature of the end user, iQU will directly inform the Data Controler to erase all the specific data and then reach out to any Partners/Publishers that iQU works with to also delete any records that have been stored for those end users. The Data Processor and therefore the Data Controller, will be updating the retention of the log/event level reporting (conversion report, click logs) to go back by only 25 months.
