As such, we have established and implemented this Privacy Policy to inform visitors to the Site and users of the ILTR Features how we use and protect the information we collect through the Site and ILTR Features.

1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU AND HOW DO WE USE IT?
Types of Information We Collect
Personal information means information that can be used to identify and contact you. You need to submit personal information to access certain aspects of the Site and the ILTR Features.
We collect personal information when you subscribe to our newsletter; participate in feedback forms, questionnaires, contests or sweepstakes; purchase a product through the ILTR Features; or receive customer or technical support.
We collect information from you such as your name, address, email address, telephone number and date of birth when utilizing the Site and ILTR Features. When registering products through the Site we also collect information about your products and where you purchased your products.
How We Use Your Personal Information
The personal information you provide to us will allow us to fulfill any product or service orders; alert you of new products or services, features, or enhancements; handle your customer service questions or issues; administer promotions, contests and sweepstakes; and notify you of promotions, updates, or special offers that we think may interest you. We also use your email address and phone number as part of the ILTR  Features in sending you messages about the ILTR  Features and other general announcements.
We keep track of your interactions with us, including but not limited to your activity within the ILTR  Features. We may use personal information that you provide to us to send messages to you in response to your request to perform an activity in connection with your use of any of the ILTR  Features. We may also use your personal information to contact you when necessary.
We may use your personal information with non-personal information that we have collected in a manner such that the end-product does not personally identify you or any other user of the ILTR  Features. We may make your personal information non-personally identifiable by either combining it with information about other users (aggregating your personal information with information about other users), or by removing characteristics (such as your name or email address) that make the information personally identifiable. This process is known as de-personalizing your information.
You grant us a royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable and fully transferable right and license to use your personal information in connection with the creation and development of analytical and statistical analysis tools relating to the use of the customer data we collect in providing the ILTR  Features (the Analytical Data). We are expressly authorized to make any commercial use of the Analytical Data, including without limitation, sharing the Analytical Data with third parties, provided that we do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer from us any part of the Analytical Data that personally identifies any ILTR  Features users.
Cookies
“Cookies” are small bits of electronic information that a website sends to a visitor’s browser and are stored on the visitor’s hard drive. Like many websites, we employ cookies in certain areas of the Site to allow us to provide information to make your online experience more convenient. For example, when you return to the Site after logging in, cookies provide information to the Site so that the Site will remember who you are on subsequent visits, speeding up or enhancing your experience of the ILTR  Features by, for instance, tailoring content to you. Cookies also prevent items placed in a shopping basket from disappearing by the time you checkout.

We use your personal information to complete transactions, respond to your requests, deliver products and services you request, and send communications to you about promotions, updates, or special offers (which may be offered by ILTR  or one of its business partners) that may be of interest to you. We may also use your personal information to provide analyses of our users in the aggregate (including Analytical Data subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy) to prospective partners and other third parties. In addition, we will share the personal information we collect from you under the following circumstances:

If we become involved in a merger, acquisition or other transaction involving the sale of some or all of ILTR’s assets, user information, including personal information collected from you through your use of the ILTR  Features, could be included in the transferred assets. Should such an event occur, we will use reasonable means to notify you through email and/or a prominent notice on the Site.
Service Providers
We may share your personal information with service providers that we engage for the purpose of processing information on our and your behalf. For example, we may partner with other companies to process payments for the ILTR  Features. Additionally, we may partner with other companies to process, analyze, and/or store data, including, but not limited to, Analytical Data. While providing services for us, these companies may access your personal information. To the extent applicable, we require these entities to comply with this Privacy Policy and appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
4. Additional Information You Should Know About Third Parties
This Privacy Policy does not cover the information practices of third party websites linked to the Site. Although we encourage such third parties to adopt and follow their own privacy policies, we are not responsible for their collection and use of your personal information. You should refer to the privacy policies and statements of other websites or contact the respective web-masters of those websites to obtain information regarding their information collection, use and disclosure policies.
When you have clicked on a third party logo or URL displayed on our Site which links you to a different website, our Privacy Policy no longer applies and you must read the privacy policy of the third party to see how your personal information will be handled on their website.
5. WHAT CHOICES DO YOU HAVE ABOUT THE COLLECTION AND USE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
Control of Your Information
You may change or delete any information you’ve shared with use by sending us an email. We do keep records of past purchases and periodically back up information, so it may not be possible for you to delete all information we have stored, and we may retain certain information to prevent fraud and for customer and order management purposes.
Opting Out of Receiving Communications from Us

You agree that if the matter remains unresolved for forty-five (45) days after notification (via certified mail or personal delivery) that a dispute exists, all parties shall join in mediation services in Los Angeles, California with a mutually agreed mediator in an attempt to resolve the dispute. Should you file any arbitration claims, or any administrative or legal actions without first having attempted to resolve the matter by mediation, then you agree that you will not be entitled to recover attorneys’ fees, even if you would otherwise be entitled to them.
Dispute Resolution for Residents of the European Union
If you are a resident of the European Union, in the event that you have any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Privacy Policy, you may report your claim to the European Union Data Protection Authorities located in your jurisdiction.
