Sharing information with our IAC companies enables us to provide you with information about a variety of products and services that might interest you. All IAC companies comply with privacy policies available at each company's site. IAC companies also comply with applicable privacy and security laws and, at a minimum, in any commercial e-mail they send to you, will give you the opportunity to choose not to receive such e-mail messages in the future.

If you want to learn more about their privacy practices, we encourage you to visit the websites of those third parties. These entities or their servers may be located either inside or outside the United States.
Aggregated and non-personal information. We may share aggregated and non-personal information we collect under any of the above circumstances. We may also share it with third parties and other IAC companies to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our websites and on websites of third parties. We may combine non-personal information we collect with additional non-personal information collected from other sources. We also may share aggregated information with third parties, including advisors, advertisers and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis.

Non-personal information (such as your user name) is publicly viewable via your user profile on the IWON Site. Any visitor to the IWON Site can view any users' profile pages. This is one reason why we recommend not using your real name as your user name.

See "USER SUBMISSIONS", below.
THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES
There are a number of places on or via the IWON Site or IWON Services where you may click on a link to access other websites that do not operate under this Privacy Policy. For example, if you click on an advertisement or a search result on our website, you may be taken to a website that we do not control. These third-party websites may independently solicit and collect information from you, including personal information, and, in some instances, provide us with information about your activities on those websites. We recommend that you consult the privacy statements of all third-party websites you visit by clicking on the "privacy" link typically located at the bottom of the webpage you are visiting.
We offer you access to "co-branded" services that are jointly provided by IWON and selected companies. In many cases, these co-branded services will contain IWON branding, but may not be hosted by IWON. You may notice that you are on a co-branded site if the pages say "provided by", if standard IWON branding is not displayed on the top of the page, or if you are asked to subscribe for any service or provide additional information. In such cases, if you use the co-branded service, IWON may be entitled to receive information about what you do when using that service.
If you elect to provide additional personal information using a co-branded service, the information you provide may be shared or jointly retained by the provider of that service in accordance with that provider's privacy policies and terms of service. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of these other companies and to contact these companies directly if you have any questions about their use of this information.
HOW YOU CAN ACCESS YOUR INFORMATION
If you have registered with the IWON Site, you have the ability to review and update your personal information online by logging into your account. You can also review and update your personal information by contacting us. More information about how to contact us is provided below.
If you have registered with the IWON Site you also may choose to close your account at any time by clicking here. You will need to be signed into the member account that you would like to cancel. If you are not currently signed into an account, you will be prompted to so do during the cancellation process.

If you close your account, we may still retain certain information associated with your account for analytical purposes and recordkeeping integrity, as well as to prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, enforce our terms and conditions, take actions we deem necessary to protect the integrity of our website or our users, or take other actions otherwise permitted by law. In addition, if certain information has already been provided to third parties as described in this Privacy Policy, retention of that information will be subject to those third parties' policies.
YOUR CHOICES ABOUT COLLECTION AND USE OF YOUR INFORMATION
You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result in your inability to use or access certain features of the IWON Site or IWON Services, purchase products or services, participate in a promotion, ask a question, or initiate other transactions on our website.
When you register on our website, you may be given a choice as to whether you want to receive email messages and/or newsletters about new features, events, product updates, improvements, special offers, or containing special distributions of content by us. At any time you can choose to no longer receive commercial or promotional emails or newsletters from us by clicking on the My Account page and editing your preferences with respect to the receipt of commercial or promotional emails, or by contacting customer service. You also will be given the opportunity, in any commercial e-mail that we send to you, to opt out of receiving such messages in the future. It may take up to 10 days for us to process an opt-out request. We may send you other types of transactional and relationship e-mail communications, such as service announcements, administrative notices, and surveys, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them. Please note that changing information in your account, or otherwise opting out of receipt of promotional email communications will only affect future activities or communications from us. If we have already provided your information to a third party (such as a credit card processing partner or an event provider) before you have changed your preferences or updated your information, you may have to change you preferences directly with that third party.
You may tell us not to share your personal information with third parties or the IAC family of companies for direct marketing purposes by going to the My Account page and editing your preferences with respect to the sharing of information or by contacting customer service.
If you have installed an IWON Software Product, you may terminate the collection of information due to the installation of IWON Software Products at any time by removing all IWON Software Products from your computer. All information collected up to the date on which you remove all IWON Software Products from your computer will be treated in accordance with the Privacy Policy in effect at the time of use, and your then-current preferences as indicated in your profile. You may uninstall or remove the IWON Software Products at any time by using the Windows add/remove programs functions or following the instructions listed on our website at http://www1.iwon.com/software_products/uninstall/.
HOW WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions. In addition, we use encryption in the transmission of your sensitive personal information between your system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your personal information.
We want you to feel confident using our website to transact business. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure email. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission's website at http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.
FORUMS
The IWON Site may offer profile pages and/or various forums or other areas for users to engage in public commentary or discussions, where you can post information about yourself and others, and communicate with other users. Such postings are governed by our Terms of Service. In addition, such postings may appear on other websites or when searches are executed on the subject of your posting. Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable web pages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information. Once you have posted information, you may not be able to edit or delete such information.
