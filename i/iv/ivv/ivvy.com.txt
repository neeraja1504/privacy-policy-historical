While we have privacy rules in place to protect your Personal Information, the overseas recipient may not be subject to privacy obligations or to any principles similar to the Australian Privacy Principles.  The overseas recipient may also be subject to a foreign law which could compel disclosure of Personal Information to a third party, for example, an overseas authority.
If you consent to the disclosure and the overseas recipient handles the information in breach of the Australian Privacy Principles, you will not be able to seek redress under the Privacy Act, may not be able to seek redress in the overseas jurisdiction and we will not be accountable under the Privacy Act.

Integrity and access
Security
iVvy will endeavour to protect the confidentiality of its client's information, account information and personal communications to the fullest extent possible and consistent with the law and the legitimate interests of iVvy, its partners, its resellers, its employees and other clients of iVvy. To protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of information that is collected from clients, iVvy has physical, electronic, and managerial security procedures in place.
Considerations when you send information to us electronically
While we do all we reasonably can to protect your Personal Information from misuse, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure, including investing in security software, no data transfer over the internet is 100% secure. The open nature of the internet is such that information exchanged via the internet may be accessed and used by people other than those for whom the data is intended. If you send us any information, including (without limitation) Personal Information, it is sent at your own risk.
If you access another website from our websites, you do so and provide Personal Information in accordance with the terms and conditions under which the provider of that website operates.
Modification of client information
You may request access to your Personal Information or correct any inaccurate or out of date information (including unsubscribing from any mail lists) by contacting our Privacy Officer using the details below or by updating your information by logging into the iVvy software (https://www.ivvy.com/a/[youraccountname]).
You may request the source of any information we collect from a third party.  We will provide this at no cost, unless under the Privacy Act or other law there is a reason for this information being withheld.
If there is a reason under the Privacy Act or other law for us not to provide you with information, we will give you a written notice of refusal setting out the reasons for the refusal (except to the extent it would be unreasonable or unlawful to do so) and advise you of the mechanisms available to you to complain about the refusal.
Retention and Deletion
iVvy may retain your Client Information as long as you continue to use the Services. It may also be necessary for us to retain your Personal Information to comply with applicable law, guidelines, codes or regulatory requirements. You may close your account by contacting us. Even if we delete your Information it may persist on backup or archival media and other information systems.
Third party websites
We are not responsible for the content, privacy or security practices or the content of any third party websites accessed from our websites and we make no representations or warranties in respect of those websites.  You must therefore read the third party's privacy policy and satisfy yourself as to the content and appropriateness of that policy.
How we modify this Privacy Policy
iVvy may from time to time update its privacy policy by posting an amended privacy policy that is always accessible by clicking on the "Privacy Policy" link on iVvy's homepage.
You should check the Privacy Policy through this link periodically (including on each occasion you provide us with Personal Information) for modifications by clicking on the link provided near the top of the Privacy Policy for a listing of material modifications and their effective dates.
If we make any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this Site prior to the change becoming effective.
Dealing with a complaint
If you make a complaint about a privacy matter, our Privacy Officer will respond as soon as possible (but within 14 days) and advise you who in our company will have responsibility for investigating and managing your complaint.
We will try to resolve your complaint within 30 days of receiving it.  If this is not possible, we will contact you and provide you with an estimate of the time it will take to investigate and manage the complaint.
