Your browser has options to accept, reject or provide you with notice when a cookie is sent. We may use cookies for many purposes, including (without limitation) to save information so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit the Websites, and to deliver content (which may include third party advertisements) specific to your interests. In addition, we may employ "clear GIFs" (a.k.a. Web Beacons) and similar tools, which are used to track usage patterns anonymously (i.e., in a non-personally-identifiable manner). In addition, we may also use these tools in HTML-based emails sent to users to track which emails are opened by recipients.

We encourage you to review the privacy policies of those other Websites so you can understand how they collect, use and share your information.
Third Party Advertisers
We may allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the Websites. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the Websites. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content you see. You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks for more information on their practices and for instructions on how to opt-out of certain practices. This Privacy Policy does not apply to them, and we cannot control their activities.

The security of your personal data is important to us. We have implemented and follows industry standard measures to protect against unauthorized access to and unlawful interception or processing of Personal data. We also protect account information by placing it in a secure database that is only accessible by certain qualified employees of Ivy Exec. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your Personal data, we cannot ensure or warranty the security of any such Personal data.
Legal Disclaimer
We may disclose your Personal data when required by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on us. As such, we cannot ensure that your Personal data will not be disclosed to third parties.
