As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.
We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site and addon, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.
3.2 Cookies
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this website. Cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but the ability for our service to provide accurate personaliztion for you will be limited.
3.3 Third Party Search Engines
When you execute a query on selected search engines, the KwiClick browser extension makes additional network connections to the search engine and execute additional queries. The additional network connections may cause you to exceed a search engine's bandwidth limit more quickly. The additional search engine queries may affect the search engine's own personalization algorithms.

The ads that we deliver to users may be provided by our advertising partners. We share Web site usage information about users with reputable third parties for the purpose of targeting our advertisements on this site. The information that our advertising partners collect is not personally identifiable.

The security of your information is extremely important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can send email us at privacy@kwiclick.com.
4.1 Business Transitions
In the event KwiClick goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, we will ensure the confidentiality of any information involved in such transactions and provide notice before information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
