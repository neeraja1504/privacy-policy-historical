Kaplan reserves the right to reject an applicant or terminate a student’s enrollment in the program if the student’s continued participation represents a risk to their health and safety or to the health and safety of other students or staff, or if, notwithstanding reasonable accommodations, in the opinion of Kaplan, the student’s physical or mental condition makes the student unable or unlikely to successfully complete their program. Refunds in such circumstances are at the discretion of Kaplan.

9. Twin accommodation: At Kaplan’s discretion, students may be required to book single room accommodation instead of twin room accommodation.
10. Under 18 year olds: Kaplan delivers adult courses (except for programs advertised as being for juniors or young learners). Therefore, students aged 16 and 17 are advised that they will be attending classes with students aged 18 and over.

Terms and Conditions
1. Rules and regulations: Students’ arrangements with Kaplan are governed by the law of the country where the particular school attended is located.
2. Arrivals and departures: All accommodation is booked from the Saturday or Sunday before the course start date until the Saturday morning after the course end date, unless otherwise advised. A partial week may be counted as 1 week’s accommodation. Students arriving between 22:30 – 6:00 may be asked to book alternative accommodation in a hotel on their first night due to late/early arrival at accommodation, or be charged an extra night of accommodation.
3. Late arrivals, vacations and absences: If you begin your enrollment late or are absent during your course, no refund will be made for the time missed. Periods of absence cannot be made up with a free extension of the course. Session Break dates are pre-built into the Academic Year and Academic Semester programs and students cannot make changes to these dates. Breaks taken at other times will be marked as periods of absence. For other courses, granting of any Session Breaks after the course has started will be at the discretion of individual schools, according to visa regulations, and may incur a change fee or be marked as a period of absence.
4. Meals and classes missed: No refunds or substitutions will be made for meals or classes missed due to exams, excursions, internships, first day orientation or other obligations that fall outside the normal schedule.
5. Public holidays: Classes are normally not held and most school facilities are closed on public holidays. All published course start dates fall on a Monday. If the Monday is a public holiday, the start date will fall on a Tuesday. Compensation will not be made for classes not offered on public holidays.
6. Campus facilities: Students attending a Kaplan school at a university or college campus location are advised that campus facilities may not be available during campus holidays. Further details are available from the Kaplan booking office.
7. Change fees: A minimum of 4 weeks’ notice is required for any change. If you request a change of school location, course dates, accommodation or programme type after your course has started, you will be charged a change fee of GBP60, EUR85, USD100, CAD100, AUD75, NZD75 which is payable at the time the request is made. Kaplan is not obliged to fulfill any change request. Academic Year or Academic Semester students cannot transfer to a different Kaplan school during term time. If changing to a location where fees are lower, the difference in fees will not be refunded. If changing to a more expensive location or programme, the difference in fees will be charged. All changes are subject to Kaplan’s discretion and require approval of the Programme Director. You will not be charged a change fee if you extend your course, but late homestay extensions in Canada may require a re-placement fee of CAD100. It is the responsibility of the student to pay for any course or accommodation extensions. Any change of tuition resulting in a reduction in lessons will be treated as a termination of the existing booking and rebooking, and will thus be subject to the standard terms & conditions governing terminations (see ‘Termination Policy’).
8. Duration of lessons: All English lessons are 45 minutes in duration unless otherwise stated. Courses run from Monday to Friday and lessons are scheduled in the morning or the afternoon. Kaplan cannot guarantee a specific timetable.
9. Substitution policy: If, after the placement test taken on arrival at the school, a student is found to be at a level which is not appropriate for their booked course, the school reserves the right to place the student in an appropriate level class, which may have fewer lessons and a different curriculum. Students who do not have the ability to follow any course on offer may be required to terminate their studies with Kaplan. We also reserve the right to cancel courses at short notice due to insufficient demand.
10. Programme changes: : Kaplan has the right to change course dates, course curricula, tutors, locations and programs at any time at its discretion. However, in cases where the course is rescheduled prior to the start of the first course and the new date is unacceptable to the student, all fees will be refunded.
11. Prices: Kaplan has the right to change prices due to tax increases, governmental actions or other events beyond Kaplan’s control. Prices are valid for courses starting in 2015.
12. Books and learning materials: All books and learning materials will be made available to students during their course. A book deposit (USD40) may be charged at the beginning of the course. This will be refunded at the end of the course, if the books are returned in good condition. Some specialized courses may require the purchase of books. In Canada, New Zealand and Australia a materials fee is charged to students to cover the cost of such items.
13. Residential housing deposit: A refundable housing deposit of up to GBP250, EUR350, USD500, CAD600, NZD250-500 or AUD250-500 may be charged on arrival to students taking residential accommodation in the UK, Ireland, USA, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. The deposit is returned unless there is damage, loss or extra cleaning to be paid for on the student’s departure. In some cases the deposit may be non-refundable if the booking is cancelled. Additional fees may also apply in some locations (e.g. utilities, cleaning, linen).
14. Expulsion/Suspension: Any student who commits a criminal offence, violates the student conduct code or school policy, has, in Kaplan’s opinion, a poor attendance record (whether or not such attendance is in breach of any visa attendance requirements), is absent for 14 consecutive days without notification (USA and Canada), or fails to pay an amount he or she is directly or indirectly liable to pay Kaplan in order to undertake the course, may be expelled or suspended. No refund will be given and the immigration authorities will be informed.

Such companies and persons will in no circumstances have any liability for indirect or consequential losses or damages.
16. Force majeure: Kaplan will not be liable in cases where Kaplan is unable to fulfil any services to which they are contractually bound because of fire, natural disaster, act of government, failure of suppliers or subcontractors, labour disputes or other reasons which are beyond Kaplan’s control.
17. Codes of practice: Kaplan has agreed to observe and be bound by the Code of Practice for the Pastoral Care of International Students published by the New Zealand Minister of Education and by the Australian National Code of Practice 2007 and the Educational Services for Overseas Students Act 2000 (ESOS Act 2000).

20. Student Visa Australia/UK/USA/Canada/New Zealand: Student visa holders are required to provide Kaplan with a current residential address and telephone number at all times, maintain satisfactory academic progress and attend a minimum of 80% of their course.

This agreement, and the availability of complaints and appeals process, does not remove the right of the student to take action under Australia’s customer protection laws.
POSTPONEMENT POLICY
Postponements will only be made on receipt of a valid written customer request.
Bookings may be postponed a maximum of two times within one year of the original booking date. Bookings may only be postponed by up to 6 months at a time.

Cancellations made prior to the course start date but after arrival in the US on a Kaplan-issued Form I-20, will result in forfeiture of tuition, and any associated accommodation fees, equal to the first 4 weeks for courses between 1-11 weeks and the first 6 weeks for courses 12 weeks or longer.
New Zealand: Tuition (in accordance with the NZQA and Kaplan refund policy):
- Courses of 13 weeks or longer: cancellations or terminations made prior to or within the first 10 working days of the course will be refunded in full, less a deduction for costs incurred by Kaplan, up to a maximum of 25% of the total fee paid. Kaplan will provide you with details of the cost components for the purpose of working out the maximum deductible percentage. In the event of a dispute over the cost component deducted, you can refer the matter to the International Education Appeal Authority (IEAA).
Courses 2 to 12 weeks
- Courses of 5 weeks or more but less than 3 months: Where a student withdraws within the first 5 days of the course for which attendance is required (i.e. Orientation), Kaplan may retain up to 25% of the full amount of any payments made by the student in respect of the course, and will refund the balance to the student.
- Courses of up to and including 4 weeks and 6 days: Where a student withdraws within the first 2 days of the course for which attendance is required (i.e. Orientation), Kaplan may retain up to 50% of the full amount of any payments made by the student in respect of the course, and will refund the balance to the student.
Students who withdraw before the course commences will also be subject to the above criteria.
UK and Ireland: 'Distance Contract' means a distance contract or an off-premises contract as defined in the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013 (as amended from time to time). In the event of a Distance Contract, students for the UK or Ireland who are EU citizens shall have the right to cancel the legally binding contract formed in accordance with paragraph 1 of these terms and conditions if the student gives notice of cancellation to Kaplan within fourteen calendar day period beginning on the day on which the booking confirmation was issued by Kaplan. If a student exercises his or her right to cancel during this fourteen day period, he or she will receive a full refund of all amounts already paid by the student less any fees charged for services already performed by Kaplan. However, if the student has already commenced studying with Kaplan during the 14 day period, he or she must pay a reasonable charge calculated by Kaplan for the period of study undertaken. To exercise the right to cancel under the EU distance contract terms, the student must inform Kaplan at 2nd floor, Warwick Building, Kensington Village, Avonmore Road, London W14 8HQ, UK of the student's decision to cancel this agreement by a clear statement (e.g. by a letter sent by post, fax or e-mail). The student may use the model cancellation form found at www.kaplaninternational.com/terms, but it is not obligatory. The student can also electronically fill in and submit the model cancellation form or any other clear statement on the Kaplan website www.kaplaninternational.com. If the student uses this option, Kaplan will communicate to the student an acknowledgement of receipt of such a cancellation on a durable medium (e.g. by email) without delay.
UK: Visa students: once a CAS number has been issued confirming full time status, no refunds or course cancellations are permissible other than in the instance of visa refusal and subject to meeting the following criteria: the amounts paid will be refunded, less an administration charge of GBP150 (inc. VAT) (plus any courier and transfer charges) on production of the following documents: (1) an agent certified copy of the visa refusal letter (GV51), (2) an agent certified copy of the student’s passport showing both a photograph and signature; (3) where the payor was not the student, an original authority letter from the student authorising the repayment to the payor and (4) where the student is already in the UK, evidence satisfactory to Kaplan that the student has left the UK. Refunds will only be made under this paragraph if requested in writing with the necessary supporting documents within four weeks after the commencement of the course (published date). In circumstances where an application is refused by UKVI on the grounds of fraudulent documentation or other irregularities, no refunds will be granted in respect of monies paid. Where students are studying on a Student Visitor Visa or a Child Visitor Visa, Kaplan's standard Cancellation policy will apply.
**TERMINATION POLICY  **
‘Termination’ means stopping or leaving all or part of the course or courses booked, including extensions, once the first course has started. When determining the number of weeks completed, a partial week will be counted as a whole week, provided the student was present at least one day during the scheduled week. Used weeks of discounted tuition and accommodation packages will be charged at the full brochure weekly rate when any refund is calculated.
In all cases additional service charges (e.g. airport transfers, courier fees, enrollment fees, medical insurance, accommodation placement fee, program supplement fee, etc.) are non-refundable and written notification of termination must be given to the school Principal or Director. Students who terminate their program may not be eligible to receive a Kaplan certificate and will not be allowed to stay in Kaplan accommodation.
Tuition
UK, Ireland, and Australia: No refunds will be made for tuition. Tuition fees are non-transferable to other students.
Canada: Students wishing to terminate must give 4 weeks’ written notice to the School Director (or according to provincial requirements). The refund will be calculated as below according to the percentage of the course completed including the notice period:

USA: Except as noted below only for California resident students attending our California schools, for all English courses including Vacation, General and Intensive English, Academic Year/ Semester General/ Intensive and English for Business / Intensive English for Business, the first 4 weeks shall be forfeited and refunds will be calculated as follows for terminations (i.e. the last date you are enrolled on the program and for which attendance is required) made:
- any time during the 1st four weeks: 4-weeks’ tuition shall be charged and 100% of the remaining unused tuition shall be refunded
- after the 4th week and up to halfway through the course: a pro-rata refund of the remaining unused tuition shall be given
- after 50% of the course has been completed: no refund shall be given
For all Exam Preparation courses, including GRE®, GMAT®, Cambridge and TAE, refunds will be calculated, as follows for terminations (i.e. the last date you are enrolled on the program and for which attendance is required) made:

- after 2 training sessions but before 3 training sessions, 50% of tuition paid (less shipping fee) shall be refunded

(b) The institution shall pay or credit refunds within 45 days of a student's cancellation or withdrawal.
(c) The institution shall provide a pro rata refund of nonfederal student financial aid program moneys paid for institutional charges to students who have completed 60 percent or less of the period of attendance.
New Zealand: The same conditions apply on termination as to cancellations. See cancellation policy above.
In all cases where a student terminates his or her studies the relevant immigration authorities will be informed.
**Accommodation  **
Accommodation: UK, Ireland, USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand: Students must give 4 weeks’ notice (or 8 weeks’ notice for discounted accommodation packages) in writing to the School Director/Principal. A refund will be made of the unused accommodation fee less the applicable notice period and the applicable change fee. For terminations made after 50% of the booking has been completed (60% for students attending our California locations), no refund will be given, except in Canada, New Zealand and Australia. Some residential options may have additional terms and conditions relating to reservation cancellation.
**PARTNER SCHOOL  **
Special conditions apply to our Partner School in Malta: Cancellations must be made at least 14 days before the first course start date for a full refund of accommodation and tuition fees. For late cancellations made less than 14 days before the course start date, a refund will be made less one week’s accommodation and tuition fees. No fees will be refunded if a programme is terminated after the start date of the course.
GENERAL  These Terms and Conditions may differ according to any changes in the policy made by the accrediting body or government (local or national) where the school is located.
