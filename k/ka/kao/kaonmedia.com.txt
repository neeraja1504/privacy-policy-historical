By “Personal Information,” we mean information that on its own or in combination with other information, can identify you, such as your name, phone number, postal address, email address and log-in information. Personal Information does not include aggregate or anonymous information. Aggregate information is information that we collect about a group or category of products, services, or users that is not personally identifiable or from which individual identities are removed. We may use and disclose aggregate information, and other anonymous, for various purposes at our sole discretion and without notice or liability to you. Aggregate information that includes Personal Information is considered Personal Information until it has been anonymized. Anonymous information is considered non-Personal Information. Usage data collected is generally aggregate and anonymous so it does not identify you personally and is therefore not Personal Information.
Our Policy describes information that we collect, use, share, and store, as well as in separate notices given when the Service is purchased or downloaded or used.
