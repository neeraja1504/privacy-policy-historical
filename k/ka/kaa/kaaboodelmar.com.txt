Privacy Policy - KAABOO Del Mar
The KAABOO-Del Mar, LLC (“KAABOO”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) tells you about our online collection and use of data on the www.kaaboodelmar.com website, the www.kaabooexperience.com website, the KAABOO application and the KAABOO social media pages (the collectively the “Services”). By using this Services, you understand and agree to the terms of this Policy. In addition, please review our Terms of Use, which governs your use of the Services and any content you submit to the Services.
BY DISCLOSING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO KAABOO, YOU CONSENT TO THE COLLECTION, STORAGE AND PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION BY KAABOO IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY.
1. What is Personal Information?
As used herein, the term “Personal Information” means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, address, telephone number, mobile number, or e-mail address), or information about that individual that is directly linked to personally identifiable information. Personal Information does not include “aggregate information”, which is data we collect about the use of the Service or users from which individual identities or other Personal Information has been removed. Personal Information does not include Usage Information (as defined below) or a Device Identifier (as defined below) that is not connected to Personal Information. This Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate or Usage Information that is not connected to Personal Information.
2. Information Collected on our Services
Information You Provide Us. You may be asked to provide us with Personal Information including your name and e-mail address when you sign up for our mailing list or register for the KAABOO application.
Information We Collect. KAABOO collects information about you when you when you access the Services. We may collect information about the website that referred you to us, your IP address, browser type and language, and access times. We also may collect navigational information, including information about the pages you view, the links you click, and other actions taken in connection with the Services. All of this information is considered “Usage Information.” Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but if KAABOO associates it with you as a specific and identifiable person, KAABOO treats it as Personal Information.
In the course of collecting Usage Information, KAABOO also automatically collects your IP address or other unique identifier (“Device Identifier”) for the computer, mobile device, technology or other device (collectively, “Device”) you use to access the Services. A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device when you access a website or its servers, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. When you visit the Services, we may view your Device Identifier. We may use this information to enhance the Services. The technologies used on the Services to collect Usage Information, including Device Identifiers may also include, without limitation:
Cookies. The Services use cookies. Cookies are small text files that are stored on a user’s computer and allow websites to remember information about users. You have the choice to set your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so check the “Help” menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.) It is up to you whether to allow us to send you cookies. However, please be aware that if you disable or reject cookies, some features on our Services may not work properly.
Web Beacons. Certain pages on the Services may contain “web beacons” (also known as Internet tags, pixel tags, tracking beacons and clear GIFs). A web beacon is a transparent graphic image placed on a web page or in an email, which indicates that a page or email has been viewed or that an email has been forwarded. In addition, a web beacon allows third parties to obtain information such as the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the beacon appears, the time the page containing the beacon was viewed, the type of browser used to view the page, and the information in cookies set by the third party. A web beacon may also tell your browser to get content from another server.
Information We Receive from Third Parties. We may receive information from third parties. For example, if you are on another website and you agree to share your Personal Information with KAABOO, that website will forward to us your Personal Information. You may also choose to participate in a third party application or feature (such as one of our Facebook or Twitter applications or a similar application or feature on a third party website) through which you allow us to collect and share (or the third party to collect and share) information about you, including Personal Information. If you access the Services through a third-party connection or log-in, we may also collect your user ID and/or username associated with that third-party service, and any information you have made public in connection with that service or which the third party shares with partner services.
We may also supplement the information we collect about you through the Services, with other information from third parties in order to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you, and to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you. We may combine the information we receive from third parties with information we collect through the Service. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to any Personal Information received, unless we have disclosed otherwise.
3. How We Use Your Information
KAABOO collects and uses your Personal Information and the other information we collect to improve our Services; to process your requests; to deliver advertisements; to send you newsletters, offers, promotions, information about upcoming events, confirmations, updates, security alerts, and support and administrative messages; to detect and prevent fraud; and to otherwise facilitate your use of and our administration and operation of the Services; and for any other purpose for which the information was collected.
At your request, we may send you marketing emails or newsletters. If you do not wish to receive marketing emails or newsletters from us, you may follow the “unsubscribe” instructions included within each email communication.
4. Who We Share Your Information With
Except as disclosed in this privacy policy, KAABOO does not share your Personal Information with any outside parties. We may share non-Personal Information, such as aggregate user statistics, demographic information, and Usage Information with third parties. We also may share your information as disclosed at the time you provide your information.
We may share your Personal Information with service providers who perform services on our behalf. For example, we may hire other companies to host the Services, process your requests, and to assist with our email communications. Those companies will be permitted to obtain only the Personal Information they need to provide the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose.
Your Personal Information may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, or sale of the company and/or its assets, as well as in the unlikely event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, in which Personal Information would be transferred as one of the business assets of the company.
We reserve the right to disclose your Personal Information if required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process, respond to claims, or protect the rights, property or safety of our company, employees, customers, or the public.

In accordance with our routine record keeping, we may delete certain records that contain Personal Information you have submitted through the Services. We are under no obligation to store such Personal Information indefinitely and disclaim any liability arising out of, or related to, the destruction of such Personal Information. In addition, you should be aware that it is not always possible to completely remove or delete all of your information from our databases without some residual data because of backups and other reasons.
7. Links to Other Sites
The Services may provide links to other websites that we do not own or operate. For instance, the Services may link to third party websites which provide services to KAABOO such as selling tickets and merchandise. This includes links from partners who may use our logo(s) as part of a co-branding agreement. To the extent that any linked websites are not part of the Services, we do not control, recommend or endorse and are not responsible for those websites or their content, products, services, or privacy policies or practices. These other websites may send their own cookies to your device, they may independently collect data or solicit Personal Information and may or may not have their own privacy notices or policies. You should also independently assess the authenticity of any website which appears or claims that it is one of our Services.
8. International Visitors
Personal information collected by KAABOO is stored and processed in the United States. If you access the Services from outside of the United States, you consent to the processing of your personal information in the United States.
9. Security of Your Personal Information
The security of your personal information is important to us. However, no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
