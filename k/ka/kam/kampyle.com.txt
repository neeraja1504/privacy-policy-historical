If you are a Client or a Website Visitor then you may use the tools that we make available on the Website to remove or modify certain information in your Account or Public Profile.

If we learn that we have collected Personal Information from a child under the age of 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from a child under the age of 13, please contact us at info [a] kampyle.com

Kampyle is a ISO27001:2005 Information Security Standard accredited, and we follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. All data collected during a feedback submission is encrypted during transmission. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially reasonable means to protect Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
