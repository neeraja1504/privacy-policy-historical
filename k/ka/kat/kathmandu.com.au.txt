Kathmandu will not use or disclose your personal information for purposes unrelated to the services we provide, unless we first obtain your consent.
Where we can, we will allow you to deal with us anonymously or by using a pseudonym. However, in some circumstances, this may not be possible, and Kathmandu may need to collect personal information from you to provide you with a delivery or other service. In some cases, if you do not provide the required personal information we will not be able to provide you with a service.

“Personal Data” means data which relates to a living individual who can be identified from the data, including an opinion about the individual.
For example, these types of information/data could include your name, contact details, age and health information.

These services are hosted and managed by organisations other than ourselves, and some of these services are hosted overseas. We use products and services maintained in Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Israel, China and the United States.
Your personal information may be stored in a secure and encrypted form overseas (e.g. in data storage and cloud computing facilities operated by us (or by third parties on Kathmandu’s behalf).

Website usage
Our websites are professionally hosted and operate in a secure environment. You should however be aware that there is always an inherent risk in transmitting your personal information via the Internet.
We use Comodo and Cybersource to process online orders. Customers can see their cards being debited in real time, all in an SSL secure environment.
Please do not enter any credit card details when contacting us via email, through our Live Chat function or through our website “Contact Us” form. These functions do not form part of online transactions which use Comodo and Cybersource and therefore your credit card details will not be encrypted in these situations.
We take website and credit card security extremely seriously, and always endeavour to provide a secure safe platform on which to conduct online transactions, all our websites use Comodo SSL. By using this, you guarantee the highest possible encryption levels for online transactions. Each certificate is signed with NIST recommended 2048 bit signatures and provides up to 256 bit encryption of customer data. This encryption scrambles details such as credit card number, billing details and delivery address so that generally, other computers are unable to decipher the information, ensuring privacy and security.
To make sure you are accessing a secure server, check for the unbroken key or closed lock symbol located generally either at the bottom left or top right of your browser window. If it appears, then SSL is active. You can double check this by looking at the URL as well. If SSL is active, then the first characters of that line will read ‘https’ rather than just ‘http’. It is important for you to protect against unauthorised access to your password and to your computer.
Ensure you logout when you have finished visiting our websites especially if you accessed them from a shared computer.
Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer for record-keeping purposes. The information collected may be used by Kathmandu to improve your experience on our website. For example, if you wish to make a purchase using our online store, they will collect information about what is in your shopping cart and assist us to maintain that shopping cart during the transaction.
We may also use web beacons, embedded in our website’s web pages, that work in conjunction with cookies to notify us what web pages on our website are visited by a particular IP address (including by reference to domain name), computer or device, the date and time of visit to our site, the duration of individual page views, information downloaded, hyperlinks selected and paths taken by the visitor through the site, the visitor's screen settings and other general information. That information will be collected either by us directly or by a service provider contracted for that purpose. By measuring how you interact with our website in this way, we may provide targeted marketing to you, based on your viewing activity of our website, whether directly or through online advertisement networks such as those operated by Google.
If you are a registered customer or Summit Club member on our website, we will retain information about your account, including contact details, address details and, to the extent that you make orders while logged in or by reference to your Summit Club membership, the status of your orders.
Any personal information that you submit to us using our website or in an email will only be used in accordance with this privacy policy.
