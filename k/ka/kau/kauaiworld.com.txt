Privacy
The information that thegardenisland.com collects about visitors while they are using the Service falls into two general categories:
1. Information You Provide to Us. thegardenisland.com may collect and store information, personal or otherwise, that you voluntarily supply either while on the thegardenisland.com website or in responding, via e-mail to a feature provided on the thegardenisland.com website. Some examples of this type of information include: demographic information that you electronically submit when you sign up for access to certain features on the Service, information (such as your name or e-mail address) that you electronically submit when you register for surveys, sweepstakes or contests on the thegardenisland.com website, information that you post on message boards on the thegardenisland.com website, and information contained in search requests or questions that you submit to the thegardenisland.com website. If you decline to supply or provide thegardenisland.com with certain information while using the Service, you may not be able to use or participate in some or all of the features offered through the Service.
2. Information that is Automatically Collected. thegardenisland.com also collects and stores information that is generated automatically as you navigate through the thegardenisland.com website. For example, to enhance your experience on the thegardenisland.com website, thegardenisland.com uses a standard feature found in browser software called a “cookie.” Cookies are small files that your web browser places on your hard drive for record-keeping purposes. By showing how and when visitors use the thegardenisland.com site, cookies help us track user trends and patterns. They also prevent you from having to re-enter your preferences on certain areas of the thegardenisland.com site where you have entered preference information before. thegardenisland.com also uses web beacons (also known as “single-pixel GIFs") to access cookies and to count users who visit the thegardenisland.com site or open thegardenisland.com's HTML-formatted email messages. Another example of information that thegardenisland.com automatically collects as you navigate the thegardenisland.com site is information about your computer's connection to the Internet. This information allows us, among other things, to improve the delivery of our Web pages to you and to measure traffic on the thegardenisland.com site.
