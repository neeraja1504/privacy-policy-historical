We use data collection devices, such as cookies or web beacons, on certain pages of the Websites to help analyze our web page flow, website performance and structure content, store your user preferences, and track and enhance your experience as a user on the Websites.

Generally, KMC will disclose such information to third parties only in the form of aggregate data (such as overall patterns or demographic reports) that does not describe or identify any individual user. KMC reserves the right, however, to disclose more specific information to the dealer you designate as a part of your Member Registration, as a part of your shopping experience or as a part of your interest in any Services and to other third parties, unless you select the "Opt-out" option during the member registration process or thereafter by using the applicable functionality available for updating your Personal Information.
We may provide aggregated, non-personally identifiable information to third parties for any legal purposes whatsoever, such as the number of users who searched for a particular term or item, or how many users clicked on a particular page or item on a Website. Such aggregated information does not identify you personally.
In addition, we will consider, and may release, information about you to third parties to comply with valid legal requirements such as a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena or court order, to enforce our Privacy Policy, Terms and Conditions of Use, Terms and Conditions of Sale or other agreements on the Websites, upon your request, or to contact, identify or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with our or others' rights or property, including but not limited to claims for infringement of intellectual property, invasion of privacy or situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person.

We use computer safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption, and we authorize access to Personal Information only for those employees who require it to fulfill their job responsibilities. ALTHOUGH WE EMPLOY MANY DIFFERENT SECURITY TECHNIQUES TO PROTECT SUCH DATA FROM UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS BY USERS, ABSOLUTE SECURITY DOES NOT EXIST ON THE INTERNET.

In the event a child under the age of 13 submits a request or question to us on a Website and identifies his or her age, we may use the child's email address for the sole purpose of responding to the child's question on a one-time-only basis. However, we will not use the child's email address for subsequent contact with the child, and we will delete that address from our records once we have responded. If we become aware that we have unknowingly collected Personal Information from a child under the age of 13, we will make reasonable efforts to delete such information from our database.
We do not sell or knowingly divulge ANY personally identifiable information regarding children under 13 to third parties, unless otherwise required to comply with applicable laws, to comply with a court order or subpoena, to enforce our Terms and Conditions of Use, or to protect the safety and security of our users and our Websites.

In addition, at any time after you have registered, you may "Opt-out" using the applicable functionality available for updating your Personal Information.
In some limited circumstances, such as to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our Terms and Conditions of Use, we may retain in our files information you have requested us to remove.
