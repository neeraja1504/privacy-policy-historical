Privacy | Kalibrr: Where Jobs Find You
Website Visitors
Like most website operators, Kalibrr collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Kalibrr’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Kalibrr’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Kalibrr may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
Kalibrr also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Kalibrr does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to Kalibrr’s websites choose to interact with Kalibrr in ways that require Kalibrr to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Kalibrr gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who use our forums to provide a username and email address. In each case, Kalibrr collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Kalibrr. Kalibrr does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
Aggregated Statistics
Kalibrr may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Kalibrr may reveal how many downloads a particular version got, or say which plugins are most popular based on checks from api. Kalibrr, a web service used by Kalibrr installations to check for new versions of Kalibrr and plugins. However, Kalibrr does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
Kalibrr discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Kalibrr’s behalf or to provide services available at Kalibrr’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Kalibrr’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Kalibrr will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations, as described above, Kalibrr discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Kalibrr believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Kalibrr, third parties, or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a Kalibrr website and have supplied your email address, Kalibrr may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Kalibrr and our products. We primarily use our blog and Facebook Page to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Kalibrr takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
