Your privacy is greatly repected here.
Collection And Use of Information
I do not collect any personal information at all on this site. As with all web sites, information about which pages you view is logged by my server, and your IP address is listed in the log. Other information commonly collected in a Web server log includes your browser version, your computer's operating system, and the date and time of your visit.
When you perform a search on this site, the words you searched for are recorded by Atomz, the company that provides the search service. Reports are available to me that list which words were searched for, but I don't know who it was that ran the search.
Cookies
This site does not use cookies at all.
Third Parties
Atomz provides my search service. When you view search results, those results appear to come from my site but are hosted on their servers. Atomz is not bound by my privacy policy and may collect and use information in ways other than specified in this privacy policy. I would suggest that you read their privacy policy.
