Handylist.org - Privacy
This Privacy Policy is effective as of June 12, 2007.
At Handylist.org, we believe privacy is very important. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of information we collect as well as steps we take to keep your private information private. Our aim is to help you make an educated decision when choosing to use the site and/or share information with us.
[This first section covers the overall Handylist.org policy. Click on the following links to skip down this page to more detail on the Personalized Home Page Privacy Notice or the Privacy Definitions and FAQ section.]
What This Privacy Policy Covers
This privacy policy pertains to the use of the Handylist.org web site at http://www.Handylist.org, and the Handylist services.
This privacy policy covers how Handylist treats information that Handylist collects and receives.
This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the Handylist.org Terms of Use. Your use of the Handylist.org.org website, the Handylist.org services and any information you provide on the website is subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use.
What This Privacy Policy Covers
This Privacy Policy applies only to websites and services that are owned and operated by Handylist.org. We do not exercise control over the sites displayed as search results or linked to or from within our various services. These other sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit information from you. We encourage you to read their privacy policies before you enter into an exchange with them.
Handylist.org may allow other companies to serve advertisements on its website. These third-party advertisers use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the website. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or web beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content to a certain audience.
The Information We Collect and How We Use It
Several Handylist.org services do not require you to register for an account or provide any personal information. Such services include posting and ad or story and browsing posts. We can provide these services just by sending you an email which, by clicking through, you can manage your posting without giving us personal information. When you browse the site, we place a cookie on your browser and associate your activity with that cookie.
For these no-registration-required services Handylist.org collects the following information:
Cookies: A cookie is a small file containing a unique string of characters that is sent from the Handylist.org servers and saved by your browser software. Using the cookie approach provides maximum privacy protection while also allowing Handylist.org to provide the desired personalized services. Browsers are typically set to accept cookies, however, you can change the settings on your browser to notify you when a site is sending a cookie to your browser or, alternatively, to refuse cookies altogether. If your cookies are disabled, these no-registration-required Handylist.org services will not function properly. If the Handylist.org cookie is cleaned from your browser, and you haven’t registered with personally identifiable information, then all your preferences will be lost, and you will need to reset your preferences to continue using Handylist.org’s personalized services.
Log information: When you use Handylist.org services, our servers automatically record the data that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. These “server logs” include data such as browser type, Internet Protocol address, your web request, the date and time of your requests, and your Handylist.org cookie(s) that uniquely identify your browser.
Search Query Data: Handylist.org search logs, including every search query, are deleted from the database after 72 hours. Furthermore, during these 72 hours, the search queries are stored in a one-way hash format which insures that the real search query cannot be recovered. The reason we keep the one-way hashed queries for 72 hours rather than dumping them immediately is so we can monitor and prevent “search fraud,” where a user does more searches than their normal activity.
Clear Gifs Information: When you use the Handylist.org website, we may employ clear gifs (a.k.a. web beacons), which are used to anonymously track the online usage patterns of users without collecting any personally identifiable information about you.
Clear gifs search query data, log information and cookies are non-personal information because such information is not collected or used in such a way that an individual user can be identified, for example, by name or email address.
We use non-personal information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your current or subsequent visits to the Handylist.org website; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors and traffic; (e) diagnose or fix technology problems; (f) access your information after you sign in; and (h) market our website to advertisers and other third parties.
