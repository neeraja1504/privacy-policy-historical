This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.
Security Access - KaboomIt has all usage and all object accesses audited continuously and will immediately cancel the offending account and will forward the issue to the appropriate authorities if, at KaboomIt's discretion, the attempt represents either a theft of electronic services or any type of other crime.
SSL - In order to protect electronic transactions, several security mechanisms have been proposed to deal with transferring information between computers in a secure manner. These security mechanisms attempt to insure that information such as credit card numbers can be sent without fear that someone else will intercept the data and look at it or alter it.
KaboomIt utilizes one such security protocol - Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Secure HTTP (S-HTTP). The SSL protocol has been developed by the Netscape Corporation. It provides a security layer throughout almost all layers of a network data transmission, so it can be used with FTP, Telnet, smtp, although it is most commonly used on a web page to accept data such as credit card numbers. We suggest that clients looking for security rely on this protocol to protect their web page communications.
KaboomIt, Inc. respects and encourages parents to monitor their children's use of the Internet as a whole, and KaboomIt in particular. We want parents to be able to share the KaboomIt experience with their entire families. Although we engage in strict data and posting integrity search routines, we realize that some information presented may not be suitable for children. We are making every effort to make this a family oriented site through this diligence.
