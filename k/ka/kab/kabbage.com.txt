IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING AN ACCOUNT
To help the government fight the funding of terrorism, money laundering activities and other financial crimes, federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each person who opens an account.
What this means for you: When you obtain a financial product or service offered by or in connection with our relationship with a financial institution, we may ask for your name, mailing address and other information or documentation, such as a copy of your driver’s license or other identifying documents, to verify your identity and otherwise comply with the applicable federal laws and regulations.
Information Collected
In connection with your use of the Services, we collect three types of information about you: Business Information, User Information, and General Information. Information from any of these categories may be linked with other information that we collect about you.
1.  _Business Information_. Business Information includes information regarding businesses that use or otherwise access the Services (“ _Customers_ ”).
