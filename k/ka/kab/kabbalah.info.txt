The Website uses both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies are used to make it easier for you to navigate the site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file.

Persistent cookies also enable Kabbalah.info to track and target the interests of users to enhance the experience on the site(s).
Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser settings to decline cookies or to notify you when a cookie is being placed on your computer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the features of the Website.
Our Website also may contain electronic images known as web beacons-sometimes called single-pixel gifs-that allow us to count the number of users who have visited those pages.
