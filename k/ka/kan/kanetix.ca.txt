The Kanetix.ca Privacy Policy
Your privacy and security
Our privacy pledge
Effective on January 17, 2018
Kanetix Ltd ("Kanetix")Â® believes in protecting the personal information that you provide us at www.kanetix.ca. We have made safe computing and the protection of your privacy an important priority. Kanetix provides insurance quotes/estimates with minimal personal information. Except where mandated by the government and its regulatory bodies or the courts, the personal information that you share with us will not be shared with third parties without your prior consent.
If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request.
Security
Entering personal data on Kanetix is not only easy but also safe. Kanetix uses an Apache server with SSL (Secure Socket Layer) protocol, among the best Internet security software in the world, and Entrust.net certificates for securing the exchange of confidential data. This security technology encrypts the personal information that you send us (including things like names, addresses, emails and telephone numbers), so it cannot be read by anyone as it travels over the Internet. We will evaluate and adopt new security technology as it becomes available.
You can find out when the secure SSL connection is activated by looking for the key or padlock icon in the lower corner of your browser window. If the key becomes whole, or the padlock becomes closed, this indicates that the browser is now in "secure" mode.
We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
If you have any questions about security on our website, you can send us an email.
Tracking Technologies
Kanetix and its partners use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, track users' movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functions on our website or service.
Log files
As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically. This information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, the files viewed on our site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data to analyze trends in the aggregate and administer the site.
Advertising
We partner with a third party to display advertising on our website or to manage our advertising on other sites, including ads pertaining to our clients' products. Our third party partners may use cookies or similar technologies in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to opt out of interest-based advertising, click here. Kanetix Ltd. participates in the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada's (the DAAC) self-regulatory principles for online behavioral advertising. You may also visit the AdChoices consumer opt out page to learn more about interest-based advertising and manage your ad preferences. Please note you will continue to receive generic ads.
Collecting information
We gather and store data about online usage on a collective rather than individual basis. For example, like most websites, we gather aggregate information about the number of visitors that visit our website and the pages that they view, NOT what pages were viewed by each individual. We use this information to anticipate bottlenecks, to gauge the capacity of our servers, and to improve the overall management of our website.
We also use Commission Junction to track visitors coming from our affiliate sites. This pixel tracking information helps determine the payments we are obliged to make to our affiliates for the traffic they send to us. We also use a third party tracking-utility company which uses pixel tracking to help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.
Please note that our online usage and affiliate tracking systems do not gather or store personal information.
Collecting personal identifiable information
In some provinces, Kanetix offers visitors the option of personalized quotes and gathers personal information as part of this process. Depending on the province, this may include obtaining your credit score from a credit reporting agency, or require you to provide details regarding your credit history. This information, along with the other details you enter will be used to provide you with a personalized offer and to determine the payment options that will be available to you.
Also, from time to time, Kanetix requests and collects personal information from visitors via surveys, contests, "Tell-a-friend" and Renewal Reminder services. Participation is completely voluntary (opt-in). Information requested has included your email address and that of the friend you are referring.
Finally, you can log in to our site using sign-in services such as Facebook Connect or an Open ID provider. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign up form. Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on this Web site to your profile page to share with others within your network.
Communication of personal Information
At various points on the Kanetix website and when visitors contact Kanetix, visitors may be asked if they consent to sharing their personal information with our affiliates and/or 3rd parties, only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy. If they agree, Kanetix provides one or more affiliates and/or 3rd parties with their personal information for the purposes of either preparing or validating an insurance quote or providing marketing services as explicitly requested by the visitor.
By submitting your question, comment or suggestion online the information you provide becomes the property of Kanetix. Where necessary, we may share the information you provide in your email with 3rd parties in order to address your question, comments or concerns. The content of your email may be used for any purpose and Kanetix is free to use any idea contained in it for any purpose whatsoever, including, but not limited to, developing, manufacturing and marketing products using such information.
Tell-a-friend
If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. Kanetix Ltd. does not store this information. Kanetix LTD uses this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.
What is this personal information used for?
Our surveys are used to identify consumer or improve visitor satisfaction with our site. The 'Tell-a-friend' service sends an email to a friend informing him/her about our site. With our Renewal Reminder service, visitors can elect to have an email reminder sent to them a month before their insurance policy expires.
We will use the email address you provide us to send you copies of the quotes you have requested to obtain a copy for your records.
Policy holder information
If you apply online for coverage or purchase a policy online through Kanetix, additional information is needed to process your request. This information may include your first and last name, email address, and dwelling address; your telephone number, driver's licence number, vehicle identification number (if purchasing auto insurance), your current insurance company, employer name and credit card number or bank account information. We may also need to obtain your credit score from a credit reporting agency, or require you to provide details regarding your credit history. This information, along with the other details you have provided will only be used to fulfill services you specifically request. They will not be used for any other reason.
We forward this information to the insurance company who will be reviewing your application or underwriting your policy. If you agree to purchase a policy from the insurance company, it may use your personal information for the purpose of fulfilling the requested insurance transaction and for future contact in accordance with the terms and conditions of its own privacy policy.
Framing
Some of our content is served on other pages using framing techniques to serve and provide our content and services on our partner's sites while preserving the look and feel of their site. Please be aware that you are providing your personal information to Kanetix for the services you are requesting and the use of your personal information is governed by this privacy policy.
Our select partners may also offer you the opportunity to opt-in to receiving information regarding their products and services. If you choose to receive these communications the information you provide is governed by their privacy policy.
Service providers
In some cases, we use third parties to provide the online quotes you receive on our site or to assist us in advertising our services to you. With respect to the quotes you get, the only information shared with the third party is the information required to provide you with an accurate quote. Depending on the type of quote you are seeking, this information may be comprised of one or more of the following: your age, gender, marital status, smoking status, driving, and insurance history. This information is only shared as necessary for the third party to provide you with an accurate quote.
We may also share your information with third parties who provide services on our behalf to help with our business activities. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.
These third parties are prohibited from using your personal information for any other purpose.
Testimonials
We post customer testimonials on our web site which may contain personal information. We do obtain the customer's consent via email prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial. If you want your testimonial removed please contact us.
How can you change your personal information?
Upon request, Kanetix will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information.

For your protection
Your password is your private, secret entry code to your account information at Kanetix. It is required when you first log in to view or to modify your saved information. Your password keeps your account information private and secure and you can change it as many times as you like.
Kanetix contains links to other websites. For example, you may find links to the suppliers featured in our comparison service or links to our affiliated brokerages. We do not exchange any information with these third-party sites if you click on them. If you do decide to click on one of these links, we encourage you to read the privacy statements of these linked sites as their policies may differ from ours.
Opting out
We provide you the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having your personal information used for certain purposes.

This information, along with the other details you enter will be used to provide you with a personalized offer and to determine the payment options that will be available to you. You can opt to not provide us with this permission and still get quotes.
Another example in how you can opt out involves our newsletter or renewal reminder service. If you sign up for these optional services we automatically send you a confirmation email specifying the services you requested. From these confirmation emails, you can opt-out of both of these services at any time by replying and indicating your preference to be removed from our lists. You can also opt-out by emailing us at unsubscribe@kanetix.ca, following the unsubscribe instructions in the email communications you receive, calling us at 1 (888) 854-2503 or by writing to us at 360 Adelaide Street West, Suite 100, Toronto, Ontario, M5V 1R7.
