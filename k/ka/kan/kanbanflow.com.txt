Personal data we collect and use
Name and email
To create an account we need your name and email address. They can be visible to other members of boards and organizations that you are or have been member of. Your name and email are used to identify your user in support errands. If needed you can change both from Account settings.
If you are mentioned inside a comment and want that name to be changed or removed, you agree that you will direct that request to the board owner.
Your email will also be used to send you notifications and newsletters. Notifications and newsletters can be toggled from Account settings > Configure notifications.
Uploaded images
You have the option to upload an avatar. The avatar can be visible to other members of boards and organizations that you are or have been member of. You can remove and change your avatar from Account settings.
Billing information
When you sign up for a premium subscription your billing information is needed. You may update your billing information under Subscription in your organization settings.
Location data
When you log in we automatically store your IP address so that you can identify and log out of other devices remotely. You can choose to log out of all or specific devices from Account settings > View login sessions.
We may also store your IP address in logs for security and debugging purposes. Those logs are automatically deleted on a regular basis.
Managing your personal data
Security
We take data security seriously and strive to follow best practices for securing your data. See Terms of Service for more information.
Some support requests may require access to your board or account. In most cases this is not necessary. Any information we see when helping you in the support request will not be disclosed by us to any external parties.
We may also require access to your account if we suspect that you are violating our terms by for example attempting to hack into the service or on purpose trying to overload or disrupt it.
Deletion
Deleting your account is a permanent action that can delete all personal data related to your account. You may accept that we can keep your full name when you delete your account. This can be helpful for other users when for example you have written comments or made changes on their boards. If you do not accept, your full name will be replaced with an anonymous text. See Storage for exceptions.
Storage
Normally, we will store your personal data no longer than 30 days after you delete your account. We may keep some of your information if necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to enforce our agreements or to support business operations.
Portability
To have all your data that we store sent to you, send us a request by email to portability@kanbanflow.com. We will respond with a link to download your data within two weeks.
Third parties
We do not sell or trade your personal data to outside parties. We do share some data with service providers for processing payments, sending emails, storing data and hosting our main and backup services. All third parties we share personal data with are compliant with GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation).
We may release your information when we believe it is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect our or others’ rights, property or safety.
Attaching files
In our premium version, you can attach files from Google Drive, Dropbox and Box to your tasks. To support that, you will be asked to give read-only permission to the service you use.
