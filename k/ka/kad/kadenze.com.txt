This notice describes Kadenze Inc.’s ("Company" or "Kadenze") privacy policy (referred to as "Privacy Policy" or "Policy") and applies to Company’s proprietary learning environment platform (referred to as the "PLE Service" or "KADENZE"). This Privacy Policy applies to you, as a User of the PLE Service and as an end user of the User Submissions provided by Users of the PLE Service.
PLEASE REVIEW THIS PRIVACY POLICY BEFORE USING THE PLE SERVICE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH OUR PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE PLE SERVICE. BY USING THE PLE SERVICE OR SUBMITTING ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION OR CONTENT TO THE PLE SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY. Your use of the PLE Service is also subject to the KADENZE Terms of Use. Please review the KADENZE Terms of Use, located at www.kadenze.com/terms_and_conditions for additional details regarding your use of the PLE Service. All capitalized terms have the same meaning as defined in the KADENZE Terms of Use unless otherwise stated herein.
Registration
During the registration process, you may be required to provide certain information and you will establish a username and a password. You agree to provide accurate, current and complete information during the registration process and to update such information to keep it accurate, current and complete. You agree not to share your password with any third party.
Protection of Minors
Company does not permit children under the age of 13 to register on the PLE Service or use any of its functionality for which registration is required. If you are between the age of 13 and 18 years old, you may use the PLE Service but only under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by the KADENZE Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy.
Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
PII is information that identifies you or can be used to identify, contact, or locate you. For the purpose of the Policy, PII is defined as your name, home or business address, email address, telephone number, and debit or credit card information such as the credit card number or billing address, social media links, personal websites, and grades/evaluations. Company respects your privacy. Company only collects PII through voluntary submissions, such as email, survey information, and online registration forms. The types and amount of PII collected from these activities will vary, but in no event will we collect PII that is not voluntarily given by you when using the PLE Service. You consent to Company using your PII to facilitate requests, to contact you if a problem arises, email you information about our PLE Service, or for other uses consistent with this Policy and your requests.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information (Non-PII)
Company collects statistical use data about your use of the PLE. This data does not identify you personally and is purely statistical data, such as monitoring website user traffic, and access patterns. This Non-PII is for your benefit, in order to improve the PLE Service. Such analysis and information is aggregated across viewers, does not identify anyone as an individual and does not link to any PII.
Sharing with Third Parties
Company does not share your PII with third parties without your consent except as provided in this Privacy Policy. It may be necessary to share your PII with our trusted business partners, who are bound to confidentiality. Should Company merge with or be acquired by another company, any information collected may be transferred to and used by the resulting company. If Company were to cease operations, your data might be transferred to and used by another company, which offers similar or related products. If such an event occurred, we would attempt to provide you with continuity of PLE Service.
The PLE Service gives you the ability to share your PII and other User Submissions with other PLE Users. Please consider carefully before disclosing any personal information or data that might be accessible to others.
Company may share Non-PII with third parties. Be assured that any Non-PII shared does not identify you personally.
Grades, Test Assessments and Evaluations
We know your grades, test assessments or evaluations are very important and private to you and we do not share that type of information with any third parties. All grades, test assessments and evaluations are treated as confidential, and such information is available only to the instructors assisting with the grading process and course administration and/or the university or college that is involved.
Third Party Links
We may display links, and Users may post links containing content of a third party service or PLE Service. You should always read the privacy policy of a third party service to find out more about how personal information is collected and processed. Company’s Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot fully control how, third parties use your information, and we cannot be held responsible for third parties’ use of your information.
Use of IP Addresses
As with any Internet-based service, queries to our PLE Service transmit an Internet Protocol (IP) address, as this is what allows delivery of the information you requested back to you. We also use IP addresses for security purposes and to determine the approximate geographic location (the country or metropolitan region) of the query. We do not use IP addresses to identify an individual user by name, address or exact location.
