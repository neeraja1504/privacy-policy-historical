Collected items may include the pages most frequently visited, services accessed the most, and links to other sites that users most often visit.  We measure activity in aggregate, such as number of users of our website, and activities conducted on our website, but may sometimes choose to measure use on an individual level. This allows us to provide a better user experience.
Kforce uses the information we collect for the following purposes: (1) to provide you with information regarding employment opportunities and career-related information; (2) establishing and maintaining communications with you; (3) where you have requested a service, assisting you in the completion of your application, the assessment of your eligibility for any such requested service, the processing and maintenance of the service, as well as any applicable renewal of such service; (4) responding to your inquiries about applications, accounts and other services; (5) making proposals for future service needs; (6) allowing our affiliated companies to notify you of certain products or services offered by our affiliated companies; (7) processing transactions through service providers; (8) complying with applicable legal requirements, court orders, legal proceedings, document requests, and industry standards and our policies; (9) protecting against fraud, suspicious or other illegal activities; (10) protecting the rights of Kforce or other third parties; and (11) compiling statistics for analysis of our sites and our business.

Kforce may disclose your Personal Information: (1) to third parties to perform business functions; (2) to our affiliated entities for the purposes of providing, marketing, or improving our services; (3) to comply with legal requirements, such as a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena or court order; (4) as part of a business transaction, such as a reorganization, merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, or similar event, or (5) in special cases, such as protecting the rights, property, or safety of Kforce, our customers or others.
Kforce may share your Personal Information with third parties or Kforce customers for employment, recruitment, and placement services, for potential employment opportunities with customers who are seeking employees who have your qualifications, or to a customer with whom you have been placed by Kforce, in order to integrate with their employment or application process.  Kforce may also share your information with third party service providers which are under contract to us, for the provision of the services for which you or one of our clients has contracted. These service providers have agreements with Kforce to handle your Personal Information the same way Kforce would. For example, Kforce uses analytics providers which track your use of the website or application. Kforce will only share Personal Information about you that is relevant to our legitimate business purposes or as stated in this Privacy Policy.
Additionally, this website uses the Google AdWords remarketing service to advertise on third party websites (including Google) to previous visitors to our site. It could mean that we advertise to previous visitors who haven’t completed a task on our site, for example using the contact form to make an inquiry. This could be in the form of an advertisement on the Google search results page, or a site in the Google Display Network. Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on someone’s past visits to the Kforce website. Of course, any data collected will be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy and Google’s privacy policy.
Linked Websites
Kforce’s website may contain links to third party websites not controlled by Kforce and therefore not covered by this Privacy Policy. Any information that you submit, post, or otherwise reveal on these third party sites is governed by the privacy policy of those sites.  We recommend that you review the terms and conditions of use and privacy policies in place on such third party websites.
Protecting Your Information
We want your information to remain as secure as reasonably possible. We regularly monitor industry-standard technical safeguards for securing your Personal Information and review our physical, technical, and organizational security practices to determine how we can prevent the loss, misuse, unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure of your Personal Information.  While we strive to protect your Personal Information, considering the nature of the Internet, and your control over your own access codes, Kforce cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us.

The major browsers have attempted to implement the draft “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) standard of the World Wide Web Consortium (“W3C”) in their latest releases. As this standard has not been finalized, Kforce’s website is not compatible with DNT and so does not recognize DNT settings.
Your California Privacy Rights
California Civil Code Section 1798.83 requires any operator of a website to permit its California-resident customers to request and obtain from the operator a list of what personal information the operator disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes, for the preceding calendar year; and the addresses and names of such third parties. Kforce does not share any personal information collected from this site with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.
