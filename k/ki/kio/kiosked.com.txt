KIOSKED PRIVACY POLICY STATEMENT | Kiosked
This document describes the role of Kiosked in ensuring data protection and privacy in its business and how we process personal data in our business.
Our Role in Ad Mediation Process
Kiosked is a technology provider enabling ad mediation between publishers and advertisers, i.e. connecting publishers’ online inventory and buyer side demand of advertisers. In its core Kiosked service is an intermediate technology provider serving both publishers and advertisers to execute optimised ad mediation process through its advanced online advertising technology.
Kiosked service dynamically creates and connects publishers’ inventory offering with advertisers’ demand on Kiosked marketplace in real-time-bidding environment. Kiosked acts as a data processor and processes personal data on behalf of data controllers (publishers, and in some cases advertisers or adnetworks). Kiosked enters into a separate data processing agreement (DPA) with the data controllers according to EU data protection laws, e.g. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
In some cases Kiosked may become a controller, or a joint-controller of personal data depending on contractual obligations between Kiosked and its advertising network and advertising partners. In such situations we may act as a data controller. We will in such situations collect and process personal data so that Kiosked can serve its customers and market its products and services. The collection and processing of personal data is always based on legislation, customer or service agreement, the legitimate interest of Kiosked or the consent of the data subject. We are happy to clarify which ground is applied in each situation.
As an intermediate technology provider Kiosked receives and processes, together with its sub-processors such as hosting partners and advertising networks, necessary personal data of the data subject, in order to be able to execute ad mediation. This data falls roughly into two categories: “HTTP header data” and “clickstream data” and it managed and processed according to IAB standards on real-time-bidding (RTB) ad mediation. The former data category may include information about browsers and devices of users, device identifiers, cookie information and the IP address from which the device accesses the service. The latter data category refers to the information that the data subject leaves behind while visiting a website and which stored as form of log files. No sensitive personal data, as defined by the GDPR, will be collected or processed by Kiosked.
Publishers as data controllers are obligated to collect and manage data subjects’ consent and/or a legal basis to process relevant personal data required to provide Kiosked service. To enable optimal performance and effective consent mechanisms Kiosked supports IAB consent framework (https://iabtechlab.com/standards/gdpr-transparency-and-consent-framework/) in its ad mediation data processing.
Opting Out of Behavioural Advertising
Kiosked advertising clients and partners may use behavioural elements, such as behavioural advertising to end users, in order to provide more relevant services and content to you. Such customized content may be tailored to you based on data we process on you as a part of our services to our partners.
Some of our advertising clients and partners are members of the Network Advertising Initiative and/or participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance Self-Regulatory Program. Both of them provide opt-out mechanisms for their respective members or participants. You can learn of your rights and your possibility to influence how data on your online activities are processed by going to http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp, http://www.aboutads.info/choices/, or http://www.youronlinechoices.eu (if you are located in the European Union). Note that the opt-out websites linked above may not reach all of our advertising partners and certain behaviourally targeted advertising may still be displayed to you. Also, note that opting out of behavioural advertising does not mean you will no longer receive online advertising. It means that the company from which you have opted out of receiving behavioural advertising will no longer deliver ads tailored to your web behaviour and usage patterns.
Some of our publisher clients have their own opt-out mechanisms that are linked to their sites or their online-posted privacy policies. You should review the privacy policies of those publishers and companies for these opt-out links if you no longer wish to receive targeted advertising from a particular company, or multiple companies.
