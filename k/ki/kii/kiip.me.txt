3. The Information We Collect via the Kiip Ad Platform
When you interact with a mobile application or website that has partnered with Kiip for the purpose of displaying advertisements within the app or site, we may collect a variety of information about your device and the Kiip ads that you view.
The publisher of the app or website that has partnered with Kiip is responsible for obtaining your consent, if required and as applicable, to enable us to collect information from your device.
The information we collect may include the following:
Information about your device. We may collect some or all of the following information about your device: device identifiers, which may include Mobile Android Advertising ID (ADID), iOS Advertising ID (IDFA), MAC address, International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI), or other unique device identifiers; device type (e.g., mobile, tablet); type and version of operating system (e.g., Android, iOS); network provider; IP address; mobile browser (e.g. Safari, Chrome, etc.); the carrier user ID (a number uniquely allocated to you by your network provider); timestamp; signal strength; API key (identifier for application); Publisher App version; manufacturer and device model; language setting; time zone; country; device language; DMA (Advertising Region); zip code; network status type (such as WiFi); list of installed apps (the applications and/or processes which are installed or run on your device while the Partner App is active or inactive); Kiip SDK version used by the Publisher.
Mobile Advertising Identifier (MAID) Definition: Most modern mobile devices (iOS 6, Android 2.3, and Windows 10 and above) provide mobile advertising identifiers. These are randomly-generated alphanumeric codes that are associated with your device that often come with options to reset the identifier and opt-out of Cross-App Advertising. These identifiers have different names depending on the operating system. For example, they are called Google Advertising ID (GAID) on Android devices whereas on iOS, they are called Identifiers for Advertisers (IDFA). They are included to provide advertisers a method to identify your devices without using a permanent device identifier, like your phone's serial number.
Precise Location Information. The Publisher may allow us to collect and process information about your mobile device’s GPS location (including the latitude, longitude, velocity, or altitude of your mobile device) and the time the location information was recorded. It is the responsibility of the Publisher to obtain your consent prior to the Publisher enabling collecting of such location data – please refer to the Publisher's privacy policy for more information.
You can stop the collection of this data at any time by disabling the GPS or other location-tracking functions on your device either generally or for that Partner App, provided your device allows you to do this.
To learn how to turn location services on or off at the app or device level in iOS, visit https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203033.
To learn how to turn location services on or off at the app or device level on Android, visit https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/3467281?hl=en.
Cookies and Related Tracking Technologies. When you use the Kiip Ad Platform, we may place and read cookies or access information on your device to obtain information about the performance of our advertising, to record your preferences, and to serve you with advertising that is relevant to your interests. This information may, where permitted by applicable law, then be combined with other information we hold about you.
Information about ads you view. We collect some or all of the following information about the ads you view: (i) what the ad is about; (ii) the ad type (e.g., text, image, or video); (iii) where the ad is displayed within the Publisher app or website; and (iv) certain information regarding what you do when interacting with or after viewing the ad (e.g., whether you proceed to purchase the product advertised). If the advertiser who created the ad ("Advertiser") uses one of our advertising solutions that involves the voluntary collection of information from you as part of the ad (for example, an ad that contains an Advertiser questionnaire or asks for your email address), and if we collect your voluntary responses, then your responses may be provided directly to the Advertiser and will be governed by the Advertiser's privacy policy.
Information about you from surveys. From time to time, we may display survey questions to you. These questions are completely voluntary to answer. If you do choose to answer these questions, we may collect, store, and share your responses and those responses may be tied to any or all of the data noted above including device information, precise location information, and information about the ads you viewed.
Information from our partners. Our Publishers and other third-party partners may sometimes disclose to us information they have separately collected about you so that we can improve the relevance of the ads we serve on their behalf. They do this in accordance with their own privacy policies and subject to their own applicable legal requirements.
4. How We Use the Information We Collect via the Kiip Ad Platform
We use the information we collect through the Kiip Ad Platform, where and as permitted by applicable law, to:
Display interest-based advertising customized to individuals’ inferred interests, preferences and locations, and to analyze the effectiveness of the ads.
We use this information to provide filtering options for Publishers to manage ads appearing in their apps and website, and to provide targeting options for Advertisers.
For example, we use this information to avoid presenting you with ads that you have already seen, and to help our Advertiser clients to serve ads that are more likely to be of interest to you.
Track your interaction with ads and to ensure you receive any rewards or offers you have earned via an ad engagement.
Respond to your customer support inquiries and to facilitate accurate resolution of any customer support problems that may arise.
Perform analysis and research aimed at improving our services.
Display contextual advertising (advertising based upon the context of the App).
Manage frequency capping of displayed ads (so you don't see the same ad multiple times), conversion tracking (so you can receive any reward earned by interacting with an ad), reporting, and security and fraud detection.
We keep this collected information as long as it remains necessary to provide the Kiip Services.
5. How We Share the Information We Collect via the Kiip Ad Platform

This may involve the sharing of your information with law enforcement, government agencies, courts, and/or other organizations.
Business Transaction. We may share your information in connection with any merger, reorganization, a sale of some or all Kiip assets, or a financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company.
Consent. We may share your information in any circumstances where we have your consent.

Third Party Online Analytics and Tailored Advertising Online Analytics. To help us better understand your use of the Kiip Web Services, we may use third-party web analytics providers, such as Google Analytics. These service providers use the sort of technology described in the "Cookies and Other Technologies" Section above.

To prevent Google Analytics from collecting or using your information, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on.

9. Kiip Cross Device Practices
Data collected from a particular browser or device may be used with another computer or device that is linked to the browser or device on which such data was collected, or transferred to a non-Affiliate for such purposes.
Data collected and used for cross device linking may include any or all of the Kiip Ad Platform and Kiip Web Services data points described in the sections above.

Further, Kiip will not use the data collected from any linked Device for use in IBA on the Device that has been opted-out. Please note, however, that opting-out for a particular Device does not opt you out from IBA on all other linked devices, and you must complete the opt out process for each Device separately.
10. Kiip General Privacy Practices
How We Secure Your Information: We have put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures designed to safeguard, and to help prevent unauthorized access to your information and to maintain data security. These safeguards take into account the sensitivity of the information that we collect, process and store and the current state of technology. Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, the Internet and the services are not 100% secure so we cannot assure you that information we collect or store will be protected from all unauthorized access.

Please check this page periodically for changes. Use of information we collect is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information was first collected. Please review the changes carefully. Your continued use of our services following the posting of changes to this Privacy Policy will mean you consent to and accept those changes.
Links to Third Party Sites and Services: Our services may contain links to third-party websites, including social media services. Your use of these features may result in the collection, processing or sharing of information about you, depending on the feature. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of other websites or services that may be linked on our services. We do not endorse or make any representations about third-party websites or services.

We will only use your email address for the purposes of communicating with you to resolve the issue.
If you have any questions or concerns regarding our privacy policies, please send us a message to privacy@kiip.me or mail us at Kiip, Inc., 970 Folsom Street, San Francisco, CA 94107, U.S., Attn: Privacy.
11. Opting Out of the Kiip Ad Platform
As described above, we use the information we collect when you use our Partner Apps or visit our website for purposes including, but not limited to, serving you with interest-based ads, offers, and rewards based on your inferred interests, preferences and location.
If you prefer not to receive ads, offers, or rewards that are tailored to your interests (Interest-based Advertising or IBA), you can opt out of Kiip in two ways:
When you receive an email from Kiip, you may opt out of receiving further emails by clicking on the 'unsubscribe' link in the footer of the email you received. This link will take you to a webpage where the only action that is required is to click 'Unsubscribe.'
To opt out of Kiip Interest-based Advertising (IBA), click or tap the 'Begin Opt Out' link below. Your Mobile Advertising ID will be automatically transferred to the Kiip Opt-Out page. All you need to do from there is click or tap submit. If your Mobile Advertising ID does not transfer or if you are entering it manually, you can find instructions below and on our Opt-Out page to help you identify it.
When you choose to Opt-out through the Kiip Opt-Out page, Kiip will no longer use data collected from that Device for use in Interest-based Advertising (IBA), on that Device or any linked Device. Further, Kiip will not use the data collected from any linked Device for use in IBA on the Device that has been opted-out.
Please note, however, that opting-out for a particular Device does not opt you out from IBA on all other linked devices, and you must complete the opt out process for each Device separately.
As an alternative to using the Kiip opt-out tool, you can also opt out of Kiip's IBA by changing your device's IBA opt-out setting. Instructions for doing so can be found at https://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choice.
In addition to using the above methods to opt out of Kiip IBA practices, you can opt out of other platforms by downloading the "AppChoices" mobile application from your App Store or via the Digital Advertising Alliance App Choices page at http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices.
Finding your Advertiser ID:
For iOS Devices, including iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch:
At present, the advertising ID on iOS devices is hidden from users by Apple by default but can be retrieved with third-party apps. Apple calls this identifier an "Identifier for Advertisers" or IDFA. An Apple IDFA is somewhat analogous to an advertising cookie, and enables advertisers to understand that a user of a particular phone has taken an action like a click or an app install.
In order to find your Apple IDFA, a third party tool is required. There is a wide selection of apps with the capability on the App Store. Below are a selection of apps for iOS that can show a device's IDFA to users.
My Device IDFA by AppsFlyer
Adjust Insights by Adjust
My TUNE Device by TUNE
For Android:
To find your Android Advertising Identifier, open the Google Settings app on your Android device and click on "Ads." Your Advertising Identifier will be listed at the bottom of the screen.
