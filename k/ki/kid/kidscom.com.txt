Idea Seeker Registration
Who needs to register?
Registration is not required to play on and explore much of KidsCom.com. Registering as an Idea Seeker Member or Ally is only required for kids who want to chat on KidsCom.com, adopt and care for a Plant Baby, explore many areas of the Idea Seeker Universe and be included in other special activities and promotions. KidsCom.com does not require, as a condition of participation, any Idea Seeker Member or Ally to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary for them to participate in an activity. A premium membership is available. This paid membership provides kids and parents with even more content and activity access.
What info is collected?
KidsCom.com is not permitted to collect more personal information than is reasonably necessary to permit a child to participate in activities on the site.
Message Boards - When a visitor to KidsCom.com wants to post something on the site (like on our monitored message boards or weekly creative writing challenges), we ask kids to provide info that is not personally identifiable (first name only, age and the country they live in). This information is included with their posted content and not used for any other purposes. All postings to KidsCom.com are screened by adult staff members before appearing on the site to help ensure children's online safety and privacy. Users are not allowed to post any personally identifiable information.
Registered Idea Seeker Member or Ally - When a kid wants to become a registered Idea Seeker Member or Ally, we ask for the following information:
Child's first name and screen name
Child's date of birth
Child's gender
Child's country
This information is requested regardless of the age of the child. If kids would like to participate in Friend-to-Friend Messaging, it is required that they print out the registration form, have their parent or guardian sign it, and then mail or fax it to us as verification of parental consent to participate in this activity.
KidsCom.com uses this information to create and maintain separate Idea Seeker Ally and Member registration records for each child. Date of birth, gender, city state, zip code and country are collected to help us develop the most appropriate content for our visitors.
We encourage parents to be involved with all of their child's online activities.
On the page where a kid or parent can update a kid's registration information, kids can voluntarily indicate how they learned of KidsCom.com by clicking one of seven choices: A friend, A parent, A search engine, A link from another site, A teacher, Surfing the Web, Some other way. We use this information to help guide our efforts to let more kids, parents and teachers know about KidsCom.com. Thy can also provide their city and state, which we use if we host real world events in specific locations.
Newsletter - When a kid wants to sign up to be on our mailing list for regular e-mail newsletter updates, we ask them to provide their e-mail address and their parent/guardian's e-mail address. We send an e-mail to the child's e-mail address and ask them to confirm the e-mail address before we add them to the mailing list. We send an e-mail to the parent/guardian's e-mail address to notify them that we will be sending regular updates to their child. The parent/guardian has the option of removing their child's e-mail address from the mailing list. The child's e-mail address is not associated with any of their registration information. Kids do not need to be a registered Idea Seeker member or Ally to sign up for the newsletter mailing list.
All personal information collected on KidsCom.com is done so directly from the parent or child. No personal information is collected from users through cookies or other passive means.
The KidsCom.com site may contain links to sites of sponsors and advertisers whose privacy policy and practices are different than our own. It is important for KidsCom.com visitors to always review a site's privacy policy before releasing any personal information. This includes content and promotions featured on the KidsCom.com site.
KidsCom.com uses every means available to safeguard the personal information of our Idea Seeker Members, Allies and site visitors, including a secure physical location and a protected electronic environment.
What areas on KidsCom.com require Idea Seeker or Ally registration?
Idea Seeker Universe Chat - Kids can chat in the Idea Seeker Universe using our Keep it Safe, Keep it Clean Dictionary or pre-set phrases. KidsCom.com's staff of trained adult chat monitors reviews the chat to ensure that the rules are being followed. Private messaging between kids is not allowed. Idea Seeker Members or Allies are not permitted to share any information that will personally identify them. Idea Seeker Member or Ally registration is required to enable us to enforce the chat rules.
Idea Seeker Plant Babiesâ„¢ - Registered kids can sprout and care for their very own Idea Seeker Plant Babies. Kids earn Virtual Points by playing certain educational games and fun activities on the KidsCom.com site. Kids then use their Virtual Points to take care of the needs of their Plant Babies. To allow kids of all ages to participate, different Plant Babies require different levels of skill, care and attention. Idea Seeker Plant Babies help kids fight the Darkness of Dumbness and the Clouds of Chaos. Idea Seeker Member or Ally registration is required for earning Virtual Points so we can accurately track each child's point totals.
Friend-to-Friend Messaging- Friend-to-Friend messaging allows Idea Seekers (paid members) to send private messages to other kids on their Friends List. Only Idea Seekers with a parent's permission can participate in this program. The messages can only include words from our Keep it Safe, Keep it Clean Dictionary, but we still strongly encourage parents to monitor their child's messages. Idea Seeker registration is required to ensure that each child has parental permission.
Tell-A-Friend Messaging
There are several places on KidsCom where kids can send an e-mail to a friend telling them about the site. The Tell-A-Friend form asks for the sender's first name and their friend's first name and e-mail address. The e-mail address is used only to send an e-mail with information about KidsCom to the friend. It is not stored by KidsCom or used for any other purpose.
