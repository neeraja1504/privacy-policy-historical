Who do we collect personally identifiable information from ? - Information collected on this site,     Minors, Adults, Security, E-commerce, General Conditions
Children and parents, take careful note of the following information:
Parental consent and the UpToTen User Account
In compliance with COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act) and all European legislation currently in force, only the parents and legal guardians are permitted to give personally identifiable information concerning of child 12 and under: To comply with these laws, we have created the UpToTen User Account.
Through the UpToTen User Account, the child's parent or legal guardian can send all the information concerning their child(ren) that is necessary for the subscription process. The information we ask for allows us to deliver a personalized and fulfilling experience for club members.
Through the UpToTen User Account, the child's parent or legal guardian has immediate access to and complete control over the personally identifiable information UpToTen holds concerning them. The parent / guardian can modify or delete that information at any time through the UpToTen User Account.
What sort of information is collected by this site ?
This site is home to a multitude of activities, games and services for both parents and children.
Only children accompanied by an adult can access UpToTen Kids. We ask the parent or guardian to identify themselves and to open a free UpToTen User Account before we allow access to the child. Some of the data collected is personally identifiable information (first and last names, professional or home address, email address...), and some is not ( gender, age, browser used on the PC...)
We collect personally identifiable information concerning the parent or guardian during the sign-up process. For the Boowa and Kwala club, we require personally identifiable information about the child. The inscription for the Club can only be completed via a valid UpToTen User Account. The data we collect concerning children under the age of 13 is therefore provided by their parent or guardian (in compliance with COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act) and all European legislation currently in force).
The following text aims to clearly state UpToTen's policy concerning personal data collected on the site. We will explain how the information is collected and for what reasons.
UpToTen does not sell, exchange or broadcast publicly information provided by users without their consent and this in strict accordance with the relevant applicable laws (the COPPA, for example). UpToTen respects the concerns and private lives of its visitors and their families. All information given remains the sole property of UpToTen.
UpToTen will partner with commercial institutions in order to offer club members and UpToTen User Account holders quality products and services. Unless otherwise stated, adhesion to UpToTen via a Boowa & Kwala Club membership or an UpToTen User Account gives the adherent access to direct promotion for UpToTen products and those of carefully chosen partners.
Our partners' products will be recommended by Boowa and Kwala and will therefore be quality, well-known brands that are suitable for Boowa and Kwala fans.
