We also note the following details regarding how we process your information:
Technologies such as: cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by KidKraft, Inc. and analytics service providers. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the Site, tracking users’ movements around the Site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregate basis.
• Log Files. Any time you visit any of our Site, our servers automatically gather information from your browser (such as your IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks) to analyse trends, administer the Site, prevent fraud, track visitor movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information. For example, we may log your IP address for system administration purposes. IP addresses are logged to track a user’s session. This gives us an idea of which parts of our Site users are visiting. We do not share the log files externally.
• Cookies. We use “cookies” to keep track of some types of information while you are visiting our Site or using our Services. Cookies are very small files placed on your computer, and they allow us to count the number of visitors to our Site and distinguish repeat visitors from new visitors. They also allow us to store passwords and user preferences and to track user trends. We rely on cookies for the proper operation of our Site; therefore if your browser is set to reject all cookies, the Site will not function properly. Users who refuse cookies assume all responsibility for any resulting loss of functionality. We do not link the cookies to any personally identifiable information.
• Web Beacons. “Web beacons” (also known as “clear gifs” and “pixel tags”) are small transparent graphic images that are often used in conjunction with cookies in order to further personalize our Site for our users and to collect a limited set of information about our visitors. We may also use web beacons in e-mail communications in order to understand the behavior of our customers. We do not link the web beacons to any personally identifiable information.
Personally Identifiable Information About You. When you visit our Site or use our Services, we may collect the abovementioned personally identifiable information about you. Your responses to any of our questions about you will be kept strictly confidential, while other personally identifiable information about yourself (such as first and last name, address, etc.) may be used to build your profile. Finally, for interactive content and Services such as the KidKraft Blog, where you may choose to have a public profile, we may display your personally identifiable information to other community members and visitors. You may choose to provide us with your photo(s) or video(s) and by providing us such content, you agree that we may make them available to users of KidKraft’s Site or KidKraft’s blog, including without limitation, if you are selected as the winner of any promotion.

If you are concerned that your personally identifiable information is incorrect, please contact as detailed below.
• Purchase Information. To process purchases, we may require your name, address, phone number, e-mail address and credit card information. Such personally identifiable information is used primarily to process your order or as otherwise described herein. Credit card transactions are processed through industry standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and/or strong encryption (3DES) by a third party, which only uses your personally identifiable information for that purpose.
• E-mails And Telephone Calls. We require an e-mail address from you when you register for our Services. We use your e-mail for both transactional (e.g., order confirmation, refund and renewal processing) and promotional (e.g., newsletters, new product offerings, special discounts, event notifications, special third-party offers) purposes. E-mail messages we send you may contain code that enables our database to track your usage of the e-mails, including whether the e-mail was opened and what links (if any) were clicked. If you would rather not receive promotional e-mails from us, please see the section below labelled Opt-Out of Our Email Communications. Please note that even if you opt-out of receiving marketing communications from us, we may need to send you certain service-related communications relating to KidKraft goods and Services, such as product recall information. In accordance with applicable law, we may also contact you by telephone or text message (including to any wireless number you may provide to us) solely in connection with KidKraft’s Services. If you would rather not continue to receive telephone calls or text messages from us, you may change or delete your number from your account preferences page(s) or ask to be removed from our contact list by contacting us as detailed below, making the request during any telephone call, or sending "STOP" to any text message received from us.

We do not link the survey responses to any personally identifiable information, and all responses are anonymous.

Disclosure Of Your Information To Third Parties
We will only share your information with third parties in the ways defined in this privacy policy.
• Disclosure By Law. You acknowledge and agree that we may disclose information you provide if required to do so by law, at the request of a third party, or if we, in our sole discretion, believe that disclosure is reasonable to (1) comply with the law, requests or orders from law enforcement, or any legal process, such as a subpoena (whether or not such disclosure is required by applicable law); (2) protect or defend KidKraft’s, or a third party’s, rights or property; or (3) protect someone’s health or safety, such as when harm or violence against any person (including you) is threatened.
• Disclosure To Trusted Third Parties By Us. We may share your non-personally identifiable information with third parties, in a manner that would not reveal your identity. We may share your personally identifiable information, sometimes in conjunction with your non-personally identifiable information, with service providers that may be associated with us to perform functions on our behalf. For example, outsourced EDI (electronic data interchange) representatives may need access to your information to perform Services for you. Your information will be treated as private and confidential by such service providers and not used for any other purpose than we authorize. In addition, from time to time, we may share personally identifiable information (such as e-mail or mailing address) about our user base with carefully selected third parties, so they can offer goods and services that we believe may be of interest to our users.
As required by applicable law, if you do not wish to receive offers from our trusted partners, please opt out by clicking below: Please do not share personally identifiable information about me with KidKraft's trusted partners for their direct marketing purposes.
• Disclosure to Trusted Third Parties at Your Request. When visiting our Site, we may provide you with advertisements, promotions, sweepstakes and offers from third party providers. If you choose to accept any such offers, you may either (depending on the situation) directly provide your information in connection with the offer to such third party provider, or we will provide your information, including billing information, to the third party provider by pre-populating the offer registration forms. Your information will not be transferred until you actually accept the offer. You may opt-out of the offer at any time up until this point. Please refer to the third party provider’s own privacy policy (provided on the offer pages) if you have any questions regarding how your information is used by such providers. Please be aware that these offers may be presented on pages framed by a KidKraft website. Although these offer pages may have the look and feel of our Site, you will be submitting your information directly to the third-party advertiser. You agree that to the extent permitted by applicable law, we will not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings, including the sharing of the information you supply to us with third party providers described here, or as the result of the presence of such providers on the KidKraft Site.

If this occurs, you will be notified if there are any material changes to the way your information is collected or used.
