Kboards Privacy Policy
Commitment to Privacy
KBoards is committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected while you're here at the KBoards website.

You provide your email address when you register in our forums. That email address is used to confirm your registration, and to receive alerts regarding Personal Messages (PMs) sent to you through our PM system, and any thread updates that you choose to be notified with through the NOTIFY button at the top of each thread.
By default, your email address is hidden from all forum members except our moderators. If you wish it to be viewable in the forums, you will have to go your forum Profile Page and adjust the Hide Email Address setting.
We have never sold or given away the email addresses of our members, and never will.
