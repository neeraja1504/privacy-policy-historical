About Kindsafe.com
Kindsafe's mission is to search for websites which might be potentially harmful to family safety. A non-safe content specification may include writing or promoting adult content, hazard, violence, or another type of content that may, for example, cause damage to your computer (warez).
How do we check for bad content?
Our company has developed own algorithms which regularly crawl a large number of domains, and check for bad content (keywords, links to bad neighbors and so on). If we find out that a significant part of the page is related to unsafe content, we mark that site as non-family safe.
Why do we do it?
Because we have children and we have encountered a huge lot of websites we definitelly do not want our children to visit.
How can I help?
It's easy. Submit your reviews for a website you know - this will help us to make a better image of every website we display information about. Install our plugin for marking websites, or use our API and mention us on your website.
