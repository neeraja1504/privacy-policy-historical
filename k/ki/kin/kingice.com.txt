You should feel as comfortable using your credit card online as you do in a department store.

The standard, unsecured URL address begins "http://". When you enter a secure area, the beginning of the URL address will change to "https://"; the "s" stands for secure. Most browsers in secure mode also display a blue line along the top of the browser window.
Entering a "Secure Area"
Your computer and our server begin to communicate in a secure area, sending data back and forth in an encrypted format. Browser encryption software is quite powerful and ensures the security of this data as it is transmitted to our server.
