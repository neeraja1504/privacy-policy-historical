However, we have put in place protections to ensure that your information is adequately protected. If you wish to know more about the protection we have put in place to keep your information safe, please contact our Data Controllers.
Where organisations outside of Kingspan provide you with a service on our behalf, or help us provide the service to you (e.g. sending you a piece of literature that you have requested from us or helping us respond to your request regarding the technical operation of the website), we may share your personal information with those organisations who will only use the information to provide the relevant service.
