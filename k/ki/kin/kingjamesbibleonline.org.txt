Will I be automatically added to an email subscription list?
No. No one is added to any list without authorization. We have a NO-SPAM rule with zero tolerance for spam. No spam has ever been sent or will ever be sent, and none is permitted to be received. It is against our policies to falsify and report emails as spam that are not spam.
You may actively choose to subscribe to Bible comment threads. At times, this may trigger an email notification to be sent to subscribers if someone updates a comment on the subscribed thread. A Bible-in-a-Year reading program is also available via email for subscribers. Interested parties subscribe themselves, by entering their email and clicking the subscribe button, and remove themselves from clicking a single link at the bottom of any one of the daily emails. This is a free service and contains no commercial solicitations- only Bible scripture.
