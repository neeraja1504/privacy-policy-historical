We take all reasonable precautions to safeguard your private information through security policies and secure server technologies (details provided later in this document).

Secured server communications
All sensitive data transmission to and from our secure server is protected by whats known as the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) 256 bit encryption which is the strongest commercial encryption available. In the unlikely case the information is intercepted, it will remain unusable as the data remains encrypted and scrambled. With this security, you can transmit your credit card details to us without risk of interception. In fact, SSL security makes shopping over the Internet much safer than shopping by telephone. As an additional security measure, no record of sensitive data, such as credit card number, is ever stored in our database. Hence, no unauthorised person can ever retrieve your card details from our secured website.
What you can do to reinforce security of your information

Never disclose your password - It is important that you do not disclose your password to any third party. If you are concerned that somebody else knows your password, you may alter your password anytime in theMy Account section of the website.
