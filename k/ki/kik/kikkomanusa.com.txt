(“Kikkoman”, “we” or “us”), the operator of this Site, is committed to protecting and safeguarding your privacy. This document will outline how we gather and utilize various sources of information obtained during your visit to the Site. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected at this Site. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to let us know. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR OTHERWISE USE THE SITE.
Personal and Non-Personal Information:
When using the Site, in order to utilize some of the services, you may be asked to provide, or you may choose to upload, certain personally identifiable information about yourself ("Personal Information"). Personal Information can include your name, birth date, gender, email address, physical address, telephone number or other information you may provide. Similarly, when you post a photograph, enter or respond to a contest, survey, sweepstakes or other promotional feature, we may ask you for your name, physical address, email address or other Personal Information.
In addition, we may also collect non-personally identifiable information, such as IP host address, pages viewed, browser type, duration and frequency of visits, and other data, and may aggregate any information collected in a manner which does not identify any individual ("Aggregate Information"). We obtain Aggregate Information from our Site logs which we analyze to improve the quality and value of the materials available on our Site. Our Site logs are not personally identifiable, and we make no attempt to link them with the individuals who actually browse the Site. This means that, in general, you can visit our Site without telling us who you are or revealing Personal Information about yourself, in which case you may, however, be unable to participate in certain promotions or receive product information.
Information obtained in connection with the Site may be intermingled with and used by us in conjunction with information obtained through sources other than the Site, including both offline and online sources.

We do not sell your Personal Information to third parties or mass marketers. For example, we will not sell another company your name or email address. Unless you consent to the disclosure of your Personal Information, only we and our affiliates, our technical consultants, third party auditors and other third parties who make our Site available, enhance its functionality, or provide associated services and/or who deal with you in delivering content, samples, products, gifts and prizes, have access to this information, and we require them to agree that they are covered by this policy.
