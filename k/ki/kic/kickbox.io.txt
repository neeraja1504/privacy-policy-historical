Thank you for taking the time to read our privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”). At Kickbox, your privacy is of the utmost importance. We want you to be fully informed about the information we collect, how it is used, shared, and protected, and the choices you have with it.
The following explains the privacy and data practices at Kickbox, Inc. (“Kickbox”, “We”, “Us”, or “Our”). This Privacy Policy is provided to inform you of our policies and practices and of the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and how that information is used.
Should you ever have any questions specific to our Privacy Policy, you may contact the Kickbox Privacy Office at privacy@kickbox.com
Kickbox complies with global privacy regulations
Your personal information is our responsibility while under our control
We may transfer your data to approved third party service providers for the purposes of rendering or securing Service to you.
You may contact Kickbox anytime with your privacy questions or concerns: privacy@kickbox.com
Kickbox Inc. complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield. Kickbox has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to such data. If there is any conflict between the policies in this privacy policy and data subject rights under the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/
With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks, Kickbox is subject to the regulatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.
Pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks, EU individuals have the right to obtain our confirmation of whether we maintain personal information relating to you in the United States. Upon request, we will provide you with access to the personal information that we hold about you. You may also correct, amend, or delete the personal information we hold about you. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data transferred to the United States under Privacy Shield, should direct their query to privacy@kickbox.com. If requested to remove data, we will respond within a reasonable timeframe.
We will provide an individual opt-out choice, or opt-in for sensitive data, before we share your data with third parties other than our agents, or before we use it for a purpose other than which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized. To request to limit the use and disclosure of your personal information, please submit a written request to privacy@kickbox.com.
In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
Kickbox’s accountability for personal data that it receives in the United States under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to a third party is described in the Privacy Shield Principles. In particular, Kickbox remains responsible and liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if third-party agents that it engages to process personal data on its behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless Kickbox proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Kickbox commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield. European Union individuals with Privacy Shield inquiries or complaints should first contact us by email at privacy@kickbox.com.
Kickbox has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the Privacy Shield Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit http://www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers for more information and to file a complaint. This service is provided free of charge to you.
If your complaint involves human resources data transferred to the United States from the EU in the context of the employment relationship, and Kickbox does not address it satisfactorily, Kickbox commits to cooperate with the panel established by the EU data protection authorities (DPA Panel), as applicable and to comply with the advice given by the DPA panel, as applicable with regard to such human resources data. To pursue an unresolved human resources complaint, you should contact the state or national data protection or labor authority in the appropriate jurisdiction. Complaints related to human resources data should not be addressed to the BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD.
Contact details for the EU data protection authorities can be found at https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en.
If your Privacy Shield complaint cannot be resolved through the above channels, under certain conditions, you may invoke binding arbitration for some residual claims not resolved by other redress mechanisms. See Privacy Shield Annex 1 at https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-introduction.
You may contact Kickbox anytime with your privacy questions or concerns: privacy@kickbox.com.
Kickbox is committed to protecting user personal information and complying with global privacy regulations. When data is exported outside of the EEA/EU to a country that has not been deemed to have standard and default adequate privacy protections, the European Commission requires additional measures to ensure adequate protection of personal information.
Kickbox provides technology to support opt-in compliant email address collection
We offer several products or services to our users
Kickbox’s mission is to help make email a better experience for everyone. Our services promote permissive, opt-in email address collection practices for businesses and email marketers, which helps to mitigate the amount of unsolicited email (spam) that is sent.
The products and services of Kickbox include Email Verification (“Verification”), Trustkit (“Trustkit”), or other services (collectively, the “Service”), and the data we collect about your usage, will adhere to this Privacy Policy. We operate and own the websites https://kickbox.com and https://trustkit.com (“Sites”).
Through the Sites, we provide services that can help ensure an individual’s email address they use for opt-in email marketing campaigns is valid, high quality, and one they actually own and your website is protected from fake or misleading account signups.
We collect non-personal information when you use the Service
This data is used to monitor, render, or secure the Service or to create anonymized data products
If we combine personal information with non-personal information, it will be treated as personal information
We collect non-personal information − data in a form that does not permit direct association with any specific individual – and personal information automatically when you access and use the Service. For example, when you use the Service, we may collect data about your Service requests such as IP addresses, date/time stamps, and the email address you submit for processing.
We collect this data to monitor, secure, and render Service to you, develop new products or services, for support or troubleshooting any problems you may encounter with the Service, or to develop anonymized data products (“anonymized data products”). If we do disclose such data, all identifiable personal information will be removed or obfuscated prior to any such disclosure.
If we do combine non-personal information with personal information the combined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined. We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information, including anonymized data products, for any purpose.
The information we collect is only used for the purposes defined in this policy
You are only required to submit personal information to us when creating an account for Service
Any information provided to us through the Service will be retained and used for the purposes of fulfilling your request for information, fulfilling a request through a Site or Service feature, performing and carrying out the Terms of the Service, performing or improving our Service, developing a new Service, communicating with you as a user of Kickbox’s services or as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.
Trustkit collects information such as IP address, browser type, device type, and general location from individuals submitting their email address to create an account with one of our customers’ applications (“End User”) that uses Trustkit. Kickbox uses this information to provide services to our customers and the collection of End User data is subject to the Privacy Policy of our customers’ website(s) and not Our Sites. For inquiries pertaining to data privacy or collection through Trustkit, you will need to contact that Data Controller, our customer, directly.
Simply viewing the Sites does not require registration. If you choose to utilize the Service, you must create an account. Setting up an account requires you to provide your first and last name, a verifiable email address and a passphrase ("Account Data"). Kickbox uses this information to identify you as an authorized user. This Account Data is stored on our secure servers.
You can review, modify, or request to delete personal information by contacting Kickbox
Upon request Kickbox will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information. If your personal information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, delete or ask to have it removed by contacting the Kickbox Privacy Office by emailing us at privacy@kickbox.com or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below. If you no longer desire our service, contact us directly. We will respond to your request to access within a reasonable timeframe.
We retain personal information for as long as is needed to render our Service to you
Reasonable effort will be given to fulfilling privacy requests sent to privacy@kickbox.com
When we collect your personal information (including geolocation data), we will retain it as long as your account in the relevant Service remains enabled, unless applicable law requires otherwise. However, we will make good faith efforts to delete your personal information if you contact us by following the instructions at the beginning and at the end of this Privacy Policy, provided that we are not required to retain it by law or for legitimate business purposes. We may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, are extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required by local law. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services contact the Kickbox Privacy Office by emailing us at privacy@kickbox.com.

Kickbox may have to disclose information to third parties when required by law or under the good-faith belief that such disclosure is necessary in order to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, or to comply with legal process served on Kickbox.

These service providers are not permitted to collect, retain, or use your information for any other purpose. If you want a listing of third parties, please email us at privacy@kickbox.com.
Kickbox may disclose or transfer your Account Data, Service Metadata, or log files (1) to its corporate affiliates (for example its subsidiaries or parent corporation), (2) to its service providers (like hosting services), but only for their use to provide services to Kickbox, or (3) to an acquirer in connection with the sale of the business or assets of Kickbox. Kickbox will require its corporate affiliates and service providers that receive Account Data or Service Metadata to limit their use and disclosure of your information to the purposes for which you provided it.

Kickbox uses third party service providers to prevent fraudulent and abusive activity

These automated systems gather information about you upon visiting our website, interacting with our Service, and communicating with Kickbox. The information we collect may include your IP address, geographic location, a unique device ID, and your Account Data.
This data is never used for purposes outside of Kickbox’s Safety & Compliance processes.

Kickbox limits access to systems and data based on job responsibilities (principle of least privilege)
Many functions or features are operated by automated processes
Data transmission and storage adheres to, and in many cases exceeds, information security best practices
Kickbox limits access to Account Data, Service Metadata, or log files to Kickbox personnel and service providers who require that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs. We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. Information we collect is stored in a secure manner that is only accessible by authorized Kickbox personnel or service providers and is only disclosed under the provisions of this Privacy Policy. Our servers are located in the U.S.A.
Users log into the Service using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). Passwords are encrypted before they are transmitted and are stored encrypted.
Services are performed by automatic processes. Kickbox employees do not examine the contents of customer Service data except when Kickbox in its sole discretion determines that it is required to address an issue with the Service, by law or government agency, or as permitted by the customer. When you upload an email address list or import an integration list to our Service the list data and Verification data is transmitted to Amazon's S3 service for storage.
For all data security inquiries, or to report a security incident, you may contact Kickbox at security@kickbox.com.
Protecting the security of your personal information is very important to us. When we store information that you have provided to us when registering for the Service, that information is protected by security measures that include “firewalls” (a combination of computer hardware and software that helps keep unauthorized visitors from accessing information within our computer network), “intrusion detection systems” (a combination of computer hardware and software that helps detect any unauthorized visitors) and other tools such as data encryption and physical security, where appropriate. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or data repository can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while Kickbox strives to protect your personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us online and cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your personal information.
Kickbox does not knowingly collect, process, or retain the data or personal information of children under the age of 13

We may link you to third party websites from time to time
Other websites are not under our control and may treat your personal information differently
This Privacy Policy applies only to our Sites
Please be aware that when you are on the Sites, or when you receive an email message from us through the Service, you could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. There may be links to other sites from our Sites' pages or from the email message we send to you that take you outside our Sites. These other sites may send their own cookies to visitors, collect data, or solicit personal information.

We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these other sites and cannot guarantee the security of any of your personal information collected there.

Your information is considered a business asset when rendering Service to you
Kickbox may transfer all or part of its assets to an acquirer as part of an asset transfer
You will be notified in the event of a Change of Control or Asset Transfer
As Kickbox develops, we may buy other businesses or their assets or sell all or parts of our business assets. Customer information is generally one of the business assets involved in such transactions. Thus, in the event that the assets of Kickbox in whole or in parts are acquired by a third-party, customer information, including any visitor information collected through the Sites or the Service, would be one of the transferred assets. In the event of a corporate change in control or sale of all or parts of our business assets our users will be notified in accordance with the “Changes to this Privacy Policy” section of the policy if their personal information is provided to the new corporate entity or asset purchaser.
Kickbox may process your data even if you are not a customer of ours
Any privacy concerns would need to be directed to the entity transfering your data to us
Kickbox collects information under the direction of its Clients, and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes. If you are a customer of one of our Clients and would no longer like to be contacted by one of our Clients that use our service, please contact the Client that you interact with directly. We may transfer personal information to companies that help us provide our service. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our Clients.
Access or changes to your information provided to us by our customers, must be resolved with our customers directly
Kickbox acknowledges that you have the right to access your personal information. Kickbox has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct his query to the Kickbox’s Client (the data controller). If requested to remove data we will respond within 30 business days.
We will retain personal data we process on behalf of our Clients for as long as needed to provide services to our Client. Kickbox will retain this personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
Kickbox may change this policy at any time
We will notify you of changes within this policy and you may choose to opt-out
Kickbox reserves the right, at its discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions from this policy at any time by posting such changes here. Users should review this policy regularly for changes, and can easily see if changes have been made by checking the Effective Date above or below. However, if at any time in the future Kickbox plans to use personal information in a way that differs from this policy, Kickbox will post such changes here and provide you with the opportunity to opt-out of such differing uses prior to the change becoming effective. Your continued use following the posting of any changes to this policy means acceptance of such changes.
