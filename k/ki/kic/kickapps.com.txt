Privacy Policy Page
Your privacy on our site
The primary purpose of our site is to be a resource and business tool to help you learn more about Perfect Sense Digital. We want you to feel secure when visiting our site and are committed to maintaining your privacy when doing so. Any changes we may make to our privacy policy in the future will be posted on this page.
What information do we gather?
Perfect Sense only collects information in one way, directly. For example, when you provide information to apply for a job.
We may collect and process the following information:
Information that you provide by filling in forms on our site. This includes registering to apply for a job. Pages that collect this type of information may provide further information as to why your data is needed and how it will be used. It is completely up to you whether you want to provide it.
If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence.
Our site collects information about your computer, including (where available) your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration, to filter traffic, to look up user domains and to report on statistics.
Details of your visits to our site and resources you access (including but not limited to, traffic data, location data, weblogs and other communication data). Please see the Cookies section below for more information.
When this information relates to or identifies you, we will treat it as “personal data”.
Will we share your personal data with outside parties?
We will not sell personal data to third parties.
What about data security?
We take appropriate steps to maintain the security of personal data collected via our site. You should understand that the open nature of the Internet is such that information and personal data may flow over networks connecting you to our systems without security measures and may be accessed and used by people other than those for whom the data is intended.
Our site may, from time to time, contain links to and from the sites of our partner networks, advertisers and affiliates. If you follow a link to any of these sites, please note that these sites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies or sites. Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these sites.
Your rights
You are entitled to know whether we hold personal data about you and, if we do, to have access to that personal data and require it to be corrected if it is inaccurate. You can do this by using our Contact Us address.
Do you use cookies?
We do not use cookies.
Apart from ShareThis, at Perfect Sense we do not have third party advertising on our site so we do not use targeting cookies.
Third party social media sites may log information about you, for example if you click an “Add This” or “Like” button for a social media site while on our site. We do not control such sites or their activities. You may be able to find information about social media sites on the sites themselves. We recommend you read the terms of use and privacy policy of such sites before using them.
If you have any questions now or during your visit, please contact us using our Contact Us form.
