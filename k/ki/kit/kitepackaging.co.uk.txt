If you are a new customer, you can opt out of email communications at the new customer billing stage of the basket. This will ensure we do not send you promotional material via email.
We will never share your name and contact details with 3rd parties for marketing purposes. We do use 3rd party service providers to send out marketing material but only allow them to use that information on our instructions and where they have agreed to treat the information confidentially and to comply with data protection legislation.
