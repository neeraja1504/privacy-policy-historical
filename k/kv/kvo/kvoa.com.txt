Privacy Policy | KVOA.com
Welcome to the website for KVOA.com (the “Site”). This Site is owned by Cordillera Communications (“Cordillera Communications” or “us”) and powered by Synapse Multimedia. We at Cordillera Communications recognize that many visitors to our website are concerned about the information that they provide to us or that may be collected, and how we treat that information. In order to address those concerns we have developed this Website Privacy Statement.
A. TYPES OF INFORMATION COLLECTED
At this website, we may collect both personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information from you.
1. Personally Identifiable Information.
a. You don’t have to provide us with your personally identifiable information (such as your name, address, telephone number, email address, etc.) in order to read most of what’s posted on this Site. We may, however, collect personally identifiable information about you when you submit it to us – such as when you open an account with us, register to use certain features of the Site, submit comments in response to one of our stories, sign up to receive information from us, enter a contest, respond to a survey, make a forum submission, post or submit an advertisement, email us, purchase something through the Site, or at times when we alert you that you must submit personally identifiable information.
b. The types of personally identifiable information we collect about you will depend on what you submit to us. For example, if you register to use certain features of the Site, such as the ability to submit comments or videos, you will be required to fill out a form that includes some of your personally identifiable information – such as your email address, age, gender, zip code, proposed password and User ID. We may also ask for your name, address, phone number, income, or other personal information. Similarly, if you sign up for a sweepstakes or contest on the Site, you may have to submit your name, address, email address, age, gender and other personal information. If you seek to purchase something through the Site, or if you register for a feature of the Site that is not free, then you will also have to provide your credit card number and perhaps a shipping address or other information related to the transaction.
c. If you email us, then we will collect your email address and any other personally identifiable information that you put in the email. If you respond to a survey or questionnaire, then we may collect any personal information in your response. If you post personally identifiable information on the Site, such as in comments to a story, in a forum on the Site, in a blog or in an advertisement, then we may collect that information as well.
d. If you sign up for an email newsletter, email notices, text alerts, or other electronic correspondence from us or through us, then we will collect your email address and/or mobile phone number or pager number and perhaps some other personally identifiable information about you such as your name, address, age, gender, income and any other information requested in the registration form. We may also collect a password and User ID.
e. Please note that advertisers and other third parties accessible on or through this Site may also collect personally identifiable information from you in order to use their services or buy their products. Please check their privacy policies for information about their privacy practices. In some cases these third parties may provide your personally identifiable information to Cordillera Communications.
2. Non-Personally Identifiable Information.
a. Non-personally identifiable information, such as which pages on the Site are accessed by the visitor, what information is downloaded, what type of browser and operating system are being used, which Internet service provider is being used, the Internet Protocol address (“IP address”) associated with the visitor’s computer, and other information of this general type may be collected about visitors to the Site. This information does not independently allow us to personally identify the Site visitor. By collecting this information we learn how best to develop our website and marketing efforts to meet the needs and desires of our visitors.
b. Advertisers may also collect non-personally identifiable information about Site visitors, and may provide such information to us.
B. METHODS OF INFORMATION COLLECTION
1. Personally identifiable information is collected when submitted by you – such as when you apply to open an account with us; register to use certain features of the Site; submit comments in response to one of our stories; sign up to receive emails, text messages or other information or correspondence from us; enter a sweepstakes or contest on or through the Site; respond to a survey or questionnaire; make a forum submission; post or submit an advertisement; email us; register to purchase something through the Site; or at times when we alert you that you must submit personally identifiable information.
2. Your personally identifiable information may also be collected by advertisers or other third parties and then provided to Cordillera Communications by the third party.
3. Non-personally identifiable information may be collected when submitted by you. It may also be collected via “cookies” (small text files placed on your computer’s hard drive), “web beacons” or other technology. Your computer may allow you to block cookies from us, but please understand that if you block our cookies or other technology, you may not be able to use all of the features or benefits of the Site.

Our service providers are not permitted to use your credit card number for purposes other than in association with your transaction.

Please note that we cannot guarantee the security of our databases or Site, nor can we guarantee that information will not be intercepted while being transmitted over the Internet. In order to use some of the features of this Site, you may be required to create an account with us. For your protection, this account will only be accessible by means of a password or similar security measure. If you believe that your password or other account information has been compromised, you should change your account with us immediately. If you forget your password, follow the instructions here.
E. CHILDREN
Cordillera Communications does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 through this Site unless such collection is done in accordance with the law. If you are a child under the age of 13 that intends to submit information to Cordillera Communications through this Site, you must obtain your parent’s consent prior to making such a submission. In the event that Cordillera Communications obtains actual knowledge that you are a child under the age of 13, Cordillera Communications may require that you (and/or your parent) prove to us your prior parental consent. Even if you are 13 or over, we recommend that all children under the age of 18 obtain parental consent prior to registration, submission or purchase of anything through this Site. To review and print our parental privacy consent form, please click here.
F. ACCESS TO YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION AND “OPT OUT” PROCEDURES
You may change your online account information with Cordillera Communications and may change your preferences or “opt out” of certain options by accessing your account through the Site here (if you forgot your password, follow the instructions here). For additional privacy concerns, please contact our Privacy Administrator at the address set forth in the “Contact Us” section of this Privacy Statement, below. Please keep in mind that to protect your privacy and security, we may take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you access to any personally identifiable information or “opt out” capabilities. To change the information that you provided to third party service providers, such as in conjunction with advertisements or other links from this Site, please contact the service provider. Their policies will dictate the extent to which you can access or change the information that they have collected about you.
G. PARENTAL OPTIONS AND REVIEW
Parents of children under the age of 13 have the option to agree to the collection and use of their child’s personal information without consenting to the disclosure of the information to third parties (subject to Cordillera Communications’s protection of itself and others, disclosures for legal reasons, and Cordillera Communications’s current technological capabilities). In addition, parents can review the personal information provided by their child under the age of 13, ask to have it deleted and refuse to allow any further collection or use of the child’s information (subject to the same limitations as above). In order to make these requests, parents should follow the procedures set forth in the “Access to Your Personal Information and ‘Opt Out’ Procedures” section of this Privacy Statement and/or contact our Privacy Administrator listed in the “Contact Us” section of this Privacy Statement. Please note that, while this Site will not require more information from children under 13 than is reasonably necessary to participate in any activity or event, deletion of required information (such as information that would permit Cordillera Communications to contact the winner of a contest) may result in termination of the child’s participation in an event or activity. Parents should also note that the official rules for contests and promotions on this website may contain additional information related to their children’s privacy and the parent’s rights and responsibilities.
