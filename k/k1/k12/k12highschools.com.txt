Non-Personal and Aggregated Information Collected Automatically
Each time you visit our website, we log non-personal information. Such information includes your IP address, domain name, the name of the Web page from which you entered our website, which pages you visit on our website, and how much time you spend on each page. We use this information to monitor and improve our website and for internal analysis. In particular, we use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the website, and gather information for aggregate use. However, IP addresses are not linked to personal information.
Use of Cookies
Our website uses "cookies" to help personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you. We use cookies to keep track of how you are using the Sites to tailor Web content to your interests. If you have registered your children for a K¹² virtual program, cookies will ease your access to the K¹² Online School ("OLS"), as defined below, and navigation around the OLS. K¹² cookies do not contain personal information about the parent(s) or children enrolled in K¹² virtual programs.
We will not share or sell non-aggregated information contained within cookies to any third party.
You also have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If, however, you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of our Sites or have some of our services on the Sites function properly.
Personal Information You Provide
You can use portions of our Sites without divulging any personal information, including your e-mail address. Our Sites do not collect personal information about individuals except when such individuals specifically provide such information on a voluntary basis (for example, registering for a K¹² virtual program, requesting a catalog; requesting additional information by contacting us; signing up for K¹² in-person orientation; posting a message to a message board; requesting help; or accessing, adding to, or changing the information on your account information page on the OLS). When you register your children for a K¹² virtual program or participate in a K¹² virtual program through an affiliate or local school, we may collect information regarding you and your children. This personal information may be collected on our Sites, or via telephone or conventional mail. The types of information that you may be asked to provide, depending on what services you would like to receive, include: first and last name; billing address; the names and ages of your children; the services you request; registration and enrollment information about your children; and an e-mail address where we can contact you.
K¹² calls customers to provide information they have requested and to answer questions. Because we only call customers at the telephone numbers they leave for us, K¹² does not call people by generating random or sequential telephone numbers. K¹² may use pre-recorded messages in order to ensure that customers receive the information they requested. Customers do not have to consent to receive calls in order to receive K¹²’s services.
Once you have registered your children for a K¹² virtual program (whether you registered on our Sites, or through offline communications), there is an online service for all such programs (collectively, the "OLS"). There will be a personal information page on the OLS that contains some or all of your personal information. You may also be assigned a Member ID and password and may create, at your discretion, a Member ID for your children any time you are logged on to the OLS. The Member ID will be used to recognize you and your children on the OLS portion of the K¹² Site. The Member ID will allow K¹² to recognize: your first and last name; registration ID; type of account, such as teacher, administrator, parent or student (if you created a separate Member ID and password for your children); school affiliation or the K¹² virtual program in which your children are enrolled; integration number; and the e-mail address you provided. The Member ID and the OLS will also allow you to track your children's attendance, school work, and testing, and to submit relevant portions of same to K¹², its affiliates, and/or your local school to track your children's progress and abide by State and/or Federal standards and regulations.
K¹², its affiliates, and/or your local school may use personal information provided by you on your account information page on OLS to contact you about your children's progress, testing, attendance, customer service, and quality control procedures. To the extent that third party vendors assist K¹² and/or its affiliates in the provision of online products or services, those vendors are provided the minimum amount of data required to perform the tasks for which they have been engaged. They have no independent rights to such data and have agreed to adhere to the K¹² Privacy Policy.
K¹² may use the personal information on your account information page on OLS to provide you with information about new products and services available through K¹². You can request to opt out of receiving such information by making a request in writing to privacy@K12.com
K¹² may share your information with companies that are not affiliated with K¹² but who are interested in sending you information about their products and services. You can request that your personal information not be shared with independent third parties by making a request in writing to privacy@K12.com
You can review and edit the personal information that you have provided to K¹² by making a request in writing to privacy@K12.com
