Kyäni Privacy Shield Notice
Last Updated: May 11, 2018
Kyäni’s Privacy Shield Privacy Notice
Privacy Shield certification requires Kyäni, Inc. and its Affiliates1 (“Kyäni,” “we,” or “us”) to collect, use,
transfer, retain and otherwise process the Personal Data2 of EEA and Swiss individuals (“Covered
Persons”—and if you are a Covered Person, “you”) in compliance with the principles of the Privacy Shield
Frameworks.
Kyäni complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework
as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal
information from European Union member countries and Switzerland transferred to the United States
pursuant to Privacy Shield. Kyäni has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles with respect
to such data. If there is any conflict between the policies in this privacy policy and data subject rights under
the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy
Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/
Privacy Shield Privacy Principles
Notice
When we directly collect any Personal Data from Covered Persons, we notify them about the purposes for
which we collect and use Personal Data, the types of third parties to which we disclose the information, the
choices they have for limiting the use and disclosure of their information, and how to contact us about our
practices concerning Personal Data.
When we receive Personal Data from our Affiliates, service providers, or others in the EEA or Switzerland
rather than collecting it directly, we will use and disclose such information in accordance with the notices
provided by such entities and the choices made by the individuals to whom such Personal Data relates.
Purpose of Collection and Use of Personal Data
Kyäni collects, uses, transfers, retains and otherwise processes Personal Data for the purposes of providing
products and services to Covered Persons and/or to our Business Partners, to comply with our legal and
other record-keeping obligations, for digital marketing, and for other purposes permitted by law.
We generally do not collect sensitive Personal Data of vendors, service providers, customers, or
Business Partners, such as information about medical or health conditions, racial or ethnic origin,

Kyäni’s U.S.-based Affiliates include Kyani Caring Hands, Inc.; Kyani Caring Hands Trust; Kyani
Global LLC; Ky-Sun, Inc.; Kyani Canada Holdings, Inc
2
“Personal Data” has the meaning set forth in the Privacy Shield.
Kyäni Internet Privacy Policy
political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership or other sensitive
information as defined by the Privacy Shield Frameworks.
The only exception is that we at times may obtain access to sensitive Personal Data related to
employees of one or more EU affiliates who are located in the EU. We do not solicit or actively
collect the information and always obtain it due to the voluntary act of the EU employee. When we
obtain such information, we use it and maintain it only as necessary to fulfill our obligations as
employer and in accordance with the standards and requirements of the Privacy Shield
Frameworks.
We receive and store any information entered on our web site or given to us in any other way. Most
commonly, the information we receive and store is not optional because it is required in order to
effectively and/or legally provide Covered Persons or their affiliates or associates with access to our
products, services and business opportunity. In some cases Covered Persons can choose not to provide
certain information, in which case the information is noted as optional, but doing so may reduce the
number or the quality of the products and/or services we are able to provide. We use the information that
we receive to respond to requests, help Business Partners (as defined in the Kyäni Global Compensation
Plan) run their Kyäni businesses, customize future shopping, improve our website or operations,
communicate with customers or Business Partners, and track results for ourselves and our Business
Partners.
The specific types of information that we collect about Covered Persons are:
•    Information given to us by the person to whom it relates. We obtain most of the
information we process or collect directly from the person to whom the information
relates. This information varies widely but can include names, email, phone numbers,
social media accounts and similar information, social insurance numbers and other
identification information, tax information, travel information (passports for company-
sponsored trips, for example), financial information such as methods of payment or bank
accounts, transportation information, and relationship information (regarding, for example,
spouses or children). In many cases it also includes regulatory or legal information. It
also includes the content of any reviews, emails, or other communications made to us or
about us by a Covered Person.
•    Information generated by our systems. Our systems calculate, generate, or store certain
Personal Data based on the sales activities, marketing activities, purchasing activities, or
financial activities of Covered Persons or other individuals whose activities our systems
track and use to generate Personal Data that applies to one or more Covered Persons. For
example, we regularly collect sales data from our customers or Business Partners, which
generates commission payments to a Covered Person that are Personal Data. As another
example, we also generate information about the performance of groups of our Business
Partners, which may become Personal Data as to one or more Covered Persons.
•    Information provided to us by others. At times other people may provide to us
information about a Covered Person. For example, we provide prospecting tools that
Business Partners can use to manage their contact lists and make contact with prospects.
Kyäni Internet Privacy Policy
The information we receive about Covered Persons from other people varies widely but
typically involves contact information and possibly information about these individuals’
activities.
•    Automatic information. In addition, we collect and analyze a lot of technical data that is
provided to us automatically when Covered Persons use one of our sites or web
applications. Examples might include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, computer and
connection information, purchase history, and the phone number used to call us. We may
also use browser data such as cookies, Flash cookies (also known as Flash Local Shared
Objects), or similar data. During some visits we may use software tools such as JavaScript
to measure and collect session information. We may also collect technical information to
help us identify devices for fraud prevention and diagnostic purposes.
•    Mobile. We collect data from mobile phones, including without limitation, as applicable,
the data set forth in “Automatic Information” above, as well as location data and other
mobile specific data including limitation carriers, application data, and other data. Most
mobile devices provide users with the ability to disable location services. If you have
questions about how to disable your device's location services, we recommend you contact
your mobile service carrier or your device manufacturer.
•    Information from Other Sources. Examples of information we receive from other sources
include updated delivery and address information from our carriers or other third parties,
which we use to correct our records and deliver new purchases or communication more
easily; site analytics information generated by third party site analysis tools, and customer
email delivery information coming from our attempts to communicate with Covered
Persons.
•    Human Resources Data. Kyäni has EU affiliates with employees who are Covered
Persons. These human resource data related to these Covered Persons may at times be
transferred to Kyäni.
Choice
Covered Persons may choose to change their Personal Data or cancel an account by using Kyäni’s web
portal, via phone to our customer service line, or through other appropriate means of communication,
including using the contact information below. They can also unsubscribe from our marketing
communications by following the instructions or unsubscribe mechanism in the relevant message. While
Kyäni (including its affiliates) has no intention of ever using or disclosing the Personal Data of a Covered
Person for a purpose materially different from the purposes listed in this policy, if we ever do so, we will
first offer Covered Persons the opportunity to opt-out of such uses and/or disclosures where they involve
non-sensitive information or to opt-in where sensitive information is involved. Should a Covered Person
opt-out as described above, Kyäni may not be able to provide them with the products or services they have
requested or to permit them to continue as a Business Partner or employee, depending on the nature
Kyäni’s need and/or legal obligation to maintain and use such Personal Data.
Kyäni Internet Privacy Policy
In addition, we may use or disclose Personal Data without offering individuals an opportunity to opt-out (i)
if we are required to do so by law or legal process, (ii) to law enforcement authorities or other government
officials based on an enforceable government request or as may be required under applicable law, or (iii)
when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in
connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.
In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public
authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
Accountability for Onward Transfer of Personal Data
Kyäni may share Personal Data with its service providers, Business Partners, and among its subsidiaries
and affiliates. Specifically and without limitation, Kyäni will share certain aspects of Covered Persons’
Personal Data with upline and/or downline Business Partners.
Kyäni operates in many countries across the world. To enable Kyäni to offer consistent service to Covered
Persons, wherever they may be, we manage certain website functions from one central location. This is
currently in the United States. In addition, Business Partners in the upline or downline of a Covered Person
may be established in countries other than EEA countries, Switzerland, or the United States. There is not
one set of data protection laws that covers Europe, the U.S. and other parts of the world, and the European
laws require that Kyäni take steps to protect Covered Persons’ information when it is transferred to regions
outside of Europe. Those steps include:
•   for international transfers to other Kyäni entities around the world, Kyäni relies on
intercompany agreements and Kyäni’s worldwide compliance protocol;
•   for international transfers to service providers, the protections depend on the
service provider concerned and its location, and include agreements containing
data protection clauses as required by law;
•   for international transfer, if any, to members in the upline and/or downline, of a
Covered Person, Kyäni relies on the execution of the Kyäni Independent Business
Partner Agreement and the relevant provisions of the Policies and Procedures.
If a third party does not comply with its privacy obligations, Kyäni will take commercially reasonable steps
to prevent or stop the use or disclosure of Personal Data. If a third party service provider providing services
on Kyäni’s behalf processes Personal Data from the EEA or Switzerland in a manner inconsistent with the
Privacy Shield Principles, Kyäni will be liable unless we can prove that we are not responsible for the
event giving rise to the damages.
Security
Kyäni maintains reasonable and appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect
Personal Data from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.
Access to Information
Kyäni provides employees, consumers, customers, Business Partners, suppliers and others with
confirmation of whether or not Kyäni is processing Personal Data relating to them and reasonable access to
Personal Data maintained about them. We also provide a reasonable opportunity to correct, amend or
Kyäni Internet Privacy Policy
delete that information where it is inaccurate. We may limit or deny access to Personal Data where
providing such access is unreasonably burdensome or expensive under the circumstances, or as otherwise
permitted by the relevant legal principles. To obtain access to Personal Data, consumers, customers,
suppliers and others may contact Kyäni as specified in the “How to Contact Us” section of this Policy.
Examples of information easily available in the Kyäni.com back office or in our shopping cart system
include up-to-date information regarding recent orders; personally identifiable information (including all or
some of the following-- name, e-mail, website address, paid-as rank and lifetime rank, password,
communications, notes from phone calls, downline and upline information, portions of payment
information, shipping information, and other business related information); payment settings (including
credit card information and promotional certificate and gift card balances, if any); e-mail notification
settings (including newsletters, ordering alerts, and similar information); shopping history; and Business
Partner account information.
Covered Persons have a right to access their own Personal Data, including sensitive Personal Data, for any
lawful purpose, except where providing such access is unreasonably burdensome or expensive under the
circumstances, or as Kyäni is otherwise permitted by the relevant legal principles to limit or deny such
access. Once the purpose for which the data was collected and/or processed has passed, and no legal
obligation requires it to be kept, Covered Persons have the right to have such data erased or forgotten.
Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation
Kyäni takes reasonable steps to ensure that Personal Data collected by Kyäni is relevant for the purposes
for which it is to be used and that the information is reliable for its intended use and is accurate, complete
and current. We depend on our employees, Business Partners, consumers, customers, suppliers and others
to update or correct their Personal Data whenever necessary.
Recourse, Enforcement and Liability
Kyäni has established procedures for periodically verifying implementation of and compliance with the
Privacy Shield principles. We conduct an annual self-assessment of our practices with respect to Personal
Data to verify that representations we make about our Personal Data privacy practices are true and that
related privacy policies have been implemented as represented.
With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks, Kyäni is
subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.
Dispute Resolution
In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Kyäni commits to resolve complaints about your privacy
and our collection or use of your personal information transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy
Shield. EEA and Swiss individuals with Privacy Shield inquiries or complaints should first contact us
using the information provided in the below “How to Contact Us” section.
Kyäni has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the Privacy Shield Principles to

of Better Business Bureaus. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your
Kyäni Internet Privacy Policy
complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers

resources data transferred to the United States from the EU and/or Switzerland in the context of the
employment relationship, Kyäni commits to cooperate with the panel established by the EU data protection
authorities (DPA Panel) and/or the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner, as
applicable and to comply with the advice given by the DPA panel and/or Commissioner, as applicable with
regard to such human resources data. To pursue an unresolved human resources complaint, you should
contact the state or national data protection or labor authority in the appropriate jurisdiction.
