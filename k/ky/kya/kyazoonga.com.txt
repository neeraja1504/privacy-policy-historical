This privacy policy ("Policy") only applies to transactions made, and data gathered, on the KyaZoonga.com or mobile phone applications (SMS and GPRS) (collectively, the "Site"). Please review this Policy periodically as we may update it from time to time. This Policy was last revised on March 25, 2007. If there are significant changes to the Site's information practices, you will be provided with appropriate online notice. You may be provided other privacy-related information in connection with your use of offerings from the Site as well as for special features and services not described in this Policy that may be introduced in the future. Each time you visit the Site or provide us with information, by doing so you are accepting the practices described in this Policy at that time. You agree that by using the Site you are expressly and affirmatively consenting to our use and disclosure of the information that you provide, and consenting to receive emails, as described below in this Policy.
Information We Collect From You
In order to operate the Site and provide you with information on products and services that may be of interest to you, we may collect "contact information" (i.e., information that could be used to contact you such as full name, postal address, phone number and email address as well as your computer's unique IP address (if any)), "financial information" (i.e., passwords, credit and debit card numbers and bank and other financial institution account numbers) and "demographic information" (e.g., PIN code, hometown, gender, purchase history information, posting and sales information and age as well as IP addresses that are not unique to your computer) from you. Please note that nowhere on the Site do we knowingly collect contact information or financial information from children under the age of 13.
How We Use Contact Information; Responsibility
Order and Payment Processing, Customer Service, Credit Card Issuers and Quality Assurance
We use contact information to help us efficiently perform transactions, to deliver the services you have requested and to fulfill your requests for products, programs, and services, to perform quality assurance, sales analyses and other business analyses, to operate and improve the services and offerings available through the Site, to personalize the content and advertisements provided to you, to contact you in connection with events for which you order, post or sell tickets (including ticket confirmations, changes and cancellations) and respond to your inquiries, to conduct research about your use of the Site, to help offer you other products, programs, or services that may be of interest. In some cases we may use service providers to help us perform some of these tasks, including, but not limited to, processing or fulfilling your orders, or performing customer service, business analyses or quality control, and consequently we may share your contact information with these service providers. In such cases, we often require these service providers to enter into agreements with us regarding the confidential handling of your information. We may also provide your contact information to your credit card issuer or to credit card processors for their purposes. When you make a purchase through the Site, or register with the Site, you will provide us with an email address where we, or these service providers, may contact you for the purposes described in this paragraph.
Contacting you for Offers and Promotions
After you provide us with an email address in connection with ordering or trying to sell tickets through the Site or registering with the Site, or in connection with any Special Offers as described below, you may visit the "My Account" section of the Site, where you will be given the opportunity to tell us not to use that email address to send you promotional emails. "Promotional emails" are emails that are sent solely for promotional purposes. By submitting an email address to us, you agree that KyaZoonga (on behalf of itself or on behalf of others) may send promotional emails to that email address until such time that you so indicate your preference not to receive them. Because many consumers like to receive some, but not all, types of promotional emails, "My Account" provides you with the opportunity to choose which types of promotional emails you do not want to receive. Please note that if you ask not to receive promotional emails from KyaZoonga, you may still receive promotional emails during the next 72 hour period (as it may take some time for your preferences to be updated throughout our computer systems), you may still receive non-promotional emails from KyaZoonga, and you may still receive emails from certain others (including, but not limited to, Event Providers (defined below)); please read the rest of this Policy to learn how others may contact you.
Providing Merchants with Contact Information
In addition to selling movie tickets on the Site, KyaZoonga may sell other goods or services, allow you to make reservations, or allow you to participate in (or register for) contests, sweepstakes or other offers or programs (such as discount or rewards programs, magazine subscriptions, hotel bookings or cruises) on the Site. Typically, these goods, services, contests, sweepstakes or other offers or programs ("Special Offers") for which you make purchases, orders or reservations, or for which you participate in or register, are provided by third parties ("Merchants"). Consequently, if you elect to engage in a Merchant's Special Offer, KyaZoonga may provide that Merchant with your contact information - in fact, when you elect to engage in a Merchant's Special Offer you consent for us to provide your email address and other information to that Merchant. Because Merchants are not part of KyaZoonga, Merchants are not subject to this Policy and may use your contact information to communicate with you by sending emails or through other means, and may share your contact information with others. If you want to learn about a particular Merchant's privacy policies, or you do not want to receive communications from a particular Merchant, or you have other questions, instructions or concerns to which you would like a Merchant to respond, then you must contact that Merchant directly.
Divulging Your Contact Information for Legal and Administrative Reasons
We may disclose specific contact information when we determine that such disclosure will be helpful to comply with law, to cooperate with or seek assistance from law enforcement or to protect the interests or safety of KyaZoonga or other visitors to the Site or users of services or products provided by KyaZoonga or to take part with others in joint anti-fraud activities. Also, your contact information may be passed on to a third party in the event of a transfer of ownership or assets, or a bankruptcy, of KyaZoonga.
Providing Non-KyaZoonga Affiliates with Contact Information
We may also share your contact information with our Non-KyaZoonga Affiliates (defined below), but each Non-KyaZoonga Affiliate who receives your contact information will comply with the terms of this Policy with respect to its use and disclosure of the contact information we share with it, unless the Non-KyaZoonga Affiliate is also receiving it because it is Multiplex or Merchant as described above (in which case it will not be required to comply with this Policy with respect to its use or disclosure of such information). When we say "Non-KyaZoonga Affiliates" we mean KyaZoonga' subsidiaries, parents and affiliates (and businesses owned by KyaZoonga and such companies) that are not part of KyaZoonga
Other Instances where Contact Information may be Shared If you are opted out of receiving all promotional emails, then we will not share your contact information with unaffiliated third parties, unless we are otherwise permitted to under this Policy (for example, we will still be permitted to share your contact information with Multiplexes or Merchants but only to the extent permitted above). If you do not opt out of receiving all promotional emails, then we may share your contact information if we believe it makes business sense. These third parties may communicate directly with you about their products and services.
Responsibility
KyaZoonga will not be responsible or otherwise liable for any use or disclosure of your contact information by a third party to whom KyaZoonga is allowed to disclose your contact information under this Policy.

In such cases, we will require these service providers to enter into agreements with us regarding the confidential handling of your information. We may also provide your financial information to your credit card issuer, financial institutions or credit card processors to process transactions and for their other purposes. We may provide your financial information to Multiplexes, primarily for facilitating "will call" ticket pick up, dispute resolution and customer service at the venue on the date of the movie, and may provide your financial information to those Merchants who are providing you with the goods, services or reservations you purchase or order, or who are administering the offers or programs you enter through this Site (or you enter through another site after clicking on a link on this Site promoting such an offer or program).
