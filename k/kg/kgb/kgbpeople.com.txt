Privacy Policy - Conduit Global
Last Updated September 16, 2016
Our Commitment to Privacy ** **
Conduit Global, Inc. (“Conduit Global”) considers the responsible use of personal information to be a critical element in enabling the Internet to reach its potential as a tool for personal and professional activities.  Conduit Global intends to give you as much control as possible over your personal information and we are committed to protecting your personal privacy.  We provide this privacy policy (the “Policy”) to explain the type of information we collect on our website, www.conduitglobal.com (the “Website”).  This Policy also explains the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.
The Information We Collect
This Policy applies to all information submitted on the Website.  In general, you can visit www.conduitglobal.com without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself.  There are times, however, when we may need information from you (such as your name and address, telephone number, and/or email address) to be able to provide you with the information, service or product you have requested.  Conduit Global will seek to notify you before we collect any personal information from you through this Website.  Some examples of when we may need information are requests by you for information from our Resource Library, which we may deliver to you by email.  We do keep track of the domains from which people visit our site.  If you do not want us or our business partners or affiliates to contact you, you may choose to “opt-out”.  You may “opt-out” by emailing your request to info@conduitglobal.com, and we will take steps to remove your information from our records.
In general on the Website, IP addresses (the Internet address of a computer) are logged to track a user’s session while the user remains anonymous.  We analyze this data for certain trends and statistics, such as which parts of our Website users are visiting and how long they spend there. Additionally, we may collect computer and connection information such as browser type, version, and time zone setting, browser plug-in type and versions, and operating system for similar purposes.
The Way We Use Information
We use the information that you provide us to better design our Website and to enhance our marketing strategy and our products.  To the extent such information is shared with third parties, please see the “Onward Transfer” section, below.
Use of Cookies
Conduit Global web pages use “cookies”, which are small files stored on your computer that help websites remember who you are and information about your visit.  We use cookies to better tailor the Website and our products/services to your interests and needs.  Cookies may also be used to help improve your user experience by remembering the information that you have already provided to Conduit Global.  We do not use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not voluntarily provided by you.  You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept the cookie.  However, by not accepting cookies, some web pages may not display properly or you may not be permitted to access certain information.  If you want to know more about how cookies work and how to manage or delete them, visit the All About Cookies website (http:wwwallaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/) or the Interactive Advertising Bureau’s website (http://www.youronlinechoices.com).

Onward Transfer
Occasionally, we may share aggregate, non-personally identifiable information about our users with our business partners and affiliates.  Other than our business partners and affiliates, we do not provide personally identifiable information to any third party for any purpose whatsoever.  One of our business partners or affiliates may from time to time also ask for other personal information via the Internet.  They may use this information to correspond with you or for other purposes to support your request or their own business interests.  If you wish to opt-out of receiving future email or mailings from third party vendors, please contact them directly.
Links to other Sites
Users should be aware that when you are on this Website you could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control.  There may be links to other sites that take you outside our service, for example, links to business partners and affiliates.  These other sites may send their own cookies to users, or otherwise collect data or solicit personal information.  If the Conduit Global Website links you to any third party web page, we make no representation or warranty as to the existence, sufficiency, accuracy or completeness of their privacy policy.
Our Commitment to Data Security
We take the security of your personal information very seriously.  We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic and managerial policies/procedures designed to safeguard the information we collect and which cover storing, using and releasing personal data that you have provided and preventing unauthorized access or use.  We have put into place technical and organizational measures designed to prevent unauthorized or unlawful processing of personal information and designed to prevent accidental access, disclosure, alteration, loss or destruction of, or damage to, personal information.  We use an internal self-assessment program to verify that this Policy is accurate, comprehensive, prominently displayed, implemented and accessible.  The self-assessment program is also used to indicate whether or not this Policy adheres to the Safe Harbor principles, as applicable, and aims to ensure that we have in place procedures for training employees regarding implementation and discipline for failure to comply, as well as periodically conducting objective reviews of compliance with the same.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online and you do so at your own risk.
