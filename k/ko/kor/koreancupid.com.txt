If You wish to have Your Personal Data erased, please communicate Your request to us using the contact information provided in clause 1.2. The only circumstances in which we will not take reasonable steps to erase Your Personal Data are where we need to keep it in accordance with another provision of this Privacy Policy, the GDPR, or for any other legal reason. However, our deleting of Your Personal Data will also result in the deletion of Your Cupid Media account and will mean You are unable to access our services.
5.7 Refusal to correct or erase
If at any time we refuse or deny You access to Your Personal Data, or refuse to correct or erase Your Personal Data, we will provide You with reasons for such denial or refusal.
5.8 Restriction of processing

Where Your requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive in nature (particularly due to repetitiveness) we may elect to charge You a reasonable fee taking into account the administrative costs of providing the information or communication, or taking the action requested. Where Your requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive in nature we may also refuse Your request.
5.10 Specific objection rights
If it becomes necessary for us to process Your Personal Data without Your consent for reasons of:
(a) performing a task in the public interest;
