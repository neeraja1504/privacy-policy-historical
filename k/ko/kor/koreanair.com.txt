Welcome to Korean Air
Safe Ticket Purchasing Guaranteed
Why is KoreanAir.com so safe?
Airtight information security technology! KoreanAir.com is safe, because our secure server provides 128-bit decryption/encryption for all your data. When you first log onto your personalized page, Korean Air's secure server receives your encrypted (encoded) information. (Your browser automatically encrypts information you submit over the Internet to ensure that no one can read it during transmission.) The power of Korean Air's secure server is twofold: 1) it can decrypt (decode) information transmitted from your browser and 2) re-encrypt information that it sends back to you. Essentially, this decryption/encryption process cloaks your data by translating it into a secret code which only Korean Air can read, keeping your credit card and other personal information airtight while it travels over the Internet. Purchasing tickets online at KoreanAir.com is even safer than using your credit card at a travel agency or department store!
Will Korean Air release my personal information to others?
No way! The information you submit is just between us! Once we receive your data, it is automatically protected against unauthorized access, and Korean Air commits to you that we will never release any of your information to an outside company or entity.
How can I tell if a KoreanAir.com web page is secure?
See the secure-lock image! You can tell which Web pages are secure, because each secure page shows a picture of a secure lock. In addition, your browser itself identifies secure pages. On the toolbar in Netscape, there is a secure-lock icon that becomes highlighted when a secure page is open. Similarly, in Internet Explorer you should see a lock icon in the lower right corner showing that a page is secure. (Of course, you will not see this icon on non-secure pages.)
