EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Frameworks
Kount complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States, respectively. Kount has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/.
Kount is a "processor" of personal data as defined in Article 2(e) of the Directive. Kount provides processing services in the US for its European Union and Swiss business partners (“EU and Swiss Business Partners”) which include merchants and financial institutions and other applicable businesses. Kount also provides processing for US based business partners. We act as a data processor and data importer on behalf of our EU and Swiss Business Partners, and accordingly we follow the instructions provided by each Business Partner with regard to the collection, processing and protection of personal data provided to us by each such Business Partner. Each Business Partner acts as the data controller and data exporter for any personal data within its control. EU and Swiss individuals should contact the applicable Business Partner with questions regarding the collection of their personal data.
In compliance with the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles (“the Principles”), Kount commits to resolve questions and complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information. EU and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding this privacy policy and/or the types of data Kount collects, should contact Kount at privacy@kount.com. Please note that Kount acts as a data processor and the majority of the data Kount processes is anonymous. In instances of onward transfers, Kount has the responsibility for processing personal information that is not anonymized in accordance with the Principles and subsequent transfers to third parties that may act on Kount’s behalf. Kount will remain liable under the Principles if its third-party agents process such non-anonymized personal information in a manner inconsistent with the Principles unless we can prove we were not a party to the events giving rise to the damages. Kount acknowledges the right of EU and Swiss individuals to access their personal data pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks. Any personal information that Kount collects that is not anonymous is available for European Union individuals to access upon request for correction or deletion.

As a last resort, and in limited situations, European Union and Swiss individuals may seek redress from the Privacy Shield Panel, a binding arbitration mechanism. Kount is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
