If necessary to perform a service you request from us, to execute an order you have placed or to follow-up on your enquiries, we will share your information with other Kofax entities or third party service providers, for example email and hosting providers, suppliers and delivery services.

Third party service providers will process your information on behalf of Kofax for the purposes above. When we share your data with these parties, we make sure that appropriate safeguards are taken to protect your information.
Where will we send your data?
We may transfer your personal data to our Kofax affiliates or third parties (e.g., service providers) overseas, which may involve the transfer of personal data to countries outside the European Economic Area which have different data protection standards to those which apply in the European Economic Area. For a list of the countries in which we operate, please see https://www.kofax.com/contact-us/offices.
The international footprint of Kofax involves a large number of transfers of personal information between different subsidiaries, as well as to third parties located in the countries where we do business. For example, Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS) involved in transfer of personal data. Some of these countries are subject to a European Commission adequacy decision. For other countries, we have put in place European Commission-approved standard contractual clauses within the Kofax group or with the relevant third party to protect this personal data. We also rely on other permitted data transfer mechanisms such as relying on the relevant third party’s Privacy Shield certification or third party corporate rules (approved by EU data protection authorities and put in place to protect your personal data). You have a right to ask us for a copy of the safeguard used (by contacting us as set out below).
Where information is transferred outside the EEA, and where this is to an Kofax affiliate or vendor in a country that is not subject to an adequacy decision by the EU Commission(read more here.), data is adequately protected by EU Commission approved standard contractual clauses (read more here), an appropriate Privacy Shield certification (read more here) or a vendor's Processor Binding Corporate Rules.
How long do we store your data?
We retain information about you only for as long as we need it for the purposes for which it was collected. After that time your personal data will be erased (unless we have the statutory right or obligation to further keep this data).
For example, if you are a customer of Kofax, we will keep your information for the duration of the contractual relationship you have with us, and, to the extent permitted, after the end of that relationship for as long as necessary to perform the purposes set out in this notice. The criteria to determine the storage period are statutory and contractual requirements, the nature of our relationship with you, the nature of the data concerned, technical necessities. Laws may require us to hold certain information for specific periods.
Where we process personal data for marketing purposes or with your consent, we process the data until you ask us to stop and for a short period after this (to allow us to implement your request). We also keep a record of the fact that you have asked us not to send you direct marketing or to process your data so that we can respect your request in future.
How do we protect your data?
We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. In order to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, we have put in place technical and organisational measures to safeguard and secure the information we process from you.
What are your rights?
You have the right to ask us:
for access to and a copy of your personal data that we hold on you (Art. 15 GDPR)
for a copy of the personal information you provided to us and to provide it to you or send to a third party in a commonly used, machine readable format (Art. 20 GDPR)
to update or correct your personal data in order to make it accurate (Art. 16 GDPR)
to delete your personal data from our records in certain circumstances Art. 17 GDPR)
to restrict the processing of your personal data in certain circumstances (Art. 18 GDPR).
and you may also:
object to us processing your personal data in certain circumstances (in particular, where we don’t have to process the data to meet a contractual or other legal requirement, or where we are using the data for direct marketing - Art. 21 GDPR)
withdraw your consent at any time, where we are using your personal data with your consent. This will not affect our use of your personal data prior to the withdrawal of your consent. If you want, you can opt out your consent anytime by updating your consent at DSAR Center
These rights may be limited in some situations – for example, where we can demonstrate that we have a legal requirement to process your data. In some instances, this may mean that we are able to retain data even if you withdraw your consent.
Where we require personal data to comply with legal or contractual obligations, then provision of such data is mandatory: if such data is not provided, then we will not be able to manage our contractual relationship, or to meet obligations placed on us. In all other cases, provision of requested personal data is optional.
We hope that we can satisfy queries you may have about the way we process your data. If you have any concerns about how we process your data, you can use the data subject rights request form at DSAR Center, or contact our Data Protection Officer at gdpr.privacy@kofax.com.
