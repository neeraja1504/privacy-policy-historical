If next business day delivery is unavailable, please select express delivery at checkout to receive your order within 3-4 business days.
Signing For your Purchase
US
We offer two methods of shipment for orders dispatched via UPS.
You can choose to sign for your order upon arrival. This ensures your purchases are safely delivered to you. This option is best for customers who prefer the security of a signed delivery. If you are unavailable when your package arrives, UPS will leave a re-delivery slip.
Alternatively, you may prefer to waive the signature requirement and UPS will leave your shipment outside of the premises for your convenience. Please note, orders containing items of high value may still require a signature, even if you did not select to sign for your order on arrival. We realize this may be inconvenient but we would like to ensure that your purchases arrive securely.
When placing an order, the signature requirement is set by default; however, you can update your preference on the shipping page before proceeding to purchase. Please note, that if no signature is collected, you agree to our terms and conditions and take full responsibility for any loss or damage that may occur.
International Orders
A signature is required for all international packages delivered by DHL.
Taxes & Duties
Taxes and duties are calculated according to your shipping destination and will be itemized at the bottom of the Order Summary page.
Canada
If you have purchased an item labelled "Made in the USA" and your chosen shipping destination is Canada, we will refund the duties for this piece. Simply contact Customer Care with your order number to arrange this for you once your delivery has arrived.
USA
Prices shown on the Site are in US Dollars and are exclusive of taxes. If you are shipping within the USA, local sales tax will be charged on all orders (where applicable). It is your responsibility as the customer to report any purchases of tangible personal property that have not been taxed by THE OUTNET and pay use tax on those purchases unless exempt under local State law.
We ship to most countries on a DDP (Delivery Duty Paid) basis, which means that all relevant import taxes and duties will be included in the final purchase price..

Delivery Processing Time
Before we can send your order, we may need to confirm your details with your card issuer. We will do our best to keep delays to a minimum.
Our delivery time starts from the moment an order is accepted and includes a 48-hour period where your items will be processed and dispatched.
While we aim to ensure that all orders are received when expected, delivery to a remote destination is not always guaranteed to arrive within the specified shipping timeframe.
We work closely with our shipping partner to minimize the potential impact of delays to our international customers. However, we are not responsible for any custom clearance delays.
Delivery Insurance
You can rest assured that we'll keep your purchases safe until they've reached you - promise! Your order is insured against theft and accidental damage during delivery. Once your purchases have been delivered to the specified address and signed for, they are no longer covered by insurance.
If you have specified a recipient that is not you for delivery purposes (for example, as a gift), you accept that a signature by that person (or someone at their delivery address) is evidence of delivery. This signature is also evidence of fulfillment of your order by THE OUTNET and transfers the responsibility of your purchased goods to you.
Product Restrictions
As THE OUTNET has to follow international trading agreements and regulations, we're unable to dispatch items made of exotic skins outside the US. Fine jewelry of certain compositions and products made in China are also not allowed to be shipped to some countries.
When a restricted item is added to your shopping bag, the site will automatically prompt you to remove it if we're unable to ship to the location you've selected. If you still wish to proceed with your order, you will need to have it delivered to a different destination address.
Russian Delivery Information
We are currently unable to dispatch orders containing jewelry to Russia. In order to receive your jewelry purchases, we suggest that you arrange for your shipment to be delivered to an alternative destination.

If we use the term "our Group", this means us and our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries (or any of them).

Third-party cookies
The cookies used on our online services
The cookies we and our business partners use on our online services can be grouped into the following categories:
Essential cookies : Some of the cookies on our online services are essential for us to be able to provide you with a service you have requested. An example of this would be a cookie that enables you to log into your account on the website, or one which allows communication between your browser and the website. Our cookie-preference cookie, described in the section 'How to reject or opt out of receiving cookies', is also an essential cookie. You may not be able to use our website without these cookies.
Website functionality cookies : These cookies enable you to browse our online services and use features such as shopping baskets and wish lists.
Website analytics cookies : We use these cookies to measure and analyse how our customers use our online services. An example is counting the number of different people visiting our website or using a particular feature, rather than the total number of times the site or feature is used. This allows us to continuously improve our online services and your shopping experience.
Customer preference cookies : When browsing or shopping online, our online services will remember preferences you make (for example your user name, language or location). This improves your experience and makes your browsing simpler, easier and more personal to you.
Social sharing cookies : We use cookies to allow you to share content directly on social networking/sharing sites like Instagram, Facebook and Twitter. Examples would be if you wanted to 'like' or 'tweet' about a product advertised on our online services.
Interest-based advertising cookies : You will have noticed, when visiting other websites, that you are shown adverts for products and services you may wish to buy. The money made by website owners for showing third-party adverts on their websites often pays for the cost of running the website, and therefore often allows you to use the website without having to pay a registration or usage fee. Like many businesses, we place adverts for our services on a range of our partners' websites. However, to try and ensure that the adverts you see are relevant to you, we use cookies to collect information about the types of things that interest you, for example websites you visit and your geographic location. Having these cookies does not increase the number of adverts you will be shown, but simply makes the adverts you see more relevant. In addition, they limit the number of times you see an advertisement, as well as helping us measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns.
Advertising cookies used on our business partners' websites : We place adverts on a number of third-party websites. We use cookies to control how often you are shown a particular advert on those websites, so you do not see the same advert too frequently. We do not collect any personal data within these cookies. To reject our use of these cookies, please refer to your browser settings as set out in the 'How to reject or opt out of receiving cookies' section below.
How to reject or opt out of receiving cookies : If you want to delete any cookies that are already on your computer, please refer to the help and support section on your internet browser for instructions on how to locate the file or directory that stores cookies. Please note that our online services cannot always control third-party cookies stored on your machine from our online services and that setting your cookie preferences with us will not stop those third-party cookies from being stored on your machine. Therefore you must manage these cookies directly with the relevant third party. Please see our 'Third party cookies' section below for more information. Information on deleting or controlling cookies is available at www.AboutCookies.org. Please note that by deleting our cookies or disabling future cookies you may not be able to access certain areas or features of our site.
Third-party cookies : Some of the cookies described above are stored on your machine by third parties when you use our online services. We have no control over these cookies or how the third parties use them. They are used to allow third parties to provide a service to us, for example analytics. For more information on these cookies and how to disable them, please see the individual third party's privacy policy listed below.

Orders
THE OUTNET offers products for sale that are in stock and available for dispatch from our distribution center. All orders are sold on a first come, first served basis and are subject to acceptance and availability. Furthermore, items in your shopping basket are not reserved and may be purchased by other customers.
When participating in Clearance sales customers must complete the check out procedure within the specified timeframes. Please see our Promotions for more information.
Pricing policy
If you are shipping within the USA, local sales tax will be charged on all orders (where applicable).
All prices and offers remain valid as advertised from time to time. The US Dollar price of a product displayed on the Site at the time the order is accepted will be honored, except in cases of patent error.
From time to time, prices are subject to change in response to currency exchange rate changes, markdowns and other commercial factors. The price applicable to your order will be the price current at the time your order is accepted.
If you are buying from outside the US, you will incur carriage costs and any duties levied by the jurisdiction to which you have specified delivery. If you are a customer whose credit/debit card is not denominated in US Dollars, the final price will be calculated in accordance with the applicable exchange rate on the day your credit/debit card company processes the transaction.
Promotions
Participation in Clearance sales and promotions is subject to the following terms and conditions:
CLEARANCE SALES
Clearance sales are open to all registered customers.
Customers must be registered with the US Site to participate in US Clearance sales.
All items are sold on a first come, first served basis and must be purchased before the timer expires.
All sales are final.
Promotion Codes
Promotion codes are non-transferable and there is no cash alternative. Furthermore, they cannot be used in conjunction with any other promotion code or offers, and must be redeemed by the date published, if provided.
Refer a friend
As of February 28, 2017, the Refer a Friend program is no longer available.
Any Store credit you have remaining from this program is valid for 12 months from the date of receipt and is only redeemable on THE OUTNET.
To stay up to date on the latest designer arrivals, promotions and more, make sure you’re registered for an account to receive our email updates.
Acceptance of your order
Once you have made your choice and your order has been placed, you will receive an email acknowledging the details of your order. This email is NOT an acceptance of your order.
Unless you cancel your order, acceptance of your order and completion of the contract between you and THE OUTNET will be perfected when we dispatch the goods to you at which time you will receive a second email containing your tracking number, and confirming that your order has been dispatched. The sale contract is therefore concluded in the State of New York, USA and the language of the contract is English. Neither our third party payment processor nor our nominated courier has the authority to accept an order on behalf of THE OUTNET.
We reserve the right not to accept your order in the event, for example, that we are unable to obtain authorization for payment, that shipping restrictions apply to a particular item, that the item ordered is out of stock or does not satisfy our quality control standards and is withdrawn, or that you do not meet the eligibility criteria set out within the TOS.
Furthermore, we may refuse to process a transaction for any reason or refuse service to anyone at any time at our sole discretion. We will not be liable to you or any third party by reason of our withdrawing any merchandise from the Site whether or not that merchandise has been sold, removing, screening or editing any materials or Content on the Site, refusing to process a transaction or unwinding or suspending any transaction after processing has begun.
Whilst every effort is made to make sure details on our website are accurate, we may from time to time discover an error in the pricing of products. If we discover an error in the pricing of a product in your order, we will let you know as soon as possible. We shall be under no obligation to accept or fulfil an order for a product that was advertised at an incorrect price and reserve the right to cancel such an order that has been accepted or is in transit. If you order a product that is priced incorrectly for any reason, we will email or telephone you to inform you that we have not accepted your order and/or that the relevant part of your order has been cancelled. If you have already paid for the goods, we shall refund the full amount as soon as we are able. In the event that products are recalled in transit, we will process your refund once the products have been returned to us.
Payment
Payment can be made by Visa, MasterCard, Discover, American Express, and any other methods which may be clearly advertised on the site from time to time. You can also choose to pay with PayPal. When selecting this option at checkout, you will be directed to the PayPal site to 'Log In' and review the amount shown before clicking 'Pay Now'. Once this transaction is complete, you will then return to THE OUTNET. Payment will be debited and cleared from your account upon completion of the packing of your order by THE OUTNET. You confirm that the credit/debit card that is being used is yours or that you have been specifically authorized by the owner of the credit/debit card to use it. All credit/debit card holders are subject to validation checks and authorization by the card issuer.
If the issuer of your credit/debit card refuses to authorize payment to THE OUTNET, we will not be liable for any delay or non-delivery. Occasionally, high demand causes us to run out of certain items. If we don't have an item that you have ordered in stock, we'll notify you by email immediately.
We take reasonable care to make our Site as secure as we can. All credit/debit card transactions on this site are processed using ChasePaymentech, a secure online payment gateway that encrypts your card details in a secure host environment. If you are a registered THE OUTNET user, we will securely store your credit/debit card details on our systems. These details will be fully encrypted and only used to process card transactions which you have initiated.
To help ensure that your shopping experience is safe, simple and secure THE OUTNET uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.
Furthermore, we take reasonable care, in so far as it is in our power to do so, to keep the details of your order and payment secure, but in the absence of negligence on our part we cannot be held liable for any loss you may suffer if a third party procures unauthorized access to any data you provide when accessing or ordering from the Site.
Gift Cards
Gift Cards are no longer available to purchase.
If you still have a Gift Card to redeem, enter your Gift Card code in the promotional box at checkout and the balance will be deducted from the final price.
For assistance redeeming your credit, please contact Customer Care.
Insurance and delivery
You will own the goods on and from the later of the point in time when: (a) we receive payment in full, or (b) we deliver the goods to you.
THE OUTNET insures each purchase during the time it is in transit until it is delivered to your specified delivery address. We require a signature for any goods delivered, at which point responsibility for your purchased goods passes to you. If you have specified a recipient who is not you for delivery purposes (for example as a gift) then you accept that evidence of a signature by them (or at that delivery address) is evidence of delivery and fulfilment by THE OUTNET and transfer of responsibility in the same way. The goods are your responsibility from the time we deliver them to the address you gave us.
The signature can be waived for domestic orders dispatched via UPS. When placing an order, the signature requirement is set by default; however, you can update your preference on the shipping page before proceeding to purchase. Please note, that if no signature is collected, you agree to our terms and conditions and, confirm that THE OUTNET can leave your package(s) outside the premises at the shipping address provided by you without obtaining a signature for proof of delivery. You authorise THE OUTNET to leave the package(s) at the shipping address without obtaining a signature and release and indemnify THE OUTNET from liability for any loss or damage that may result from leaving the package(s) at your shipping address without obtaining a signature.
Please note that we aim to dispatch all orders within 48 hours. Delivery times appearing on the Site are estimates and are to be used as a guide only and commence from the date of dispatch. In any event, we will deliver the goods to you within 30 days of the day on which we accept your order. THE OUTNET is not responsible for any delays caused by destination customs clearance processes.
If delivery is delayed by any event outside of our control, we will contact you as soon as possible to let you know and we will take steps to minimize the effect of the delay. Provided we do this, we will not be liable for delays caused by the event, but if there is a risk of substantial delay you may contact us to cancel your order and we will give you a refund for any goods you have paid for but not received.
Returns and exchanges
THE OUTNET will accept exchanges and returns in all categories with the exception of Clearance events. All Clearance items are Final Sale and cannot be returned or exchanged. We can only exchange for the same item in a different size based on stock availability. If you wish to exchange your item for an alternative product, we suggest that you return it for a store credit and purchase the new item separately. For details on how to return or exchange an item please refer to our Returns & Exchanges policy (hyperlink to help) for further information. Please note returns for exchanges are free of charge, but exchanges made to destinations outside of the U.S. will be processed for customs clearance and therefore any relevant import duty and tax charges will apply. If you selected PayPal when you placed your order, any applicable taxes and duties on your exchange should be paid with your debit or credit card. See costs for Shipping and Returns.
CANADIAN CUSTOMS - CANADA BORDER SERVICES AGENCY
THE OUTNET, a division of YNAP Corporation (hereinafter referred to as "THE OUTNET"), is an approved CREDITS participant with the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA).

Further, I also authorize DHL Express (Canada) Ltd. to forward any refund issued by the CBSA in my name, so that THE OUTNET can be reimbursed.
OUR POLICY
Items should be returned new, unused, and with all THE OUTNET and designer garment tags still attached. Returns that are damaged or soiled will not be accepted and will be sent back to the customer. Where provided, belts and any designer packaging such as authenticity cards, dust bags and leather tags should be included with your return. Please email customercare.usa@theoutnet.com if any of your purchases have been delivered without a THE OUTNET tag. You will need to inform us before you return a purchase. Unidentified returns will be returned to the sender.
EXCLUSIONS

BEAUTY
Gift boxes must be returned unused, unopened and in their original packaging otherwise we will not accept them.
FAULTY GOODS
Goods are faulty if they are received damaged or where a manufacturing fault occurs within six months of purchase. Items that are damaged as a result of normal wear and tear are not considered to be faulty.
If your item is faulty when you receive it, you can return it for a refund. Simply request a return and have the faulty goods sent back to us within 30 days of receiving them.
If you discover a fault after this time, but within six months of purchase, you can still return it. Where possible, we will offer to repair the item. If it cannot be repaired and the same product is still available, we will send you a replacement. If the same product is no longer available, you are entitled to a full refund.
If you would like to exchange a faulty item instead of obtaining a refund, please be aware that we can only replace it for the same product in the same size, subject to availability.

We have made every effort to display as accurately as possible the colors of our products that appear on the Site. We cannot guarantee that your computer monitor's display of any color will be accurate.
REPEATED RETURNS
