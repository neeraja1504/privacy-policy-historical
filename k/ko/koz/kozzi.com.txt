Tracking Technologies
Cookies
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do/do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.
Cookies offer users many conveniences when browsing our website. We use both session ID cookies and/or persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file.
Persistent cookies are used to retain certain personal preferences that users may have.
