Rakuten Kobo Inc. and its subsidiaries are part of the Rakuten Group, which includes the affiliates and subsidiaries of our parent company Rakuten, Inc., based in Tokyo, Japan (hereafter, “Kobo”, “we” “our” and/or “us”). More information about Rakuten is available at http://global.rakuten.com/corp/about/company.
We operate websites, mobile applications, a digital reading platform that enables customers to acquire and read or listen to written works (through ebooks, audiobooks or podcasts) using a variety of electronic devices, software applications , and other services (collectively, the "Kobo Services") and the account you use in association with the Kobo Services (the "Kobo Account").
This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes how we collect, use, and disclose Personal Information (as defined below) about you when you use your Kobo Account or any Kobo Services that link to this Policy, including Kobo Writing Life, the author self-publishing service.
Collection of personal information
"Personal Information" is any information or a combination of pieces of information that can reasonably permit you to be identified, or that can reasonably be linked to you. Information that is aggregated or de-identified so it is no longer reasonably associated with an identified or identifiable natural person is not Personal Information and may be used for any business purpose.
We collect Personal Information about you from a variety of sources. We collect information from you directly (e.g., when you contact us or create an account with us), automatically, (e.g., data collected via cookies and similar technologies when you use the Kobo Services), and from other sources, including commercially available sources, such as public databases (where permitted by law).
For example, we collect, process and use your Personal Information when you:
register for a Kobo Account or log into an existing account;
interact with the Kobo Services;
order products or content from us;
use the Kobo Services to access electronic content; or
contact us for customer care.
Registration and account information
When you create an account, you voluntarily provide us with certain Personal Information, such as your email address, and password.
Profile information
You may also complete an optional registration profile, which may include your name, gender, birth date, contact phone number and any additional optional information you choose to provide.
Payment information
We collect your payment information when you purchase e-content or sign up for subscription-based services.
Communications
We may also collect information you provide in your communications to us, such as when you respond to polls or surveys, write a review, or contact us with a question, comment, or request. You may choose to provide us with certain information when you upload e-content to the Services as a member of Kobo Writing Life, fill out a form, submit a request to our customer care team, respond to a survey, submit ratings and reviews or participate in promotions or contests.
Information we collect from your use of the Kobo Services.
Usage information
We collect Personal Information when you use or otherwise interact with the Kobo Services. For example, we collect information about how you use the Kobo Services, such as pages you view, the rate at which you consume e-content (how often and for how long), genres, authors or subject matter you prefer and searches you make or share, the ebooks or audiobooks you have liked, comments you have left and also websites you have viewed through links in the comments. We collect this information across the various devices, applications, and other tools via which you access and interact with the Kobo Services.

We may supplement the information we collect with information received from data suppliers and commercially available resources (e.g. demographic information and additional contact information).
Additionally, we may draw inferences about your preferences and characteristics from any of your Personal Information that we collect to develop a record of your potential preferences, characteristics, predispositions, behaviour, attitudes, intelligence, abilities, and aptitudes. We may automatically process your personal information to make decisions or conduct 'profiling' about you. This involves using software that is able to evaluate your personal aspects and predict risks or outcomes. We may carry out this automatic processing, for example, for the purposes of customer segmentation and pricing, and may involve decisions about you that relate to, for example, your browsing preferences. We may also make automated decisions about you based on your personal information in order to select personalized offers, discounts or recommendations to send you based on your shopping history, browsing history, preferences, or reviews. These types of decisions will not have legal or similar effects for you, but you can still contact us for further information.

Personal Information we Disclose

For example, we may partner with other companies to process secure payments, provide authentication services, optimize Kobo Services, fulfill orders, perform analytics, send our newsletters and marketing emails, support email and messaging services, administer our promotions, provide targeted advertising services as a processor to Kobo, and provide sweepstakes, contests, and surveys. Some of our service providers or business partners may engage their own service providers or business partners to further assist us. Unless otherwise specified, we require these companies to use Personal Information only for the purposes described in this Policy.
We may share your account credentials and other related Personal Information (such as, username, email address, encrypted password, first and last name) with the Rakuten Group companies.

Your data will only be shared if you chose to connect to another Rakuten ID service. By connecting to another Rakuten ID service, you direct the Rakuten ID services to share your data for the purposes explained in our joint privacy policy here: https://corp.rakuten.co.jp/privacy/en/rakuten-id/. We share your account credentials and profile information (address and date of birth, where provided) with the Rakuten ID services. This service is jointly provided by the Rakuten ID Services as directed by you, if you sign up with another Rakuten ID Service.
Law enforcement agencies, courts, regulators and government authorities
We may share the information we collect, including Personal Information, with law enforcement or to otherwise comply with any statutory or regulatory requirement or the order of a court or other public authority agency, regulator, government authority or other third party where we believe this is necessary to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation, or otherwise to protect our rights or the rights of any third party.
In the context of a transaction
We may share the information we collect, including Personal Information, with any third party that purchases, or to which we transfer, all or substantially all of our assets and business. Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to try to ensure that the entity to which we transfer your Personal Information uses it in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.
Legal basis for using your Personal Information.
Data Transfer
We may transfer your Personal Information to Rakuten Group entities and service providers located outside of your home country, including to countries outside the EEA for the purposes described in the subsections above (“How we may share the information we collect”). Your Personal Information may need to be processed in countries where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in your home country. Please note that we may be transferring your Personal Information to the United States of America, Canada, Mexico, France, the Netherlands, Ireland and Japan as well as other countries where we have active retailer partners and third-party business partners or service providers who may be data processors. In such cases, we will require the recipient to provide appropriate protection for the Personal Information disclosed to it, in compliance with applicable data protection laws.
We take great care in protecting your Personal Information and have put in place mechanisms to protect it when it is transferred internationally, consistent with applicable law.
As part of the Rakuten Group, Kobo relies on the Rakuten Binding Corporate Rules to legitimize international data transfers within the group. The Rakuten Binding Corporate Rules have been approved by the Data Protection Authority of Luxembourg acting as the lead authority and can be found at https://corp.rakuten.co.jp/privacy/en/bcr.html.
Additionally, for the transfers to Canada we rely on the Commission Decision 2002/2/EC granting adequate protection for personal data in Canada pursuant to the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, S.C. 2000, c.5., as amended (“PIPEDA”), and Canada’s anti-spam legislation, amending the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission Act, the Competition Act, PIPEDA and the Telecommunications Act (S.C. 2010, c. 23), as well as the Digital Privacy Act (S.C. 2015, c. 32) and certain provincial legislation deemed substantially similar to PIPEDA.
Legal basis for processing your Personal Information if you are in the EEA
If you use the Kobo Services while in the EEA, we must have a legal basis to process your Personal Information for the purposes above, including data received from social media platforms, data received from other sources used for statistics or data shared with third party advertisers.

Performance of a contract – The use of your Personal Information may be necessary to send you Emails and messages concerning the administration and operation of your Kobo Account and/or the Kobo Services.
Consent – We will rely on your consent to use (i) technical information; and (ii) your Personal Information for marketing and advertising purposes. You may withdraw your consent at any time by following an unsubscribe link in any marketing communication you receive from us.
Legitimate interests – We may use your Personal Information for our legitimate interests to improve our products and services and the content available on the Kobo Platform. These improvements are dependent on analyzing (for example) how you use the Services, such as pages you view, the rate at which you consume e-content (how often, and for how long), genres, authors or subject matter you prefer and searches you make or share, the ebooks or audiobooks you have liked, comments you have left, websites you have viewed through links, the success rate(s) of any promotion or event, certain technical information about your device, or when you access our application through a certain device, purchase path or transactional data and customer care interactions. We will also use your Personal Information for security purposes, and to share information with our affiliates for internal administration based on legitimate interest.
Legal obligation and public interest – Where compelled by applicable law, we may also have a legal obligation to collect your Personal Information, or may otherwise need your Personal Information to protect your vital interests or those of another person.
If we need to further process your Personal Information, we will let you know if there is a different legal basis for that further processing that is not compatible with the notices and consents that we have already from you, and we will provide you with any relevant further information and consent options.
Your choices and your rights over your Personal Information.

We may use cookies for a variety of purposes and to enhance your online experience, for example, by remembering your log-in status.

We also use first and third-party cookies. First party cookies are used and controlled by us to provide services for the Services. Third-party cookies are controlled by third-parties, mostly for analytics purposes.
