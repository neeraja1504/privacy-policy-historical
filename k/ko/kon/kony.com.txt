Web Beacons
Kony uses Web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about Customers and Visitors’ usage of the Company’s Web sites and interaction with emails from the Company. Web beacons are clear electronic images that can recognize certain types of information on your computer, such as cookies, when you viewed a particular Web site or Service tied to the Web beacon, and a description of a Web site or Service tied to the Web beacon. For example, Kony may place Web beacons in marketing emails that notify the Company when you click on a link in the email that directs you to one of the Company’s Web sites. Kony uses Web beacons to operate and improve the Company’s Web sites, Services and email communications.
Log Files, IP Addresses, URLs and Other Data
As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically to analyze trends in the aggregate and administer our Web sites and Services.  This information may include your Internet Protocol (IP) address (or the proxy server you use to access the World Wide Web), device and application identification numbers, your location, your browser type, your Internet service provider and/or mobile carrier, the pages and files you viewed, your searches, your operating system and system configuration information, and date/time stamps associated with your usage. Due to Internet communications standards, when you visit or use the Company’s Websites and Services, we automatically receive the URL of the website from which you came and the website to which you go when you leave our Website. This information is used to analyze overall trends, to help us improve our Websites and Services, to track and aggregate non-personal information, and to provide the Websites and Services. For example, Kony uses IP addresses to monitor the regions from which Customers and Visitors navigate the Company’s Web sites. Kony also collects IP addresses from Customers when they log into the Services as part of the Company’s “Identity Confirmation” and “IP Range Restrictions” security features.
Social Media Features and Single Sign-on
The Company’s Web sites may use social media features, such as the Facebook “like” button (“Social Media Features”). These features may collect your IP address and which page you are visiting on the Company’s Web site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. You may be given the option by such Social Media Features to post information about your activities on the Company’s Web site to a profile page of yours that is provided by a third party social media network in order to share with others within your network. Social Media Features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on the Company’s Web site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the Data Privacy Statement of the company providing the relevant Social Media features. Kony Customers can choose an external identity provider (e.g., Office365, Facebook Connect, Google) not only for how users authenticate within their customer-written applications, but also for how customers authenticate within  https://manage.kony.com. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign-up form.
Do Not Track
Currently, various browsers — including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari — offer a “do not track” or “DNT” option that relies on a technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to Web sites’ visited by the user about the user's browser DNT preference setting. Kony does not currently commit to responding to browsers' DNT signals with respect to the Company's Web sites, in part, because no common industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies or regulators, including no consistent standard of interpreting user intent. Kony takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard.
Public forums, refer a contact, and customer testimonials
Kony may provide bulletin boards, blogs, or chat rooms on the Company’s Web sites. Any personal information you choose to submit in such a forum may be read, collected, or used by others who visit these forums, and may be used to send you unsolicited messages. Kony is not responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in these forums.
Customers and Visitors may elect to use the Company’s referral program to inform contacts about the Company’s Web sites and Services. When using the referral program, the Company requests the contact’s name and email address. Kony will automatically send the contact a one–time email inviting him or her to visit the Company’s Web sites. Kony does not store this information.
Kony posts a list of Customers and testimonials on the Company’s Web sites that contain information such as Customer names and titles. Kony obtains the consent of each Customer prior to posting any information on such a list or posting testimonials.

Third parties with which we share your information are bound by all relevant data privacy laws, terms of confidentiality, and this Data Privacy Statement; however, Kony shall remain liable under the Principles if its agent processes such personal information in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless Kony proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

International transfer of information collected
The Company primarily stores Data about Kony Customers and Data about Kony Attendees in the United States. However, where applicable, if a customer purchases storage from Kony intended to store application data and requires that the application data is required to remain in a desired geographical region, Kony will comply in accordance to the contractual commitments. To facilitate Kony’s global operations, the Company may transfer and access such information from around the world, including from other countries in which the Company has operations.

Kony’s Customers may electronically submit data or information to the Services for hosting and processing purposes (“Customer Data”). Kony will not review, share, distribute, or reference any such Customer Data except as provided in Kony’s Master Subscription Agreement, or as may be required by law.

Security
We follow generally accepted industry standards such as firewalls and encryption and data privacy legal requirements to protect the information submitted to us, both during transmission and after we receive it, against loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no internet or e-mail transmission is ever fully secure or error free. In particular, e-mail sent may not be secure, and you should therefore take special care in deciding what information you send to us via e-mail. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any personal information to us or to any other party via the internet. You hereby acknowledge that we are not responsible for any intercepted information sent via the internet, and you hereby release us from any and all claims arising out of or related to the use of intercepted information in any unauthorized manner.
Mobile applications
Without limiting the generality of this Data Privacy Statement, in addition to information gathered through its Web sites or submitted to its Services, Kony may obtain information through applications (“Mobile Applications”) that Customers or their authorized individuals (“Users”) download to, and run on, their mobile devices (“Devices”). Mobile Applications provided by Kony may obtain information from, or access data stored on, Users’ Devices to provide services related to the relevant Mobile Application. For example, a Mobile Application may: access a camera on a User’s Device to enable the User to upload photographs to the Services; access the call history on a User’s Device to enable the User to upload that information to the Services; access calendar information on a User’s Device to enable the User to match meeting attendees with contacts submitted by the User to the Services; access the geographic location of a User’s Device to enable the User to identify contacts submitted by the User or the Services who are nearby; or access contact information on a User’s Device to enable the User to sync contact information between the information that is stored on the User’s Device and the information that is submitted to the Services. Information obtained to provide Mobile Application services may include information obtained in preparation for anticipated updates to those services. Mobile Applications may transmit information to and from Devices to provide the Mobile Application services.
Mobile Applications may provide Kony with information related to Users’ use of the Mobile Application services, information regarding Users’ computer systems, and information regarding Users’ interaction with Mobile Applications, which Kony may use to provide and improve the Mobile Application services. For example, all actions taken in a Mobile Application may be logged, along with associated information (such as the time of day when each action was taken). Kony may also share anonymous data about these actions with third party providers of analytics services. In addition, if a User downloads a Kony Mobile Application after clicking on a third-party mobile advertisement for the Mobile Application or for Kony, the third-party advertiser may provide Kony with certain information, such as the User’s Device identification information, which Kony may use to track the performance of its advertising campaigns.
Customers may configure Kony Mobile Application services, and the information accessed or obtained by the Mobile Application on a User’s Device may be affected by the Customer’s configuration. In addition, if a Customer purchases more than one Service from Kony and its affiliates, a Mobile Application may be designed to interoperate with those Services; for instance, to provide a User with access to information from any or all of those Services or to provide information from a User’s Device to any or all of those Services. Information accessed or obtained by the Mobile Application on a User’s Device may be accessible to the Customer and its organization, depending on the intended functionality of the Mobile Application. Kony may provide updated versions of its Mobile Applications. If your mobile device’s settings permit, those updates will be downloaded and installed automatically on your mobile device. By installing a Kony Mobile Application on your mobile device, you consent to the downloading and updating of that Mobile Application.
In addition to Mobile Applications offered by Kony, the Company may offer platforms for the creation of third-party Mobile Applications, including but not limited to the Kony platform. Third parties may obtain information from, or access data stored on, Users’ Devices to provide services associated with any third-party Mobile Applications that Users download, install, use, or otherwise interact with over a Kony platform. Kony’s Mobile Applications may also contain links or integrations to other Mobile Applications provided by third parties. Third parties’ use of information collected through third-party Mobile Applications is governed by the privacy statements of such third parties. The Company encourages you to review the privacy statements of third-party providers of Mobile Applications to understand their information practices.
Notices and contractual terms related to a particular Mobile Application may be found in the End User License Agreement or relevant terms of service for that application. The Company encourages you to review the End User License Agreement or relevant terms of service related to any Mobile Applications you download, install, use, or otherwise interact with to understand that Mobile Application’s information practices. The Mobile Application’s access to information through a User’s Device does not cause that information to be "Customer Data" under Kony’s Master Subscription Agreement with the Customer or under this Data Privacy Statement, except as follows: To the extent that a User uses a Mobile Application to submit electronic data and information to a Customer account on our Services pursuant to the Customer's Master Subscription Agreement with Kony (or a similar agreement that governs the Customer’s subscription(s) to Kony’s Services), that information constitutes “Customer Data” as defined in such agreement, and the provisions of that agreement with respect to privacy and security of such data will apply.
