K5 Learning is safe for your children
The student's area of our website (the pages your child uses after logging in) contains:
no advertising or commercial messages
no external links
no “chat”, message board or similar features
We strongly disagree with the amount of advertising targeted at young children, and we will never target your children with any sort of commercial messages.
We do not collect children's e-mail addresses or other contact information and we will never contact your child in any way.
Children's Privacy Guidelines
We do not collect any information directly from students other than the performance data they generate as they complete our lessons.
We do not give the ability for students to publicly post or otherwise distribute personal information.
We do not distribute to third parties any student's personally identifiable information without prior parental consent.
Performance Data
As your child completes lessons, we do record certain data (“Performance Data”) related to their interactions with the program (e.g. the score on a quiz). We will use Performance Data to measure your child’s performance and to adapt the lessons to his or her learning needs and provide you with progress reports about your child’s performance. In addition, we may aggregate your child’s Performance Data with the Performance Data of other children using our website for marketing and other business related purposes. Aggregate information will be anonymous and will not identify your child.
Education Partners
Certain of our lessons are licensed from third party education companies ( our “Education Partners”). Certain web pages delivered to the student when doing his lessons will be delivered from the servers of our Education Partners and certain links your child will use to initiate lessons will link to these servers. These web pages are customized for K5 and are considered to be part of our website for purposes of this Privacy Policy. Certain parts of your child’s Performance Data will be retained on the servers of our Education Partners. We do not share your or your child’s personal information with our Education Partners in any way that would allow them to personally identify you or your child or who the Performance Data belongs to. The policies and procedures of our Education Partners fully conforms with the provisions of this Privacy Policy.
