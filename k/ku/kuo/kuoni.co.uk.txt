What personal information do we ask for?
Whether you are booking a holiday, requesting a brochure, or joining our Online Travel Club, we will ask for your name, your postal address, your telephone and fax number and e-mail address.
If you are booking your holiday online, we'll also need your credit/debit card details (including card number, cardholder name, expiry date and start date for Mastercard) in order to take payment and confirm the booking on-line. If you're paying by debit card we may also need to take the start date and issue number of the card.
How does Kuoni use this personal information?
Brochure requests & online travel club:
We need your name, address and/or e-mail address so that we can send out your brochure order, and/or advise you of special offers/promotions we think you would be interested in. On all forms you will be given the opportunity to opt-out of receiving occasional marketing information from Kuoni.
If your name or contact details have changed, please send your new contact details to:aftersales@kuoni.co.uk.
If you no longer want to receive Kuoni marketing information, please click the unsubscribe link included in the footer of our emails, or send your customer reference, full address and email to  changes@kuoni.co.uk.
Online Bookings:
We need your name so we can confirm these details to the relevant hotels, airlines etc. who the booking is for.
We also need your address so that we can send you a confirmation invoice as well as your travel documents and in case we have to write to you about any part of your booking in advance of your holiday.
We would need your telephone number and e-mail address in the unlikely event that we need to contact you urgently about your booking.
We may also use this information to let you know about any special offers/promotions we think would be of interest to you.
You will be given the opportunity to opt-out of receiving such information on the booking form.
We may also use your IP (Internet Protocol) address to diagnose problems with our server and administer the site - monitoring visitor traffic patterns and site usage to help us develop and improve the Kuoni site further.
We need your credit card details so that we can collect payment for your booking.
Information you supply to us will be passed to our suppliers (such as airlines, hotels, transport companies) and agents only where necessary for the purposes of booking your holiday. This may include the transfer of information outside the EEA (European Economic Area).

Will Kuoni disclose any of this personal information to third parties?
Kuoni will only disclose your name and booking details/holiday proposal to our suppliers for operational purposes. We will not pass on your details to other companies for marketing purposes.
We won't disclose credit/debit card numbers unless we believe in good faith that the law requires it.
How does Kuoni protect customer information?
All the information you give us is protected by a secure server. The secure server software SSL (Secure Socket Layers) encrypts all information you enter before it is sent to us. The information is only de-encrypted when it reaches our server.
We also have a Firewall (security software) in place to protect our internal information from the Internet.
Kuoni use cookies on our website for a variety of reasons. We want our website to be as informative, personal, and user friendly as possible and cookies help us to achieve that goal.
Please note that  no attempts are made to identify individual users, store personal information and cookies cannot harm your computer.
You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. Please see information about how to do this below however this may prevent you from taking full advantage of the website.
What is a cookie
A cookie is a simple, tiny text file that is stored on a web browser when you visit a website that is incapable of performing any tasks or functions. When you revisit a web page, your browser checks to see if any cookies that are stored on your computer are valid ones for the page you are visiting. If they are, the information contained within them is sent back to that webserver.
Without cookies, you could visit two web pages and the website would not connect that you have seen both pages. It would look at the visits individually. Cookies will allow you to book a holiday online, contribute to a gift list or remember which hotel or resort you are searching for on a specific date to check availability and price. Kuoni uses cookies mainly because they make the browsing experience more efficient, enjoyable and provide relevant content.
Are cookies dangerous?
No. Cookies are small pieces of text. It is not a program, cannot be used as a virus or access your hard drive, and no other website can use it. Your browser will only share information in the cookie from the website that provided it.
Modern browsers allow users to set their own limitations to the number of cookies saved on their hard drives. To learn more about cookies, visit www.allaboutcookies.org.
Why do Kuoni use cookies?
Cookies let us identify the device you are using and how you use our website – but not you personally. They are essential for many features of our website to work, help us identify and resolve errors, monitor web traffic and identify which pages are being used to help us analyse data and improve our site. We only use this information for statistical analysis purposes and they in no way give us any information about you.
Kuoni’s cookies’ key features allow you to:
•   Store and review favourite items added to your ‘Travel Planner’ from whichever device you choose.
•   Check live price and availability, purchase a holiday, order a brochure or contribute/view your Kuoni Gift List.
•   Collect information and surveys so Kuoni can learn more about how you use our website and improve your online experience.
•   Provide you with relevant prices and offers on our own website and through our marketing activity.
•   Allow you to share holidays you are interested in among your choice of social media channels
Kuoni has good relationships with a small number of carefully selected suppliers who may also set cookies on behalf of us in order to improve our website and bring our customers information and offers that are relevant to you. If you would like more information about the cookies used by these suppliers, please see below.
Cookies cannot harm your computer and Kuoni will not use cookies to collect personally identifiable information about you.

How to modify your browser settings to decline cookies
Will Kuoni use the information I give for direct mailings?
Yes, but only on a small scale and we try to make sure they only contain information you wouldn't want to miss! If you find that you'd rather not have any contact with us, apart from that which is necessary for us to give you our normal level of service either use the opt-out boxes on the online registration/booking form or alternatively, please write to us at the address below.
If you have any questions relating to our privacy policy, or, if at any time you believe that Kuoni has not adhered to this privacy policy please let us know by sending an e-mail to webmaster@kuoni.co.uk. Alternatively write to us at Marketing, Kuoni, Kuoni House, Deepdene Ave, DORKING, Surrey RH5 4AZ.
