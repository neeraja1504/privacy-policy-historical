Such authorization is granted through the school’s acceptance of Kuder’s KCPS Terms and Conditions of Restricted Use License or another agreement executed by both Kuder and the particular school.
With respect to students under the age of 13, access by a third party to the data collection aspects of and the personal information collected through this Website is made available only to a student’s Authorized Educational Institution and, if applicable, any Jointly Administering Educational Institutions or Agencies (as those terms are defined below under “Use of Personal Information of Children Under 13”). Such Authorized Educational Institutions and, if applicable, Jointly Administering Educational Institutions or Agencies obtain such access only through their acceptance of Kuder’s KCPS Terms and Conditions of Restricted Use License or another agreement executed by both Kuder and the particular entity. Accordingly, each Authorized Educational Institution and, if applicable, any Jointly Administering Educational Institution or Agency utilizing the personal information collected by this Website has: (a) acknowledged that Kuder is acting as an agent of the Authorized Educational Institution in the collection of data from students under the age of 13, and (b) warranted that its use of such data will at all times comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998.
There may be instances where a child under the age of 13 desires to directly register to use this Website and a school at which the child is enrolled has not contracted with Kuder to act as an agent for the collection of personal information from the child as set forth above. IN SUCH INSTANCES, CHILDREN UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE MAY NOT REGISTER TO USE THIS WEBSITE WITHOUT KUDER FIRST RECEIVING AUTHORIZATION FROM A PARENT OR GUARDIAN. Parents of children under the age of 13 desiring to directly register to use this Website should contact Kuder’s Webmaster regarding the procedures for providing appropriate parental consent by written communication to Kuder, Inc., Attn: David Rawson, 302 Visions Parkway, Adel, Iowa, 50003, via telephone at (800) 314-8972, or via email at rawsond@kuder.com.
If Kuder receives a direct request from a child under 13 to use the Website, and Kuder has not received authorization from a parent or guardian, Kuder will utilize the child’s information solely for a one-time response to the child.
