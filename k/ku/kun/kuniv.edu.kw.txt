worms, Trojan horses and logic bombs. Users should be made aware of the
dangers of unauthorized or malicious software, and managers should, where
appropriate, introduce special controls to detect or prevent its introduction. In
particular, it is essential that precautions be taken to detect and prevent
computer viruses on personal computers.
Viruses and Malware are unauthorized programs that may replicate themselves
and spread to other computer systems across a network. The symptoms of
Virus infection include considerably slower response time, inexplicable loss of
files, changed modification dates for files, increased file sizes, and total failure
of a computer system.

4.3 Definitions
Definition of some of the common terms:
Authentication: The identification requirements associated with an individual
using a computer system. Identification information must be securely
maintained by the computer system and can be associated with an individual's
authorization and system activities. Three types of factors are used to provide
authentication: a) Something you know (i.e., a password) b) Something you
have (i.e., a certificate or smart card) c) Something you are (i.e., a fingerprint
or retinal pattern).
Availability: Ensuring that authorized users have access to information and
associated assets when required.
Confidentiality: Ensuring       that   information   is accessible only  to those
authorized to have access.

compromise of KUWAIT UNIVERSITY's entire corporate network. As such, all
users of KUWAIT UNIVERSITY’s information systems (including employees,
contractors and vendors with access to KUWAIT UNIVERSITY systems) are

complete records of the back-up copies and documented restoration
procedures, must be stored in a remote location, at a sufficient distance from
Kuwait University’s Data Center and other processing facilities to escape any
damage from a disaster at the main site.
11.6.1.5.3 At least two copies of fully recoverable version of all “critical” data must
be made. One copy must be stored at the Data Center or the main processing
facility whereas the other copy must be stored at an off-site storage location.

11.6.1.9       Determining factors influencing backup
11.6.1.10      Specifying the data to be backed up
11.6.1.10.1 The data of the IT system (IT application) required to be backed up must
be determined.
Description
This includes the application and operational software, system data (e.g.
initialization files, macro definitions, configuration data, text blocks, password
files, and access-right files), the application data as such and the protocol data
(such as that relating to log-ins and data transmissions).
11.6.1.11      Data Availability requirements of IT systems
11.6.1.11.1 The availability requirements for the data must be stipulated.
Description
A proven standard like the maximum permissible downtime specifies the time
period during which the specialized task can be performed without the
availability of the relevant data and without the need for resorting to backup
copies.
11.6.1.11.2 Consideration must also be given as to whether paper usage would allow
short- term continuation of operations without IT support.
11.6.1.12      Modification Volumes
11.6.1.12.1 The volume of data that is modified over a certain time period must be
considered while establishing the frequency of data backup.
11.6.1.13      Modification Times
11.6.1.13.1 Where data is modified continuously in a system, an appropriate data
backup frequency must be specified.
