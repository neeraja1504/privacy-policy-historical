Please read this Internet Privacy Policy carefully so that you understand what information we collect through our website, what we do with that information, and how to safeguard the personal information you provide to us.

INTERNET PRIVACY POLICY
Your personal privacy is a principal concern to us at KMA. Our goal in outlining our policy on the collection and use of listener/customer information is to ensure the highest level of confidentiality and security. When you provide your personal information on KMALAND.com, we will not give or sell your personal information to any outside company for its use in marketing or solicitation without your permission, which may be express or implied. We will maintain the confidentiality of your personal information and it will be used only to support your customer relationship with our radio stations and to assist us in providing better and more targeted services to you. Additionally, internal practices are in place to help protect your privacy by limiting employee access to and use of customer information. When we ask customers/listeners to provide their personal information on KMALAND.com, it is done with the goal of improving the relationship between KMA radio station and the listener. At KMA, we allow our listeners to maintain control over their personal information while attempting to provide a more interactive online experience. Our intention is to send e-mail only to listeners/customers who have chosen to receive such e-mails. At any time, you have the right to decline receiving future communications from KMA in any manner, including email, fax, telephone and postal mail.

IP addresses are not linked to any other personally identifiable information by KMA.
SECURITY
Access to listener/customer information is limited to those who specifically need it to conduct their business responsibilities. We use security techniques designed to protect our listener/customer information—especially information that is used by employees and business partners to fulfill listener/customer services. In addition to providing listeners/customers with the opportunity to refuse marketing offers, we release information only at the listeners'/customers' requests, or when required to do so by law or other regulatory authority. When a court order or subpoena requires us to release information, we notify the listener/customer directly so that his/her legal rights can be exercised, if appropriate. The only exceptions to this policy are when we are prohibited by court order or law from notifying the listener/customer, or cases in which fraud and/or criminal activity is suspected. Finally, each KMA employee is personally responsible for maintaining listener and customer confidentiality. All KMA employees are required to sign an agreement that they will comply with these policies. Employees who violate these policies are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. Employees are expected to report violations—and may do so confidentially—to their managers or other supervisors. Each radio station has an employee who has been assigned the responsibility for assuring the adherence to KMA's privacy policy.
