Collection of Your Information
Much of our website does not require any form of registration or identification. However, some functions of our website may require registration, such as those that necessarily require us to identify you in order to answer a question that you may ask. It is up to you to choose whether you want to register for any programs through our site which may be available to the general public (such as investor relations webcasts). It may not be possible for you to gain access to certain parts of the site that are restricted to certain registered users. If you register for a KBR program or service, or otherwise provide personal information to us through this website, KBR limits the collection of your personal information to that which is appropriate and proportionate for the intended use.  This may include, for example, your name, contact details, and other personal information relevant to the purpose for which you are visiting our website. We also  offer you the option to discontinue your consent ("opting out" or "unsubscribing") if you later decide that you no longer want to participate in the program or service.
