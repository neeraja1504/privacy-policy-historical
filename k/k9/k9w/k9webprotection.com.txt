BLUE COAT SYSTEMS, INC.
K9™ PRIVACY STATEMENT
FOR K9 WEB PROTECTION PERSONAL LICENSES
AND K9 SAFE SEARCH
Effective Date of this Privacy Statement: March 29, 2016
This statement describes how Blue Coat Systems, Inc. (“Blue Coat” or “we”) collects and uses your personal information, and how you can control certain uses of that information.
Scope of This Statement
This statement covers the personal information Blue Coat gathers when you access Blue Coat’s K9 Web Protection software and service ("K9") and K9 Safe Search (“Safe Search”, and collectively with K9, the “Services”).  For information about the personal information collected on the Blue Coat website or other specific programs, please see the Blue Coat Website Privacy Statement.  This statement does not cover K9 licensed under a commercial license; in that case, our corporate customer acts as data controller and has the obligation to provide notices to users. If you are using our Services under a corporate services arrangement, please check with your organization regarding its privacy practices and note that this statement does not apply to you. The Safe Search results are created with one or more third party search services (e.g. Yahoo! ™ Search), which is controlled by and subject to corresponding third party privacy statement(s).
Safe Harbor Program
Blue Coat is a participant in the Safe Harbor program developed by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Switzerland and the European Union. We adhere to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles agreed upon by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the E.U. For more information about the Safe Harbor and our certification, please see our General EEA/CH Safe Harbor Notice and visit the U.S. Department of Commerce's Safe Harbor website located at http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/.  If you have questions about Blue Coat’s participation in the Safe Harbor Framework, please send an email to privacy@bluecoat.com.
Collection of Personal Information Generally
As used in this statement, personal information includes information that may be used to identify you or another individual, such as a name and email address. We collect personal information in order to provide you with a better web experience, more customized emails, better products and services and to increase our responsiveness to customers and potential customers, as well as for the specific purposes and programs described below. This information may be gathered when you register for K9, use the Services or otherwise interact with us with regard to the Services.
Collection of Information through K9
Blue Coat collects personal information from you when you register to create a K9 account and when you use the K9 client.  The information Blue Coat may collect includes, for example, name, email address, installation date, uninstall date, last date seen, IP address for certain K9 requests (such as changing email address or requesting a password reset), K9 Version and Operating System, K9-generated license associated with your email address, the URL for which categorization is being requested, other meta-data about the request (such as referrer URL and user-agent (e.g., the browser type)), and the IP address of the resolved URL.  In addition, Blue Coat may collect other personal information (such as your phone number) through support requests.  Blue Coat will use such information to activate your K9 account and service, to provide you with the K9 service, and to provide you with new features and updates of the K9 service, in addition to the uses described below.
Collection of Information through Safe Search
No contact information is collected by Safe Search. Through Safe Search, Blue Coat collects information that your browser makes available. This information includes, for example, your Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, referral data and the date and time of your query.  Blue Coat will use such information to provide you with the Safe Search service.
Use of Information Collected Through the Services
In addition to activating your K9 account and providing you products and services, Blue Coat may use the information collected by the Services for the following purposes: to improve Blue Coat’s products and services, to inform you about products, seminars and services Blue Coat believes may be of interest to you; to contact you if Blue Coat needs to obtain or provide additional information; to comply with applicable laws and protect our and others’ legal rights; and to verify the accuracy of Blue Coat’s records.  Blue Coat may also use your information to send you, or to have our business partners send you, direct marketing information or to contact you for market research. We aim to obtain appropriate consent (where required under applicable law) to send you marketing communications.
We use standard technologies, such as cookies and other HTML tools as described in the Blue Coat Cookie Statement, which Blue Coat may amend from time to time. We do not allow third parties to collect personally identifiable information directly from users of the Services and currently we do not respond to ‘do not track’ signals or similar mechanisms.
Disclosure of Personal Information
Disclosure to Third Parties
Blue Coat may hire affiliated or unaffiliated service providers to provide services on its behalf, including packaging and delivery, sending postal and electronic mail, providing technical support, and processing event registrations. Blue Coat may disclose customer and prospect information to such third parties, and they may use such information on behalf of Blue Coat solely for the purposes for which Blue Coat provides it and under contracts that contain any protections for your data as required by law.
Blue Coat may rely on its channel partners, such as distributors and resellers, to fulfill product and information requests, and to provide customers and prospective customers with information about Blue Coat and its products and services. It may provide your personal information to those channel partners to enable them to contact you.
Blue Coat may engage in joint marketing activities and events with other manufacturers and solution providers, and may provide your information to such parties for the purpose of promoting or performing the activity or event.
Blue Coat may license, sell or otherwise transfer its technology or business, or a portion thereof, to third parties and, in connection with any such transfer, or other reorganization, it may transfer customer and prospect data related to the transfer, or potential transfer, to the transferee.
Except as expressly noted, Blue Coat does not rent, sell or lease personal information to other companies or individuals.
Because Blue Coat is a global company, your personal information may be shared with other Blue Coat offices or subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Asia and elsewhere. The data protection laws in these countries may be more or less restrictive than laws in the country in which you are located.

Disclosure for Compliance and to Protect Rights and Safety
Blue Coat may disclose your personal information if it has a good faith belief that such disclosure is required by law or necessary in order to conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process served on Blue Coat or the Services; protect and defend the rights or property of Blue Coat and the Services; enforce its agreements with you; or act in urgent circumstances to protect personal safety or the public.
Opting out of Marketing Communications
If you do not wish to receive marketing communications from Blue Coat, you can unsubscribe from future marketing communications by following the opt-out instructions contained in any such marketing communications or sending an e-mail to K9support@bluecoat.com.  Should you for any reason continue to receive unsolicited and undesired communication from Blue Coat, please forward the communication and your concerns to privacy@bluecoat.com.
Security and Accuracy of Personal Information
Blue Coat has implemented industry-standard security mechanisms and procedures in an effort to protect your personal data from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, but transmissions over the Internet are never 100% secure. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you provide to us, and we do not accept liability for unintentional disclosure.
