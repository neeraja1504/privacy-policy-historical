PRIVACY POLICY
This Privacy Policy is effective as of August 11, 2017.
Thank you for your interest in using the KeepandShare online services operated by Gee Whiz Labs, Inc. (" we " or " us "). We have prepared this Privacy Policy to explain to you how we collect, use, and share information we obtain through your use of our website located at www.keepandshare.com (the " KeepandShare Site "), as well as any of our other websites, email messages, mobile applications, or other software containing a link to this Privacy Policy (each, together with the KeepandShare Site, a " Site "), and any products or services offered through any of our Sites (collectively, the " KeepandShare Network "). It also describes the choices available to you regarding the use of, your access to, and how to update and correct your personal information. This Privacy Policy does not govern our use of any information you provide to us when you call us, write to us, or communicate with us in any manner other than through the KeepandShare Network.
By using the KeepandShare Network, you explicitly consent to the use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy and agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. In addition, if you are the master account holder of a multi-user license for the KeepandShare Network, you must ensure that each user under such license has given express consent to our collection, use, and disclosure of such information according to the terms of this Privacy Policy.
If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our support department at https://www.keepandshare.com/htm/contact_us.php
. Because the Internet is global, information about you that we collect or that you submit may be transferred to, processed in, and held in countries (including the United States) other than the one in which you reside. YOU EXPRESSLY CONSENT TO OUR PROCESSING OF YOUR NAME AND OTHER INFORMATION BY WHICH SOMEONE COULD PERSONALLY IDENTIFY YOU (WHICH WE WILL REFER TO IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY COLLECTIVELY AS " PERSONAL INFORMATION ") ACCORDING TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY. YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE PROCESSED BY US IN THE COUNTRY WHERE IT WAS COLLECTED AND IN THE UNITED STATES; UNITED STATES LAWS REGARDING PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE LESS STRINGENT THAN THE LAWS IN YOUR COUNTRY.

. As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. We do this to improve services we offer you.

We Gee Whiz Labs, Inc. and its partners use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functions on our website or service.
. We partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partner uses cookies and similar technologies to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other Web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking Here. Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.
.
. You can visit the KeepandShare Network without telling us who you are or revealing any other Personal Information. If, however, you wish to register to become a member of the KeepandShare Network, you are required to provide certain Personal Information (e.g., your name and e-mail address), and we ask that you also provide an account name and password. You may also choose to submit additional information about yourself (for example your city or state of residence) by which someone could not personally identify you (which we will refer to in this Privacy Policy collectively as " Non-Personal Information ").
. You may choose to submit documents, photos, calendar entries, other information, other content, or edits to any information or content to the KeepandShare Network (which we will refer to in this Privacy Policy collectively as "Stored Information") certain of which may be shared with other users of the KeepandShare Network as described in this Privacy Policy (in this Privacy Policy we will refer to Stored Information in your account that is shared with others collectively as " Shared Information ").
.
. We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy. We use your Usage Data, Personal Information, Non-Personal Information, Stored Information, and Shared Information (which we will refer to in this Privacy Policy collectively as "User Information") to fulfill your requests for products and services, to maintain and improve our services, to allow other users of the KeepandShare Network to find your account, to contact you from time to time about us, the KeepandShare Network, our products and services, and our newsletters, to update and enhance our records, to provide you with technical support, and to investigate and ensure compliance with our Terms of Service and other agreements relating to the KeepandShare Network.
.  From time to time, we may enter into relationships with third parties who provide services to us (e.g., data management and storage services or credit card processing services). In those circumstances, we disclose User Information that is necessary for such service providers to perform those services and require that they maintain the confidentiality of such User Information and are authorized to use such information only as necessary to provide these services to us.
.  The KeepandShare Network enables you to designate individuals with whom you would like us to share your User Information (which we will refer to in this Privacy Policy collectively as " Friends "), and enables you to identify, through the use of settings, which of your User Information will be available to which Friends. We may share your User Information with your Friends, however we will implement the settings you select with respect to how such information is shared (e.g., providing access, but not editing rights, to documents). By using sharing settings, you give people permission to access, download, embed on a website, link to, add to, edit, share, rate, review, comment on, and otherwise use Shared Information, as applicable. If you access another user's data, content, or other information through the KeepandShare Network (whether as a Friend, a guest, or otherwise), the KeepandShare Network may allow that user to see when and how you have accessed his or her data, content, and other information.
. So that other users of the KeepandShare Network can elect to designate you as one of their Friends, other users of the KeepandShare Network may search for your account by inputting all or a portion of your account name, first name, or last name, or your full email address. The KeepandShare Network may display certain of your User Information (such as your account name, first and last names, city, state, zip code, and country) in response to such searches, and may link to materials that you have made public under your account.
.  The KeepandShare Network will enable you to identify, through the use of settings, which of your User Information will be available publicly. If you identify any User Information as public, you are authorizing us to share such information publicly. For example, you may elect to make certain Stored Information (such as a calendar or photographs) publicly available. By choosing to identify any User Information as public, you understand and agree that anyone may access, disclose, index, archive, and otherwise use any information that you identify as public. If, for example, you make your email address public, someone else may try to send you unsolicited messages at that address. We are not responsible for the Personal Information you choose to identify as public.
. To remove unauthorized accounts, please send an email to privacy-notices@keepandshare.com.
.  Notwithstanding anything in this Privacy Policy to the contrary, we reserve the right, and you hereby expressly authorize us, to share any User Information: (1) to comply with applicable law, including in response to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements; (2) to establish, protect, or exercise our legal rights or to defend against legal claims, including to enforce our Terms of Service or any other agreement relating to the KeepandShare Network; (3) to address third party complaints of infringement or violation of any copyright, trademark, or other legal right; (4) if we believe it is necessary, to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding actual or suspected illegal activities, fraud, or situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person or property, including our own; (5) if we believe it is necessary, to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding significant abuse of the KeepandShare Network, its infrastructure, or the Internet in general (such as voluminous spamming, denial of service attacks, or attempts to compromise the security of information); (6) to our parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control with us (in which case we will require such entities to honor this Privacy Policy); (7) if we become the subject of bankruptcy proceedings, in which case we may share information about you and your usage with a bankruptcy trustee, debtor in possession, or subsequent purchaser of assets; and (8) if we are acquired by or merged with (or in discussions regarding being acquired by or merged with) another entity, to such entity.
. We do not control or manage the sharing or publication of information by users through the KeepandShare Network, and such users may possibly disclose Personal Information of other users or of third parties.
. If you use the KeepandShare Network through a multi-user license, the master account holder under that license will have access to the User Information stored in and relating to your account and will have administrative control over your account. Among other things, the master account holder will be able to set and revise the sharing controls on your account, log into your account, and change the password to your account. In addition, we may provide to the master account holder periodic reports of activity under your account.
.
. If you choose to use our guest sharing service or our 'Invite a Friend' referral service or Email This, we will ask you for your friend's email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email , identifying you as the source of the invitation and inviting them to join the site. Your friend may contact us at  to request that we remove this information from our database.
. If another user of the KeepandShare Network invites you to access their data, content, or other information as a guest or invites you to the KeepandShare Network, they will provide your email address to us, and that email address will be associated with a username (which may be based on the first ("local") part of your email address) and a guest password that we provide to you. We store this information for the purposes of sending this one-time email, giving you access to your account, communicating with you about your account, and notifying you of changes to the KeepandShare Network or the terms applicable to it. If you wish, you may follow the instructions in the welcome email to close the account or instruct us to not send you any further emails.
. We allow you to add your friends', family's, and other contacts' names, email addresses, and other contact information to your account so that you may reference this information at any time.  In addition, if you send an email to the email address of a third party recipient through the KeepandShare Network, you may have the ability to save that email address to your account. We will use this contact information to store it for you, to share it for you on your request, and to send emails to your contacts on your request. If you wish to delete any of your friends', family's, and other contacts' contact information from your account, you may do so by accessing the contact within your KeepandShare Network address list and clicking "Delete Address".
. We may from time to time post user testimonials on our Sites which may contain Personal Information.  We will seek your consent if we post a user testimonial that contains your Personal Information.
.  We offer you the opportunity to choose not to receive communications from us. If you would like to take advantage of this opportunity, please let us know by accessing and updating your account settings. You may opt-out from receiving marketing or newsletter email communications at anytime by clicking on the unsubscribe link located within each email communication. Please note that sometimes these requests may take up to ten business days to process. Even if you do take advantage of this option, we reserve the right to send you administrative messages relating to the KeepandShare Network (e.g., about changes to this Privacy Policy) and to contact you regarding any of your transactions with us.
Upon request KeepShare Network will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information. If you would like to modify or delete from our database any User Information (other than Usage Data) you previously submitted to us, please let us know by accessing and updating your profile in your account settings. We will use our commercially reasonable efforts to fulfill your request in a timely manner. However, even if we delete such User Information from our 'live' database, it may still be stored on other databases (including those kept for archival purposes). We may keep a record of all information that is changed or deleted, and we may determine what may be changed or deleted. For example, if we are required to keep track of certain kinds of transactions, you may be prevented from changing or deleting information relevant for those transactions. Please note that if you delete certain information, you may not be able to use certain features of the KeepandShare Network in the future without re-submitting such information. We are not responsible for removing information about you from the databases of any third parties to whom we were authorized to disclose your information prior to processing your request that we restrict the display or disclosure of this information.
We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services contact us at . We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
. We have implemented reasonable measures to help protect your User Information from loss, misuse, or unauthorized access or disclosure, and when you enter certain sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). However, you should know that no company, including ours, can fully eliminate security risks associated with the disclosure of Personal Information. Neither people nor security systems are foolproof, including encryption systems. In addition, people can commit crimes, make mistakes, or fail to follow policies. As a result, while your privacy is very important to us, we cannot fully ensure that your Personal Information (or any other of your User Information) will not be disclosed to third parties. If applicable law imposes any non-disclaim-able duty with respect to your information, you agree that the standard used to measure our compliance with that duty will be one of intentional misconduct. If you have any questions about the security of your personal information, you can contact us at privacy-notices@keepandshare.com.
.  The KeepandShare Network is not intended for storage, display, or transmission of any "protected health information" as defined in the federal regulations implementing the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), or any similar state or federal law. Accordingly, the privacy and security provisions of this Privacy Policy should not be interpreted to incorporate any data protection standards of the HIPAA regulations.
.  The KeepandShare Network may contain links to other websites and may enable you to use third party products and services. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and practices applicable to any such other website or such third party products or services and urge you to review such policies and practices prior to submitting any information to such websites or in connection with such third party products and services.
