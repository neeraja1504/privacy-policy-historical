You may give us information, including information that can identify you ("personal information"), when you use our Websites, correspond with us, or enter into any of our competitions, promotions, sweepstakes or surveys. Where we request information from you, we will collect the information set out in the relevant forms or pages. You may choose to provide additional information to us when you contact us or otherwise interact with us.
If you purchase any products through the Websites you may be required to create an online account (your "Account"). You are also able to create an Account with us without placing any orders. You may also be able to place orders without creating an Account via the "Guest Checkout" feature.
The information that you provide when setting up your Account may include your name, email address and telephone number. If you register to hold an Account with us, you will also have a unique username and password which enables you to access your Account.
Please note that we will not be storing your payment information, which will be processed and stored by a third party payments company (e.g. PayPal or Paymentech), although we may store certain information like your billing address and the last 4 digits of your card number.
If you subscribe to receive our newsletter, then you will provide us with your name and email address (and possibly even your relevant interests!) although you may optionally also provide your gender and date of birth.
If you contact us via email then we will collect your email address.
You may also submit personal information in connection with photos/stories/videos for our potential use and/or publication (for example, as part of competitions) or via reviews or our message boards. We may use some of these in marketing campaigns but if we do we will ensure that you are made aware of such use prior to the campaign going live and given an opportunity to understand the intended use and, if you choose, object to the use.
The personal information that you provide to us will be used for the purposes made clear to you at the time you submit your information, for example for enabling you to use our Websites and placing orders online and/or for administrative and troubleshooting purposes, and, as explained in section titled "Information we receive from other sources,” we may also use this information for further purposes when combined with other data we collect about you.
We and our third party marketing partners may also use the information you send to us for our marketing purposes, if this is in accordance with your marketing preferences. However, you will always be able to opt-out of our marketing at any time (see the "How to opt in or opt out of direct marketing" section below).

Legal basis for processing personal information (EEA visitors only)
If you are a visitor from the European Economic Area, our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.
However, we will normally collect personal information from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests (such as the prevention of fraud or provision of direct marketing) and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person. If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contact with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information).
If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us at the address found in the "Contact Us" section below.

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
