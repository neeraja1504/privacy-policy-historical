Web Beacons
Our Site and emails may contain web beacons in order to help us better manage content on our Site.
Our Site and some third-party sites and HTML-formatted emails use web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about your website usage and your interaction with email. A web beacon is an electronic image, called a single-pixel (1×1) or clear GIF. Web beacons can recognize certain types of information on your computer such as cookies, the time and date of a page viewed, and a description of the page where the Web beacon is placed. You may be able to disable web beacons in email messages by not downloading images contained in the message you receive (this feature varies depending on the email software used on your personal computer). However, doing this may not always disable a web beacon or other automatic data collection tools in the email message due to specific email software capabilities.
For more information about this, please refer to the information provided by your email software or service provider. If you choose to receive marketing emails or newsletters from KeepTruckin, we may automatically collect personal information about you. For example, through web beacons and personalized URLs embedded in these emails or newsletters, KeepTruckin can track whether you’ve opened those messages and whether you’ve clicked on links contained within those messages.

Third parties may provide us with PII they have collected about you from you or from further online and offline sources, such as marketing data from our partners and third-parties that is combined with information we already have about you, to provide you with more relevant communications and better tailored offers. We are not liable for any processing of your PII by such third parties prior to, during or after them providing it to us. We may combine such PII with the PII we already have about you to provide you with a better experience, evaluate your interest in our products or improve the quality of our products and services.
