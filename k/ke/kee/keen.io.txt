Online Data Collection Technologies?
Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the sites or service providers systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. We use cookies in order to implement authentication and to enable core features of our application, as well as to enable us to better understand user behavior. We use cookies to compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future. We may contract with third-party service providers to assist us in better understanding our site visitors. These service providers are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf except to help us conduct and improve our business. If you prefer, you can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies via your browser settings. However, if you turn your cookies off, most of our services may not function properly.
Do we disclose any information to outside parties?
We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information except as follows:
To trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential.
When we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others rights, property, or safety. We also may be required to disclose an individual’s personal information in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
In addition, if we ever decide to sell our business we may provide the information to a potential acquirer but only to the extent customary in these circumstances and subject to the potential acquirer’s agreement to maintain the information in confidence and use it only for the purpose of evaluating the potential acquisition.
We provide non-personally identifiable visitor information to others for marketing, advertising, or other uses. In limited circumstances we permit these third parties to further share this non-personally identifiable information with others for the purpose of assisting others in developing their online advertising and marketing strategies. For example, we may permit a data service to associate the de-identified data we provide with other information it may have about you. The data service would then use the combined data to provide data services to other website operators and advertisers to assist them in more effectively targeting their content and advertising. Please see the section below captioned Online Behavioral Advertising to learn about behavioral advertising practices or to opt out of this type of advertising.
We will provide an individual opt-out or opt-in choice before we share your data with third parties other than as described above, or before we use it for a purpose other than which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized.
