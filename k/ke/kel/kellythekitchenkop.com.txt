Affiliates, Disclaimers, Privacy Policy, Terms and Conditions - Kelly the Kitchen Kop
WHY DO SOME POSTS HAVE A LOT OF LINKS? (Affiliate policy)
For every person who says, “ Why so many links? “, there are many more asking, “ Where can I find that?! ”
Some of these links may be affiliate links, which means if you click on them and buy something, I get a small piece of that sale at NO additional cost for you.  I truly appreciate when you do this, because it's a way to help me continue sharing free content with you here on the blog.  Keep in mind that I'm very picky about what I endorse and who I work with, because these are foods or products I use myself or for my own family.
If you have benefited in any way from this site and the time spent gathering, researching, organizing, writing & maintaining the information you find here (and in many cases emailing or messaging with you privately to try and help, which I am happy to do!), then making your purchases through the links for recommended food or products is a way to say thanks.  🙂  This helps pay for the ongoing expensive cost of keeping up the site, whether it's web hosting, domain renewals, programs needed for different features, paying assistants to help keep it up, or any number of daily problems that arise.  Just as there are many repairs needed around your home, the same is true of a website.
AT THE BOTTOM OF EVERY POST/PAGE ON THIS BLOG:
Please note this paid endorsement disclosure (the FTC makes me put this here):   “ In order to support this site, I may receive monetary compensation for my endorsement, recommendation, testimonial and/or link to any products or services from this blog or social media posts. ”  This includes Amazon or other affiliate links either here or on social media, as well as other paid sponsor links, but there is no additional cost if you click through these links and make a purchase, and often you’ll even get a discount.
Also a disclaimer:   “ The information found here has not been approved by the FDA and is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.”   This notice is required by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
Copyright information:  All material found on this site is copyright protected and may not be copied or used without permission.

You should also note that although many of the links out of my site are purely for informational purposes, the Kitchen Kop or Christianity 101 site does earn a commission or advertising revenue on many such links including those to books, giveaways, products, e-courses and services.  Sometimes this also includes participation in sponsored posts or twitter and/or facebook activity.   KellytheKitchenKop.com or Christianity101blog.com accepts paid advertisements including but not limited to CPC (cost-per-click) advertisements and banner advertisements; and also participates in affiliate programs.  KellytheKitchenKop.com and Christianity101blog.com participate in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com.  Giveaways at KellytheKitchenKop.com or Christianity101blog.com are often sponsored and KellytheKitchenKop.com or Christianity101blog.com may receive revenue or product for conducting giveaways.

Comments are welcomed and encouraged at KellytheKitchenKop.com or Christianity101blog.com.
While I try to answer and respond to every question within comments, it is not always possible.
Do your best to keep comments clear and concise.  Few people have time to read a 500-word comment.
Do not serial comment (post comment after comment after comment); rather, keep all your thoughts together in one posted comment unless you are replying to individual comments.
All comments containing links are automatically moderated, and marked as spam if they do not adhere to this comment policy.
You may use the URL field to promote the primary URL of your blog or website, but this is subject to moderation and deletion by admin if it is spammy.
Do not post self-promoting links to your blog, website or business within the body of the comment AND do not use affiliate links in comments.  That's just bad taste and will result in removal.  This includes links to similar recipes you have posted on your blog.  If readers want to hear more from you, they’ll visit your website from the URL you posted in the URL field.
Liability: All comments within this blog are the responsibility of the individual commenter. By submitting a comment on this blog, you agree that the comment is your own, and to hold this site and all post authors and commenters harmless.

What To Do If Your Comment Does Not Appear: Please be patient. Comments are sometimes moderated and cannot always be approved right away. Please do not submit the same comment unless you think your original comment was not submitted correctly the first time.
Do not attempt to sell products or direct readers to your site for purchasing your products.
Keep your comments up-beat, positive, supportive and intellectually engaging.
By all means, disagree with each other (and me), but do so in a respectful and intelligent fashion.
Hate speech, name-calling, mean-spirited and derogatory comments will be marked as spam.
Copyright/Plagiarism: If notice is received that a comment contains proprietary, copyrighted or plagiarized information, that comment will be deleted and the commenter may be blocked from further commenting.
Comments may be removed or edited at my discretion.
Email addresses are required for commenting, and they are not shared publicly.  They may be used by the website owner to privately contact the commenter.
Never share private information in a comment.
Comments using the Lord's name in vain will be immediately removed.  That just won't fly around here.
