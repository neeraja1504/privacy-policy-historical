A. Cookies, Web Beacons and IP Address Information
“Cookies” are small pieces of information that a website places on your browser when you visit that website. Cookies may be used to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience with the Site and Services. For example, cookies may be used to control what advertisements you see, the sequence of advertisements and to make sure you don’t see the same advertisement too many times. For polls, cookies may be used to help ensure that an individual can’t vote more than once on a particular question or issue. We do not store Personal Information in any cookies on your computer.
Cookies can be removed by following your Internet browser’s directions within the help tab. In order to use certain Services offered through the Site, your web browser must accept cookies. If you choose to disable cookies, some aspects of the Site may not work properly, and you may not be able to access our Services.
Cookies, pixels, web beacons (which are usually small, transparent graphic images), operating system and device information and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) may be used to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit, the features and information for which you searched and viewed, the email you opened or on which advertisements you clicked. This type of information is collected to make the Site and Services more useful to you and to tailor the experience with us to meet your special interests and needs.
An “Internet Protocol Address” or “IP Address” is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. We, or our service providers, may use your IP Address when you access the Site or Services or use other means to assist with delivering geographically targeted content and advertisements.
B. Targeted Advertising
EHM and other companies that we work with may use cookies for purposes including understanding web usage patterns of users who see advertisements on the Site, controlling the sequence of advertisements you see, making sure you don’t see the same advertisement too many times, determining your interests and tailoring advertisements and promotions based on those interests. For example, if you read an article about a particular health condition on the Site, cookies from a vendor may be used to later serve you an advertisement for a product related to the viewed article. These third party vendors may connect information about pages you visit on our Site with information about pages you visit on other websites and show you advertising based on this combined information. The advertisement may appear when you are visiting a different section of the Site or any other website on the Internet if the website also has a relationship with our vendor.
You can choose to limit Behavioral Advertising on the Sites by clicking here and opting-out of cookies placed by those vendors listed. After you opt-out, you will still see advertisements but the advertising may not be as relevant to your interests. If you change your computer, change your browser, or delete your cookies, you will need to renew your opt-out. The Site currently is not setup to process or respond to “Do Not Track” settings or signals from web browsers.
We do adhere to the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising of the Digital Advertising Alliance (for more information click here).
C. Information Collected by Third Party Advertisers
Advertisers or other third parties on the Site may also engage in Behavioral Advertising and use cookies and web beacons in the manner described above. We do not control these advertisers or other parties’ use of cookies or web beacons or what they do with the information they collect. Many third party vendors that engage in Behavioral Advertising participate in the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) and abide by NAI and/or DAA principles. If you wish to opt out of participating in advertising programs conducted by NAI and DAA members or learn more about the NAI and DAA, please go to the NAI Opt-Out website and DAA Choice Page and follow the instructions. After you opt-out, you will still see advertisements, but the advertising may not be as relevant to your interests. If you change your computer, change your browser or delete your cookies, you will need to renew your opt-out.
