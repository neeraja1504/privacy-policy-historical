How KenKen Collects Information
KenKen collects non-personal information along with personal information when you actively provide it in the context of various activities including online purchases, registration and marketing surveys. In addition, we and other third parties use cookies and other technologies to passively collect non-personal demographic information, personalize your experience on our sites and monitor advertisements and other activities. We may also derive from the information collected other facts, such as determining the applicable tax rate based on your IP address. To collect this information, KenKen may use various industry-standard information gathering techniques and technologies such as browser cookies (including flash cookies, also known as “local shared objects”), clear GIFs, tracking pixels, and internet log files. We may also use analytics technologies to collect non-personal information when you use our products and services to collect and analyze information relating to your use of our products and services and to better personalize your user experience.
KenKen’s websites, products and services may employ third party ad serving technologies that use cookies, clear GIFs, web beacons, tracking pixels or other technologies to collect information as a result of ad serving through our products or services as well as to help track. We or third parties operating the advertisement serving technology may use demographic information such as age and gender as well as information logged from your hardware or device to ensure that appropriate advertising is presented within the site, product or service and to calculate or control the number of unique and repeat views of a given ad, or deliver ads that relate to your interests and measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns. We or third parties may log various data for this purpose and the data may be used and disclosed per this Privacy Policy and the privacy policy of the company providing the ad serving technology and to other third parties in a form that does not personally identify you.

Sharing Your Information
KenKen will never share your personal information with third parties without your consent. We may, however, share anonymous, non-personal, aggregated or public information with third parties.

We may also access and disclose personal information, including personal communications, in connection with report abuse functions in our products and services, to enforce legal rights and comply with the law, or to comply with an order from a government entity or other competent authority, or when we have reason to believe that a disclosure is necessary to address potential or actual injury or interference with our rights, property, operations, users or others who may be harmed or may suffer loss or damage, or when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, combat fraud or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on KenKen.
Protection of Information
The security of your personal information is important to us. We use generally accepted methods to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and in storage. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.

Public Information Including User Generated Content
You may choose to disclose information about yourself in the course of contributing user generated content to KenKen sites or products or services, message boards, user “profiles” for public view or in similar forums on our sites or on third party sites. Information that you disclose in any of these forums is public information, and there is no expectation of privacy or confidentiality. You should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit in the course of these public activities can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.

Note also that in the ordinary course of Internet activity, certain information may be sent from your browser to third parties such as advertising networks and analytics companies. KenKen has no control over the information sent from your browser to those networks or other third parties and recommends that you ensure that your browser settings prevent the disclosure of information you would not like to share.
Third Party Sites
Our website may contain advertising or services which link to other websites such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. The fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party. If you click on a link to a third party site, including on an advertisement, you will leave the KenKen site you are visiting and go to the site you selected. Because we cannot control the activities of third parties, we cannot accept responsibility for any use of your personal information by such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy and security practices as KenKen. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any other service provider from whom you request services. If you visit a third party website that is linked to a KenKen site, you should consult that site’s privacy policy before providing any personal information.
