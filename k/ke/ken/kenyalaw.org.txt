5. **  The Information We Collect**
a) Non-Personal Information Collected and How it is Used
Our Web Site is not set up to automatically collect personally identifiable information from each visitor to our Web Site. It does recognize the home server of visitors,but not e-mail addresses. For example,we can tell which Internet Service Provider our visitors use,but not the names,addresses or other information about our visitors that would allow us to identify the particular visitors to our Web Site. The technical information we do collect is used only for internal purposes by our technical support staff.
Our Web Site does track certain information about the visits to our Web Site. For example,we compile statistics that show the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Web Site and its individual pages. These aggregated statistics are used internally to improve our Web Site and for product development and marketing purposes generally. Those aggregated statistics may also be provided to advertisers and other third parties,but again,the statistics contain no personal information and cannot be used to gather such information.

Providing such information is completely optional. However,failure to provide it may mean that you cannot access and use certain information,materials and services.
For example,we request information from you when you:
Log-on to certain areas of our Web Site,such as the kenyalawreports.or.ke Research System,where you may be prompted to provide us with your Kenya Law Reports ID number and password as a condition to gaining access to certain information,materials or services

The National Council for Law Reporting uses your personal information only for specific purposes. The personal information you provide to us when using our Web Site,such as your name,postal or e-mail address or telephone number will be kept confidential and used to support your customer relationship with Kenya Law Reports,and to notify you of special offers,updated information and new products and services from Kenya Law Reports,or offers from third parties that we think may be of interest to you. Agents or contractors of Kenya Law Reports who are given access to your personal information will be required to keep the information confidential and not use it for any other purpose than to carry out the services they are performing for Kenya Law Reports.
Kenya Law Reports may enhance or merge your personal information collected at its Web Site with data from third parties for purposes of marketing products or services to you.
