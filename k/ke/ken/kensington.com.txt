This Privacy Policy was last modified and is effective as of April 10, 2018.
ACCO Brands Corporation, its subsidiaries and affiliated entities (collectively, “ACCO Brands” or “we” or “us”) recognize that you care how your information is collected and used. We have created this Privacy Policy to inform you of how we collect, use and share this information. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to be sure you understand its terms. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us here.
1. Scope of this Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy applies to websites (including mobile websites), mobile applications and other digital platforms which are owned or managed by ACCO Brands and which contain or refer to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “Digital Services”). It also applies to information collected through other channels that are NOT Digital Services, such as through our customer support services. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any of ACCO Brands’ websites (including mobile websites), mobile applications and other digital platforms to which it is not posted or to third-party websites and platforms, even though the Digital Services may link to such websites and platforms. You can learn more about links from the Digital Services in the “Links to Other Sites” section.
This Privacy Policy describes our practices regarding both personal information and non-personal information. For purposes of this Privacy Policy, personal information is information that can be used to identify or contact a particular individual, for example: full names, addresses, and email addresses. Non-personal information, by itself, cannot be used to identify or contact a particular individual.
2. Your Consent and Agreement
This Privacy Policy forms part of your legal agreement with ACCO Brands under the Terms of Use applicable to the Digital Services. By using the Digital Services, you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy, you should not use the Digital Services.
3. Modifications to this Privacy Policy
ACCO Brands may modify this Privacy Policy from time to time. Whenever this Privacy Policy is revised, we will update the “effective date” at the beginning of the Privacy Policy. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy each time you use the Digital Services to see if the Privacy Policy has been revised since your last visit. If we make a material change to this Privacy Policy, we will post a notice on the Digital Services. By using any of the Digital Services after the effective date of any changes, you agree to the terms of the Privacy Policy as modified.
4. Collection of Information

In some instances, you may be able to choose which information the Social Media Platform shares with us. In other instances, the Social Media Platform, determines what information about you is shared with us. If you are already logged in to the Social Media Platform when you visit the Digital Services, the information may be provided to us automatically by the Social Media Platform.
We may combine the information received from the Social Media Platform with other information we have about you. We recommend that you review the privacy policy of each Social Media Platform you use for more information about their privacy practices, and how to adjust your settings on that Social Media Platform to meet your preferences.
