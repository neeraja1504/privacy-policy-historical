1. Information Collection and Use
Personal Information
Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable such as your name, address, email address, or phone number, or other information that is not otherwise publicly available, including information related to your usage of the Kennedy Center's products and services.
You may visit and browse the Kennedy Center's websites as often as you like without logging in and no personal information about your visit will be collected.
While you are logged into your Kennedy Center account to purchase tickets or use other online services, you are not anonymous to us online. The Kennedy Center collects personal information when you make a purchase or a contribution online, register an account, utilize our network, request information about our products and services, participate in a promotion or an online survey, contact the Kennedy Center with a question or suggestion, apply for employment with the Kennedy Center, and when you attend certain special events where heightened security is necessary.
How Information is Collected
__We may ask you to provide specific information._ _ Depending on the nature of your interaction with the Kennedy Center, we may ask you for information such as your name, phone number, physical address, birth date, company related information, email address, credit card information including expiration date and billing address, and product preferences. Under certain less common and special circumstances, we may ask you for other information such as your social security number. In such cases, we will inform you of the reason we are requesting that information and how it will be used.
__We may use Cookies, tracking tags and other technology._ _The Kennedy Center uses cookies and other tracking mechanisms across our websites and social media platforms. These technologies work by sending a small amount of data from our websites which is stored on your computer's hard drive ("cookies"). Our site can then read this cookie, which helps us keep track of how you use our websites and remember your preferences. Many web browsers accept cookies by default but contain an option for you to turn off cookie acceptance if you prefer. If you turn off acceptance, there may be some features of our websites that will not be available to you and some webpages may not display properly.
In addition, the Kennedy Center incorporates tracking or measurement tools into our websites and other communications which enable us to track your browsing activity on Kennedy Center websites as well as across social media platforms or other non-Kennedy Center websites and applications (known as "tracking tags", "web beacons," "action tags" or "single-pixel gifs"). If you utilize services which are linked to these tracking tags, these third-party services may also provide non-personal information to the Kennedy Center about your activity on non-Kennedy Center websites and social media platforms, which we may utilize to increase the effectiveness of our promotional efforts and to personalize our services and offerings for you.
Cookies, tracking tags, and embedded third-party features provide overall usage patterns for our websites that we use for analysis and to provide personalized services and advertising content.   Your browsing may be tracked by these third-party services for their own use and for their clients.  Such tracking could give information about you as an individual to third-parties based on your browsing activity, but this information will not include personal information unless you specifically provide it.
The ability of tracking tags to gather and use your information through any * third-party services is governed by that service's privacy policy, which may differ from the Kennedy Center's policies.   The Kennedy Center is not responsible for the privacy practices or the use of the data collected by these third-party services. *
How Information is Used
First and foremost, the Kennedy Center uses any information you provide to us to provide you with products and services such as online ticket and gift shop purchases, newsletter subscriptions and other specifically requested information and activities. In addition, we may perform (or have third parties perform) analyses of visitors' behavior, and may share data with sponsors, advertisers, and collaborators.
Your personal information may be used by us (or third parties engaged by us) to: (1) customize the advertising and the content that you see, (2) fulfill your requests for products and services, (3) contact you, (4) conduct research, (5) respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process, and (6) establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.
Certain performances at the Kennedy Center are produced or presented by third parties. When you make a purchase to a performance presented or produced by one of these third party organizations, the Kennedy Center may provide them with information regarding your purchase. This information may include, but shall not be limited to, your name, address, telephone number and email address, as well as details of your purchase, which may include, but shall not be limited to, the date you purchased your tickets, any offer you responded to, the locations of your seats, and the dollar amount of your transaction.
We will on occasion share information gathered from our patrons with selected third party vendors who assist the Kennedy Center with promoting and marketing our programs and services. This might include customer research, management of customer databases, promotional mailings or other targeted promotions. This information may include your name, address, e-mail address, site usage data and purchase information.
In addition the Kennedy Center may provide your name and address or phone number to third parties whose products we believe may be of interest to you (although we do not share any other information about you, the selection criteria may result in the third party being able to identify your relationship with the Kennedy Center in a broad manner, i.e., that you are a subscriber or donor, or may have attended a particular production). You can request at any time that we do not share your name and address or phone numbers with such third parties. The Kennedy Center does not monitor or control the privacy policies of such third parties.
2. Anonymity
