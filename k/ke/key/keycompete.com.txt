SSL Certificate
HRgems, Inc is protected by an SSL Certificate issued by Network Solutions, a trusted internet innovator for over 10 years. SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer, which is the standard security technology for creating an encrypted link between a web server and a browser. This link ensures that all data passed between the web server and browser remains private and secure. All Secure Link SSL certificates from Network Solutions are encrypted at 128 bits, which is the highest encryption level available. Your will know you have created an SSL link with our web server during the checkout process by seeing the “https://” at the beginning of the URL, as well as seeing the padlock icon (available in most but not all browsers) in the lower right-hand frame of your Web browser.
Powerful 128-bit Encryption
128-bit encryption means that the data cryptographically encoded during an SSL session is at the highest level currently available, and nearly impossible to break. Compared to a 40-bit encrypted SSL certificate, a 128-bit is more than 300 septillion (300,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000) times stronger. All Secure Link SSL certificates from Network Solutions are encrypted at 128 bits.
