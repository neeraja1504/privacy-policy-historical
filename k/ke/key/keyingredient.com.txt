What Personal Information Do We Collect Through Our Sites?
There are several ways we collect personal information through our Sites:
Information You Provide. We collect the personal information you knowingly and voluntarily provide (about yourself and others) when you use our Sites, for example, the information you provide when you sign up to become a Member of KeyIngredient, when you create or update your Member profile on KeyIngredient, and when you make a purchase on one of the Sites.
Information Sent to Us by Your Web Browser. We collect information that is sent to us automatically by your Web browser. This information typically includes the IP address of your Internet service provider, the name and version of your operating system, the name and version of your browser. the date and time of your visit, the address of the Web page you were visiting when you accessed our Site, and the pages you visit. Please check your browser if you want to learn what information your browser sends or how to change your settings.
The information provided by your browser does not identify you personally. However, we may review our server logs for security purposes, such as detecting intrusions into our network. If we suspect criminal activity, we may share our server logs – which contain visitors' IP addresses – with the appropriate investigative authorities who could use that information to trace and identify individuals. In addition, if you have created a "user identity" during one of your visits, we may link the information provided by your browser to information in our database that identifies you personally.
Information Collected Using "Cookies" and Other Web Technologies. We use "cookies," and similar technologies to collect information and manage and support our Services. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web server. Cookies cannot be used to install computer programs or deliver viruses to your computer. We may use two types of cookies -- "session cookies" and "persistent cookies."
A "session cookie" assigns a randomly-generated, unique identification number to your computer when you access one of our Sites. A session cookie expires after you close your browser. Generally, we use session cookies to collect information about the ways visitors use our Sites – which pages they visit, which links they use, and how long they stay on each page. This information is known as "click-stream information." Session cookies may also be used to facilitate your interactions with our Sites.
We may also use "persistent cookies." These cookies do not expire when you close your browser, but stay on your computer until they expire or you delete them. Each time you visit one of our Sites, our Web server will recognize you by "searching" the information contained in these cookies. By assigning your computer a persistent, unique identifier, we are able to create a database of your previous choices and preferences. This permits us to offer you a personalized experience when you use our Sites. Assigning your computer a persistent, unique identifier also helps us keep a more accurate account of how many people visit our Sites, how often they return, how their use of our Sites may vary over time, and the effectiveness of our promotional efforts.
Neither session cookies nor persistent cookies identify you personally. If, however, you have created a user identity on one of your visits to our Sites, we may link the information collected by our cookies to information that identifies you personally.
If you do not wish to receive cookies, you may set your browser to reject cookies or to alert you when a cookie is placed on your computer. You may also delete our cookies as soon as you leave our Site. Although you are not required to accept our cookies when you visit our Sites, if you set your browser to reject cookies, you will not be able to use all of the features and functionality of our Sites.
In addition to cookies, we may also use "web beacons" and other web technologies to manage our Sites and email. A web beacon is a small bit of computer code. Web beacons may be used to count how many people visit a web page or tell us whether an email has been opened. We may link the information we collect using web beacons and other web technologies to information that identifies you personally.

Further, you agree that by posting Your Content on or through our Services, you are granting Key Ingredient the right, with no obligation, to use your name, photograph, and geographical location (e.g. city and state) in connection with Your Recipes when Your Recipes appear or are broadcast on KeyIngredient, on other Web sites or in other media as described above.
