At Blockdot, Inc.. ("Blockdot"), we respect your right to privacy and we understand that visitors to Blockdot Sites need to control the uses of their personal information. The privacy policy below details the measures taken by Blockdot to protect your privacy in connection with your use of  www.kewlbox.com, www.blockdot.com, and other sites owned and operated by Blockdot ("Blockdot Sites"). Blockdot does not intend to collect any personal information from children under 13 unless Blockdot believes such collection to be permitted by law; please read below for Blockdot's policy with respect to children under 13.
How is my personally identifiable information used by Blockdot?
Customized experience. Blockdot gathers user information to provide you with a customized experience on our sites. Your user information helps us tailor the content, services, goods and advertising to your current and future needs. For this reason, we may ask you to register or to provide personal information when you post high scores, write reviews, download free software, enter a contest, order products, subscribe to a newsletter and/or visit certain areas of an Blockdot site. If you choose not to register you may not have access to areas that require personal identification.
E-mail. If you register with our site or purchase products from us, from time to time we may e-mail you with messages about our services or third party products and services we believe may be of interest to you, such as new products, features, services, special offers and updated information. The newsletters may contain code that enables our database to track your usage of the newsletters, including whether the e-mail was opened and/or what links (if any) were clicked. We will combine that information with other information we have about you and may use that information to improve your site experience and/or provide customized e-mail communications to you. In addition, if you register with a Blockdot site or purchase products you may automatically receive emails confirming your registration and/or purchase and providing you with necessary information relating to the access or use of your registration and/or purchase. With the exception of the emails described in the preceding sentence which are necessary to provide customer support and deliver products and services to you, you may opt-out of receiving e-mail from us as described below under "What are my options to control the use of my personally identifiable information?".
When does Blockdot collect my information, including personally identifiable information?
Registration. When you register, Blockdot asks for your e-mail address, a user selected user name, and other information. Once you are a registered user you can update your profile and may be able to provide additional preferential information (e.g. a member name, a nickname, and certain user preferences). (Blockdot's policy with respect to children under 13 is below)
Order Forms and Products Store. Blockdot also uses an order form for users to request information, products and services. For that order form, we collect a user's contact information (e-mail address) and necessary financial information to process the order (i.e. credit card number). Contact information from the order (including e-mail) is used to deliver digital products and information from Blockdot. Blockdot may use third parties to accept and process orders and credit card purchases for merchandise and products, including software.
Special Contests or Promotions. Blockdot may occasionally present a special contest or promotion that is sponsored by another company. To qualify for entry in that contest or promotion, we may ask you to provide personal information. If we plan to share that information with the sponsor(s) or with others, we will provide a statement to that effect in the contest or promotion terms.
IP Address. All communication on the internet takes place between pairs of IP Addresses. Our Web servers will log the IP address that any connection is made from. We may use these IP addresses to help diagnose technical problems or prevent abuse of our systems or other site users. Your IP address may also be used to gather aggregate demographic data and target advertisements accordingly.
Cookies. A "cookie" is a small line of text that is stored with your Web browser for record-keeping purposes and to help us provide better service to you.

By delivering ads on the Blockdot Sites, the ad server is able to record what ads a user -- identified by the unique cookie -- has seen, and what Blockdot site pages the user was viewing when the ads were delivered. This Web usage information is combined with other ad delivery information the ad server has collected from your visits to Blockdot Sites and other sites not affiliated with Blockdot. This non-personally identifiable information is used as part of the ad serving process for reporting and to select and direct the ads you see online at Blockdot Sites and other sites not affiliated with Blockdot.

Who does Blockdot share information with?
We will not share your personally identifiable information with third parties, aside from entities that perform services for us, such as fulfilling orders or processing payment, that either are bound to comply with our privacy policy or have privacy policies that protect your information unless you have "opted-in" to such sharing. If you have previously opted-in to such sharing under a prior privacy policy version, you are still considered to have opted-in under this Privacy Statement. As stated, and whether or not you have opted-in, Blockdot may use third parties to accept and process orders for merchandise and products, including software, and such third parties may get access to your personal information for the purposes of providing services or products to you on Blockdot's behalf. In addition, if you Opt-Out, as discussed below, we may share that information with third parties who send emails on our behalf so that they do not e-mail you.
However, Blockdot may disclose information you provide if required to do so by law or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with legal process served on Blockdot; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of Blockdot; or (3) act in an emergency to protect someone's safety.
We may request demographic information from you (for example, your age, education level or household income) from time to time. We will not share that information in a manner that identifies you as an individual with any other entity, unless we let you know that at the time of collection or we have your permission. When we share demographic information with third parties, we will give them aggregate information only.
In the event that Blockdot is acquired by another company, your personal information may be part of the assets transferred to the acquiring party.

We maintain records of those users who Opt-Out of specific e-mail options so that we do not e-mail them with respect to those types of emails and we may share this information with third parties who send emails on our behalf so that they do not e-mail you; this information may also be contained in web logs (see above).
What about kids' personally identifiable information?
The Blockdot Sites are general audience sites and are not directed to children under the age of 13. Blockdot assumes products purchased through credit card means are purchased by adults. Blockdot respects the privacy of parents and children and is committed to complying with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). On those areas of the Sites that ask for age, Blockdot does not collect personal information from individuals who identify themselves as under the age of 13 except in those limited circumstances where Blockdot believes that such collection is permitted under COPPA.
If a parent believes that his or her child has submitted personal information to Blockdot, he or she can contact us via e-mail or postal mail as listed below. Blockdot will promptly delete the information upon learning that it relates to a child under the age of 13. Please note that it is possible some of this information may remain archived in web logs and back-up archives after Blockdot deletes the information from its active database (see the Web Logs paragraph above, and the Archived Information paragraph below).
Blockdot believes that parents should supervise their children's online activities and consider using parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers that help provide a kid-friendly online environment. These tools can also prevent children from otherwise disclosing online their name, address and other personal information without parental permission.
What else should i know about my privacy?

These include a firewall to prevent unauthorized access to our systems and maintenance of registration information in a separate database.

We will protect the transmission of credit card information through industry standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption.

Blockdot may offer chat, user reviews, multi-player games, bulletin board, or other public functions and any posting by you is considered public information available to other users.

Tell a Friend. If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site or particular features or content, we ask them for the friend's name and e-mail address. Blockdot will automatically send the friend a one-time e-mail inviting them to visit an Blockdot Site. Blockdot stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time e-mail.
