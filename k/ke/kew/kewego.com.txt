This online privacy policy (Privacy Policy) describes the types of information Piksel, Inc. (Piksel, we, or us) gathers from those persons visiting the Internet website www.piksel.com (the Site) and how we use that information. By accessing this Site, you agree to be bound by the Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use this Site. Piksel reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes to the Privacy Policy will be posted on the Site and the effective date of the most recent version of the Privacy Policy will be modified to reflect the effective date of the most recent version.
1. GENERAL
We may collect two types of information from users of our Site: personally identifiable information (such as name and e-mail address) and aggregate information (such as frequency of visits to the Site, search terms entered, Site pages most frequently accessed, browser type, etc.).
2. COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION
We collect personally identifiable information that is voluntarily provided by users of the Site when users want to subscribe to our newsletter or would like for a Piksel representative to contact them. If you want to receive our newsletter, you will be required to provide your e-mail address. If you would like for a Piksel representative to contact you, you will be required to provide your name, email address and/or telephone number. We may also collect any other personally identifiable information that a user submits during the course of normal correspondence with Piksel. The information collected and received is used to provide requested services to users and visitors to the Site and may be used for marketing purposes if you elect to receive such communications.
3. COLLECTION AND USE OF AGGREGATE INFORMATION
We also collect aggregate information, which is non-personally identifiable/anonymous information, from all users of the Site. Aggregate Information is used in a collective manner, and no single person can be identified by that compiled information. We use aggregate information to help us develop and improve our Site and to improve visitors experiences on the Site.
4. COLLECTION AND USE OF IP ADDRESSES
In addition, we collect IP addresses to obtain aggregate information on the Site. An IP address is a number assigned to your computer by a web server when you are on the web. When you are on our Site, we have a back-end server that logs your computer’s IP address. We only use the information we find out from tracking IP addresses in the aggregate, such as how many users entered a specific area of our Site, and not to track a specific IP address to identify an individual user. However, we may use such information to identify a user if we feel that there are or may be safety and/or security issues or to comply with legal requirements.
5. SHARING, SELLING, AND TRADING PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION COLLECTED ONLINE WITH THIRD PARTIES
We will not share, rent, sell or otherwise disclose personally identifiable information collected on the Site to third parties for such parties own marketing and promotional purposes.
In the following circumstances we may share or transfer personally identifiable information collected on the Site to unrelated third parties: (i) to comply with a legal requirement, judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on us, (ii) to investigate a possible crime, such as fraud or identity theft; (iii) in connection with the sale, purchase, merger, reorganization, liquidation or dissolution of our company; or (iv) when we believe it is appropriate to do so to protect the rights, property, or safety of visitors to our Site or other persons.
6. SHARING, SELLING AND TRADING AGGREGATE INFORMATION COLLECTED ONLINE WITH THIRD PARTIES
We may sell, share or trade compiled aggregate information relating to activity on the Site, with third parties for marketing, research and other purposes. No single person can be identified by such aggregate information.
7. MESSAGE BOARDS/BLOGS
On the Site, we provide a blog section where visitors can post comments and messages for others to read. We may collect technical information about your post, such as the IP address from which you posted, and associate this information with your comments. Even if comments are deleted, we may retain copies and attendant information indefinitely.
When you post comments to the blog section of the Site, certain personally identifiable information may be available to the public. You will be given the option to post your comments anonymously. Also note that any personally identifiable information you include in the body of your comments will be available to the public so it is important for you to exercise discretion and appropriate caution when deciding to reveal personally identifiable information in these areas.
