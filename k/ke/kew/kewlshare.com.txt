Privacy Policy
OutBeast operates several websites including Outbeast.com It is OutBeast’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.
Website Visitors
Like most website operators, OutBeast collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. OutBeast’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how OutBeasts visitors use its website. From time to time, OutBeast may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
OutBeast also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. OutBeast only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.

Those who engage in transactions with OutBeast – by purchasing access to our service, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, OutBeast collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with OutBeast. OutBeast does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
