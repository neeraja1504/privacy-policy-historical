privacy policy
Ketchum Inc. and its affiliated companies (“ we ”, “ us ” or “ Ketchum ”) are committed to safeguarding your privacy and protecting your information against unauthorized use. The following statements explain the policies we adhere to regarding the collection of data on our site https://ketchum.com/ (“ Web site ”), information security, and privacy standards. BY USING OR ACCESSING THE WEB SITE, YOU SIGNIFY YOUR AGREEMENT TO BE BOUND BY TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR OTHERWISE USE THE WEB SITE.
Personal Information:
Providing your Personal Information to us is completely voluntary. “ Personal Information ” is information that can specifically identify you.  We do not collect Personal Information unless you submit that information to us, including when you send us your resume through the Web site, or otherwise participate in our interactive features on the Web site.   Additionally, we may also collect certain other types of information that, along with Identity Data Contact Data, and Financial Data may be considered and specifically named “personal data” in certain jurisdictions including the European Union (“ EU ”).
Categories of Personal Information we collect include:
name
contact information
date of birth
government-issued identification information, passport or visa information
educational history
employment and military history
legal work eligibility status
information about job performance and compensation
financial account information
IF YOU ARE SITUATED IN THE EU, PLEASE SEE THE SECTION “ADDITIONAL EU DISCLOSURES” THAT PERTAIN TO OUR COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA AND ADDITIONAL RIGHTS YOU HAVE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.
Non-Personal Information:
In addition, we may also collect information that is not Personal Information (“ Non-Personal Information ”).  We may aggregate Personal Information so that the aggregated information does not personally identify you or anyone else, such as by using Personal Information to calculate the percentage of our visitors who live in a particular area (“ Aggregate Information “). Because Non-Personal Information does not personally identify you, we may collect, use and disclose Non-Personal Information for any purpose permitted by law and subject to the section titled “Additional EU Disclosures”.  In some instances, we may combine Non-Personal Information with Personal Information.  If we combine any Non-Personal Information with Personal Information, the combined information will be treated by us as Personal Information.
Information Usage and Disclosure:
Besides using your Personal Information ourselves, we may send your Personal Information to other companies, affiliates and third parties to help us process your Personal Information for the purposes set out in this policy.
We use Personal Information and other information as described herein:
to contact you about our (and our affiliates) products and services and provide you with our products and services
to personalize your experience with us including by presenting products or services tailored to you
to allow you to use, communicate and interact with others on our Web site
to respond to your direct inquiries
to add you to our mailing lists and send you emails from time to time
We will not sell your Personal Information to any third party not affiliated with Ketchum without your consent except in connection with the sale or merger of Ketchum or the division responsible for such services.
Additionally, we may disclose Personal Information and other information as we believe necessary or appropriate: (a) under applicable law, including laws outside your country of residence; (b) to comply with legal process; (c) to respond to requests from public and government authorities including public and government authorities outside your country of residence; (d) to enforce our terms and conditions; (e) to protect our operations or those of any of our affiliates; (f) to protect our rights, privacy, safety or property, and/or that of our affiliates, you or others; (g) to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain; and (h) for legitimate business interests.
We may use Aggregate Information and Non-Personal Information to improve and enhance your experience on the Web site and for our market research activities. For example, and subject to section titled “Additional EU Disclosures”, we may share Aggregate Information and Non-Personal Information with unaffiliated third parties, such as business partners, manufacturers, distributors and retailers, in a form in which means the shared information will not contain nor be linked to any Personal Information.
Please note that if you specifically consent to additional uses of your Personal Information, we may use your Personal Information in a manner consistent with that consent. Finally, we reserve the right to supplement your Personal Information with information we gather from other sources which may include information we gather from online and offline sources.
Security:
The security of your Personal Information is very important to us.  [We attempt to provide for the secure transmission of your information from your computer to our servers by utilizing encryption software.] However, due to the inherent open nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that communications between you and Ketchum, or information stored on the Web site or our servers, will be free from unauthorized access by third parties such as hackers and your use of the Web site demonstrates your assumption of this risk. We have put in place reasonable physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect.  Only those employees who need access to your information in order to perform their duties are authorized to have access to your Personal Information.  If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us in accordance with the Contact section below.
Data Retention:
We will retain your information for as long as needed to provide you with the Web site and for a reasonable time thereafter in accordance with our standard procedures or as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, and to enforce our agreements. Even if we delete some or all of your Personal Information, we may continue to retain and use anonymous or aggregated data previously collected. Please note that we will not be liable for disclosures of your data due to errors or unauthorized acts of third parties.
Protection for Children
Our Web site is intended for ages 18 and over. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children.  When we become aware that Personal Information (or other information that is protected under applicable law) from a child under 13 (or such other age as may be restricted under local law) has been collected, we will use all reasonable efforts to delete such information from our database.
Other Web sites and Social Networking Services:
Our Web site may contain links to other web sites not maintained by Ketchum. Other web sites may also reference or link to our Web site.  The inclusion of a link on the Web site does not imply endorsement of the linked site by us.  We are not responsible for the privacy practices of websites operated by third parties that are linked to or integrated with our Web site, or for the privacy practices of third party Internet advertising companies. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our Web site, or surf the Internet, and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that you visit.
The Web site may integrate with social networking services.  You understand that we do not control such services and are not liable for the manner in which they operate.  While we may provide you with the ability to use such services in connection with our Web site, we are doing so merely as an accommodation and, like you, are relying upon those third party services to operate properly and fairly.

We will process your request within a reasonable time after receipt.  Please note that if you opt out in this manner, certain aspects of the Web site may no longer be available to you.
Changes to policy:

By providing your email address to us, you expressly consent to receive emails from us.  We may use email to communicate with you, to send information that you have requested or to send information about other products or services developed or provided by us or by others that we believe will be of interest to its audience.  If you receive an unwanted email from us, you can simply reply and ask not to receive future emails.  We also give you the option to remove your Personal Information (and other information required by law) from our list of active users completely.  All unsubscribe or opt-out requests should be sent to us at privacy.policy@ketchum.com and we will process your request within a reasonable time after receipt.  We are not responsible for removing your information from the lists of any third party who has been provided your information in accordance with this policy, such as a business partner.
