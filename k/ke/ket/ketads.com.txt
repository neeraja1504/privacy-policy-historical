KetAds Mobile Advertisement - Page Site
Ketads is committed to respecting and protecting individuals' privacy rights.
This Privacy Policy explains how KetAds Pte Ltd, its subsidiaries and affiliated companies (collectively, "Ketads" or "we", "us", "our") use end users (“you” or “your”) your personal and device-related information when
(i) you view ads served by Ketads on third party websites or mobile apps (see the section below called "Ketads Ad Network"), and
(ii) you visit the Ketads website at www.ketads.com (see section below called "Ketads Website").
Ketads ADVERTISING & AUDIENCE PLATFORM
WHAT IS THE Ketads AD NETWORK?
We partner with third party website publishers and mobile app developers to serve ads on their sites and in their apps. These ads are customised to their users' interests and geographic locations, which we infer from information we collect about how those users interact with sites and apps that have partnered with Ketads (this type of advertising is often called "interest-based advertising" or "targeted advertising"). This enables our partnering publishers and developers to provide content-rich services that are more relevant to their users, often using the advertising revenues they generate to offer their services for free or at a subsidised cost.
WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?
When you view an KetAds ad on a site or app which uses our services, we may collect information about your device or the ad that you have viewed. This information does not enable us to work out your identity in real life, but does enable us to recognise your device when you use other sites and apps that have partnered with us.
Specifically, we may collect:
(a) Information about your device
We may collect some or all of the following information about your device: device type (e.g. smartphone, tablet, etc.), operating system (e.g. iOS, Android, Windows, Blackberry), network provider, Internet (IP) address, which mobile browser you use (e.g. Safari, Internet Explorer etc.), the carrier user ID (a number uniquely allocated to you by your network provider), platform, SDK version, timestamp, API key (identifier for application), application version, iOS Identifier for Advertising, iOS Identifier for Vendors, Media Access Control (MAC) address, International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI), Model, manufacture and OS version of device, session start/stop time, locale (specific location where a given language is spoken), time zone, and network status such as WiFi, the geo-location of your device (using GPS or other geo-location data) and the unique device identifier of your mobile device (a number uniquely allocated to your device by your device manufacturer).
(b) Information about the ad you have viewed
We also collect some or all of the following information about the ad you have viewed:
(i) the content type of the ad (what the ad is about, e.g. games, finance, entertainment, news);
(ii) the ad type (e.g. whether the ad is a text, image, or video based ad);
(iii) where the ad is being served (e.g. the address of the website on which the ad appears); and
(iv) certain information about post-click activity in relation to the ad (e.g. whether you proceed to purchase the product or service advertised).
On occasion, our partnering mobile publishers or app developers may also disclose to us information they have separately collected about you so that we can improve the relevance of the ads we serve on their behalf. They do this in accordance with their own specific privacy policies and subject to their own applicable legal requirements. We do not use the information they provide to us for any purpose other than serving you with interest-based ads on their behalf.
There is certain data that although not personally identifiable we consider sensitive, such as viewing of sites with sexual content or information indicating a users’ specific medical condition. We do not use these types of sensitive data from one site for tailoring ads at other sites across our network.
HOW DO WE USE INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT?
We use the information we collect to display interest-based advertising customised to individuals’ inferred interests, preferences and locations, and to perform analysis aimed at improving our services and technologies. The information we collect also helps us to provide filtering options for publishers and developers to manage ads appearing on their sites and in their apps, and to provide targeting options for advertisers. This helps our publishers and developer clients, for example, not to present you ads that you have already seen, and helps our advertiser clients serve adverts that are most likely to be of interest to you.
WHO DO WE SHARE INFORMATION WITH? With Publishers, Developers and Advertisers
We share the information we collect from your visits to partnering sites and apps with our publisher, developer and advertiser clients. We anonymise this information using one-way hashing (i.e. scrambling) technology and encrypt it securely before sharing it. These measures preserve your anonymity and mean that our clients cannot identify you in real life from the information we share. Our clients use this anonymised information to better understand their site and app traffic usage so that they can refine and improve their services.
Sharing Info with Third Parties
From time to time, we may need to disclose your information to third parties such as to law enforcement authorities or our legal advisers, where it is necessary to comply with the law or regulation; enforce or apply our user terms and conditions; to protect our rights, or to preserve the safety of our users. This may include exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection.
We may also share your personal information in connection with any merger, a sale of KetAds assets, or a financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company. Whenever we share your personal information for this reason we will ensure that the recipient is bound by all appropriate confidentiality obligations and that it commits to using your personal information only for the purposes for which you originally provided it.
HOW DO WE KEEP INFORMATION SECURE?
KetAds uses appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect the information it collects about you and your device. In particular, we anonymise all information we collect using one-way hashing technology and encrypt it securely before sharing it with any third parties.
HOW LONG DO YOU KEEP INFORMATION FOR?
We retain information collected on third-party applications and web sites for a period of 90 days, unless otherwise required by law. After 90 days we further anonymise the data by aggregating it before storing it for analytical purposes.
INFORMATION COLLECTED ON BEHALF OF THIRD PARTIES
KetAds may offer advertising solutions to clients that include the collection of voluntary information from you as part of an advertisement, e.g. serving an ad that contains an advertiser questionnaire. All of the information that you voluntarily provide in response to the advertisement shall be collected by KetAds and forwarded directly to the relevant client and will be governed by that client's privacy policies in place from time to time.
