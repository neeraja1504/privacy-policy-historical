For customers and individuals who participate in research conducted by our customers, we may disclose:
Your information to our service providers: We use service providers who help us to provide our customers with our services. We give relevant persons working for some of these providers access to your information, but only to the extent necessary for them to perform their services for us. We also implement reasonable contractual and technical protections to ensure the confidentiality of your information and data is maintained, used only for the provision of their services to us, and handled in accordance with this privacy policy. Examples of service providers include hosting services, transcription or translation services, and data cleaning services. Note that we may be liable for the appropriate transfer of EU and/or Swiss personal data to third parties.
Aggregated or de-identified information to third parties to improve or promote our services. No individuals can reasonably be identified or linked to any part of the information we share with third parties to improve or promote our services.
Your information if required or permitted by law.

If required, KnowledgeHound will notify the applicable data protection agency in each jurisdiction of such a transfer in accordance with the notification procedures under applicable data protection laws.
What are my rights to the information you collect?
For KnowledgeHound Customers
Your research data is owned by you. Not only that, but KnowledgeHound treats your research data as if it were private. We don’t sell this data to anyone and we don’t use your research data for purposes unrelated to you or our services, except in a limited set of circumstances (e.g. if we are compelled by a subpoena, or if you’ve given us permission to do so).
In addition to the above, you have the following rights:
Access and correct your Personal Data. KnowledgeHound acknowledges the right of EU and Swiss individuals to access their personal data. As a registered user, you may access and correct certain personal information that KnowledgeHound holds about you by contacting your Customer Success representative. Some users (including those whose information we receive under the EU-U.S. and Swiss-US Privacy Shield) have certain legal rights to obtain information of whether we hold personal information about them, to access personal information we hold about them, and to obtain its correction, update, amendment or deletion in appropriate circumstances. In all cases, requests to exercise these rights may be directed to our Privacy Officer (please see contact information towards the front of this policy). These rights are subject to some exceptions, such as where giving you access would have an unreasonable impact on the privacy of other individuals. We will respond to your request to exercise these rights within a reasonable time and, where required by law or where we deem it otherwise appropriate and practicable to do so, we will honor your request.
Download/backup your research data. We provide you with the ability to export, share and publish your research data in a variety of formats. This allows you to create your own backups or conduct offline data analysis.
Delete and send back your research data. You may delete your research data for any particular research study at any given time from our system by contacting your Customer Service Representative.

Contact the Customer to access and correct your Personal and Survey data. Because we collect research provided by our customers, you will need to contact the customer if you have any questions about the research conducted, or if you want to access, update, or delete anything related to your Personal data collected in the research. You may request access to and correction of the personal data we hold about you by contacting our Privacy Officer, but in most cases KnowledgeHound cannot provide you with this access since all data related to the research we collect is our customer’s private information and giving you access may have an unreasonable impact on the privacy of other individuals. We will respond to your request for access or correction within a reasonable time and, where reasonable and practicable to do so, we will provide access to your personal data in the manner requested by you.
