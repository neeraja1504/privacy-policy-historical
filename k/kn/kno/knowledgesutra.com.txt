KnowledgeSutra will never contact users directly through a physical address or by phone, and such information is securely stored after being reviewed.
Users should be aware that KnowledgeSutra is lawfully required to provide personally identifiable information to law authorities, such as the Internet Police as requested, if a criminal offence whether related or non-related to KnowledgeSutra and/or its community has been committed. Additionally upon breach of KnowledgeSutra's Terms Of Service, KnowledgeSutra is required to contact and report the offence to all parties involved in the violation, including but not limited to the violator's Internet Service Provider and Internet Police.
