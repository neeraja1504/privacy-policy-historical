An IP address is often associated with the portal through which you enter the Internet, like your ISP (Internet Service Provider), your company, or your university. Standing alone, your IP address is not personally identifiable. Your IP address allows us to track the pages you've visited. We aggregate this data with data from the pages visited by other users to track overall visitor traffic patterns.
