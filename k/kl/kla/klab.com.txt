4. Disclosure of Information Within the Services
As a user with an account, you may create your own profile, connect with other users of Services, send messages and transmit information through various channels.

6. Cookies, Web Beacons and Other Technologies
6.1 A "cookie" is a data file that is transferred to a user's computer and is intended to identify that computer. Cookies are used to maintain information about a user's visit to an application, website or game, such as user names, passwords and individual preferences. The Services may send cookies to your computer when you access the Services. Information contained in a cookie may be linked to your Personal Information. That information may be used for a variety of purposes including improving the quality and ease of use of the Services, managing and sending advertising, studying traffic patterns, and understanding the effectiveness of marketing communications.
6.2 The Services may also collect information using "web beacons," “pixel tags, "gifs" or similar means (collectively, “Pixel Tags”) in connection with our Services and to collect usage, demographic, geographical location or other data. A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel not visible to the user, and may be associated with cookies on a user’s hard drive. Pixel Tags allow, for example, the counting of users, the delivery of branded services, and the gathering of data to assess the effectiveness of promotional campaigns.
6.3 The Services may include third party advertisements. These ads may be served by third party advertising companies that deliver cookies to your computer, allowing these companies to track the ads. These companies will consequently be able to recognize your computer when they send you an advertisement. These advertisers may use information about your visits to the Services in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you.
6.4 You have the option to disable cookies by changing the options in your browser to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the pages you visit. Please note, however, that “flash” cookies operate differently from browser cookies and cookie management tools available in a web browser may not remove “flash” cookies. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to view or use all portions of the Services due to limited functionality.
7. Security of Your Information
7.1 It is important that you protect and maintain the security of your account and that you immediately notify KLab of any unauthorized use of your account. If you forget the password to your KLab account, the Services allows you to request that instructions be sent to you that explain how to reset your password. When you sign into your account or enter payment information (such as a credit card number), KLab encrypts the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology ("SSL").
7.2 KLab takes commercially reasonable precautions against possible security breaches of our Services and customer records but no website or internet transmission is completely secure. KLab does not guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur. KLab urges you to take steps to keep your personal information safe (including your account password), and to log out of your account after use. In addition, if your SNS account is hacked, it may lead to unauthorized use of Services you have procured so be careful to keep your account information secure.
7.3 The transmission of information over the internet is not completely secure. KLab cannot guarantee the security of your data while it is being transmitted and any transmission is at your own risk.
8. Changing or Removing Information
8.1 You may request that your Personal Information be changed or deleted by following the process provided in the applicable Services and we will take all reasonable measures to promptly comply with such requests. If you delete all of your information, your account may become deactivated. You may opt-out of receiving promotional emails from us by following the instructions in those emails. If you opt-out, KLab may still send you non-promotional emails, such as emails about your accounts or your ongoing business relations with KLab.
8.2 You may also email KLab at privacy@klab.com. _ to request the deletion of your Personal Information from KLab’s database. KLab will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor your request. KLab may retain an archived copy of your records as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.
8.3 Specific Shared Data cannot be retrieved from Preferred Partners after its disclosure.
8.4 Where you share information with other users through the communication channels of the Services, you should generally not expect to have any ability to modify or remove such communications.
9. Links to Other Websites and Services
The Services may contain links to other websites and online services or offers from third parties, such as third party advertisers. If you choose to participate in offer-linked information requests or “click” an advertisement or other third party link, you may be directed to that third party’s website or service and/or be prompted to provide Personal Information. KLab is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites or services. If you have any questions about how these other websites or services use your information, you should review their policies and contact them directly.
10. International Transfer of Information
KLab may transfer information (including Personal Information) that is collected about you to KLab’s affiliates or to other third parties that may be outside of your country. If you are located in the European Union or any other country or jurisdiction, such locations may have laws governing data collection and use that are less strict or otherwise differ from the laws where the information may be transferred or used. Please note that, by accessing or using the Services, you are transferring information and allowing KLab or others to transfer information, including personal information, to a country that does not have the same data protection or privacy laws as your jurisdiction, and you consent to the transfer of information to countries outside of your jurisdiction and the use and disclosure of information about you, including Personal Information, as described in this Privacy Policy.
11. Policy Toward Children
The Services are not intended for children under the age of 13 and KLab does not knowingly collect any Personal Information from such children. If KLab discovers that it has inadvertently collected Personal Information from children, KLab will take all reasonable measures to erase such information from its systems and records as soon as possible.
12. Your California Privacy Rights
