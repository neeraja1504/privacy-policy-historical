**Klikot - Privacy Policy**
version  ( **1-9-2008** )
We respect your privacy. This policy explains the accepted privacy practices for Our online social network
at [www.Klikot.com](http://www.klikot.com/) ("Klikot"). It describes the personal information that We collect directly from you, the
information automatically logged when you use Klikot, the ways We retain, use and disclose the information,
and your rights with respect to such information. This policy is incorporated to the Klikot's

**_Personal information that We collect_**
We do not knowingly collect your personally identifiable information without your consent. When you register
with Klikot and set up your personal account, We will ask you to provide Us with certain contact and personal
details such as your name and e-mail address, in order to enable you to login to Klikot. Additionally, certain
Services on Klikot may require you to furnish Us with relevant information in order to complete the respective
Service. We will explicitly state the information We require on the relevant web pages. We may collect further
information when you use any of the Services on Klikot. For example, we may record the frequency and scope
of your use of the services, the duration of your sessions, the web pages that you visit, information that you
read, content that you use or create, advertisements that you view or click on, your communications with other
users and third parties on Klikot, the Internet protocol (IP) address and the name of the domain that serve you

to log-in on Klikot. We may automatically gather this information, through the use of log files. If you are registered
with Klikot, the information we gather may be anonymous or in some instances personally identifiable. If you are
not a registered user, than we will not knowingly make use of any information which personally identifies you,
except as specifically indicated in the policy. Further information may be collected when We exchange communications
with you, for example, if you submit a request to our customer support, or write to Kliker – your online friend on our
behalf or when you contact our designated Copyright Agent.
**_Personal information that you share_**
Klikot enables you to upload, distribute, e-mail, disseminate, transmit or otherwise make your content available
on Klikot, and to share it with other users. The content that you post, including text and images, may be accessible
to other users, according to the personal preferences that you set when you create your personal account, and may
appear in search results on Klikot. You must exercise caution and common sense when posting your content, especially
any personally identifiable information. At the very least you should demonstrate the same degree of caution as when
publishing your content by any means other than the internet.

elsewhere and to provide you with further marketing and advertising material, subject to your prior indication
of consent on Klikot. At any time you may opt out of Our mailing lists, by changing your preferences in your
Klikot personal account. In any case, We will not share your personal identifiable details with any advertisers,
without your explicit consent;
•   To post your content on Klikot and to facilitate communication between you and us, and between you and
other users;

and other users or third parties with respect to, or in relation with Klikot;
**_How do We use aggregated information?_**
We may use anonymous, statistical or aggregated information on Klikot, including posting, disseminating, transmitting
or otherwise communicating or making available such information through Klikot, or to users on Klikot, or to Our suppliers,
partners and any other third party, at Our sole discretion, provided however, that such information will not identify you
personally and that we will not knowingly, or intentionally use such information to reveal your identity without your consent,
under the terms of this Policy. We may also use anonymous, statistical or aggregated information to properly operate Klikot,
to improve the quality of the services, to enhance your experience, to create new services, including customized services, to
change or cancel existing content or Services and for further internal and statistical purposes.
**_Sharing information with others_**
We do not sell, rent or lease your personally identifiable information to third parties for any of their marketing purposes.
We may share personally identifiable information with others in any of the following instances, or subject to your
explicit consent:
•   When you use the Services, or when you take part in any content-related activity, or request for a third party's
service through Klikot, or when you use such service. In these cases, we will share your information only to the
extent required to facilitate your use of the Services;
•   If We reasonably believe that you have breached Klikot's Terms of Use, or abused your rights to use Klikot, or
performed any act or omission that we reasonably believe to be violating any applicable law, rules, or regulations.
We may share your information in these cases, with law enforcement and other competent authorities and with any
third party, as may be required to handle any result of your wrongdoing;
•   If We are required, or reasonably believe that we are required by law to share or disclose your information;

parties with respect to, or in relation with Klikot;
•   In any case where We may reasonably believe that sharing information is necessary to prevent imminent physical
damage or damage to property;
•   If We organize the operation of Klikot within a different framework, or through another legal structure or entity, or
if We are acquired by, or merged with another entity, provided however, that those entities agree to be bound by
the provisions of this policy, with respective changes taken into consideration;
•   We may also share personally identifiable information with companies or organizations connected, or affiliated
with Us, such as subsidiaries, sister-companies and parent companies, with the express provision that their
use of such information must comply with this Policy.
**_Accessing your personal information on Klikot_**
At any time you may access your account on Klikot and edit, or amend your personal information. If you find that the
information on your account is not accurate, complete or updated, than you must make all necessary changes to correct
it. Please keep in mind that false, incorrect, or out dated information may prevent you from registering with Klikot and
impair Our ability to provide you with Services and to contact you. You are entitled, no more than twice a year, whether
by yourself or through a duly authorized proxy, or a legal guardian, and at your own expense, to access your personally
identifiable information on Klikot's databases. If you find that the information is not accurate, complete or updated, then
you may request to correct, amend or delete such information. We may refuse to comply with your request for various
reasons, for example, if We think that deleting certain information might prevent Us from maintaining necessary contact
with you, or jeopardize certain activities on Klikot, or harm other users. In any case, We will inform you whether We
would comply or refuse to your request. Prior to accessing personal information on behalf of another person, We may
ask you to provide Us with a written and duly signed power of attorney, specifically confirming that you are authorized
by the personal information's subject, or the subject's legal guardian, to access the information and edit, or amend it.
You agree that We may deny you access, if you fail to provide Us with the necessary power of attorney.
**_Data retention_**
We reserve the right at all times to review, retain and/or disclose any information as We deem necessary to satisfy
any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request. However, by doing so We do not either expressly
or impliedly endorse, affirm or in any manner assume any responsibility for such communications.
**_Cookies_**
We may use cookies on Klikot. Cookies are packets of information sent by Our servers to your web browser and
then sent back by the browser each time it accesses Our servers. The cookies may contain a variety of information,
such as the content of search queries, Klikot's pages you have accessed, session durations and IP addresses.
We may use cookies for various purposes, such as to save you the need to re-enter your user name and password each
time you login on Klikot, to facilitate the use of Services on Klikot, to collect statistical information with respect to the use
of Klikot, to verify information, to customize Services on Klikot to your personal preferences and for information security
purposes. Some of the Cookies may expire when the session ends and you exit your browser. Other cookies are saved
on your computer’s hard drive. If you wish to block our cookies, then please use the help button in your browser and
follow the necessary instructions. However, bear in mind that disabling cookies may complicate or even prevent your
use of Klikot, or certain features thereof.
**_Advertising campaigns_**
We may permit certain other companies to conduct advertising campaigns on Klikot. The advertisements that you see
when accessing Klikot are redirected from the servers of those advertising companies. Some advertisers may use cookies
on your computer. The cookies enable them to collect information about websites that you have accessed, advertisements
posted on those sites and the advertisements that you have viewed. In this manner advertisers try to customize advertisements
to your preferences. The advertisers' use of cookies is subject to their own privacy policies and not to this Policy. If you
wish to study the privacy policies of those advertisers you should visit their websites, or contact them directly.
**_Information Security_**
We implement systems, applications and procedures to secure your personal information, to minimize the risks of theft,
damage, loss of information, or unauthorized access or use of information. However, these measures are unable to provide
absolute assurance. Therefore, although We take great efforts to protect your privacy, We do not guarantee and you cannot
reasonably expect that Klikot and Our databases will be immune from any wrongdoings, malfunctions, unlawful interceptions
or access, or other kinds of abuse and misuse, or that your private communications on or through Klikot will remain private.
**_Changes to this Privacy Policy_**
We may change and update the terms of this Policy from time to time. We therefore recommend that you read it periodically.
All substantial changes that We make to this Policy will be notified on Klikot and take effect 30 days following their initial posting.
