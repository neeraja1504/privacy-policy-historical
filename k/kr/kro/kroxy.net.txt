5. Disclosure of your information
We will share your personal data with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy. We do not sell or rent your personal data to third parties. As described in the introduction to this Privacy Policy, Privax is part of the Avast Group, and we may disclose your data subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy to any member of the Avast Group. While some members of the Avast Group have separate privacy policies, to the extent these privacy policies differ, we will ensure that any personal data collected pursuant to this Privacy Policy and shared with another member of the Avast Group is treated according to terms at least as strict as this Privacy Policy. Please note that the Avast Group is comprised of companies and offices around the world. In order to do business around the globe, we may share your personal data across our offices and companies which may be in countries with different laws regarding the collection and use of personal data than the country we collected it from. Lastly, we may share your personal data:
when necessary to deliver the product or service you require such as with a payment card provider who we use to process your credit card transaction;
when authorized by law or necessary to comply with a valid legal process;
when required to protect and defend the rights or property of the Avast Group, including the security of our products and services;
when necessary to protect the personal safety, property or other rights of the public, the Avast Group or its customers or employees; or
in connection with a sale of all or part of our business.
If we receive a report from any person or organisation (including law enforcement) that leads us to suspect that your account has been used in connection with any wrong-doing, we may at our discretion suspend your account, but we will not disclose any personal information that may identify you unless we are legally compelled to do so. If we are involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, we will abide by this Privacy Policy with respect to any data collected by Privax, and any affected users will be informed if we transfer any personal data to a third party or if personal data becomes subject to a different privacy policy as a result.
6. Your Rights with Respect to your Data; Emails
The UK Data Protection Act 1998 gives you the right to access information held about you. Your right of access can be exercised in accordance with the Data Protection Act. You have the right to ask us about the personal data we process about you, the purpose and nature of the processing, and to provide information on who we share it with. You have the right to request that we update, correct, or delete (assuming that this does not impact the services we are providing to you) your personal data at any time by emailing us at info@hidemyass.com. Please note that we may reject requests which risk the privacy of others or are unreasonable or repetitive, or would require disproportionate effort. Unless you request us to delete your data, please note that we may keep your personal data for one year after you stop being a customer (but we typically keep your personal data no longer than is reasonably necessary given the purposes for which the data was collected). You have the right to opt-out of receiving certain emails at any time by following the relevant unsubscribe process outlined in the applicable email. Please be aware that our emails may include important or useful information about our services, and you may not be able to unsubscribe from certain transactional emails.

Periodically, our site or products may contain links to and from websites or other external destinations managed by third parties. If you follow a link to any of these destinations (like offers on mobile app stores etc.), please note that those sites have their own privacy policy. When you are on those sites you are subject to those policies, and should therefore read and understand them before you submit any personal data to those sites.
Certain other Avast Group companies may have different privacy policies, that govern information collected using those sites or from the applications those companies provide. We invite you to read those privacy policies before deciding to use those sites and products. This Privacy Policy will control with regard to information you provide us or we collect in connection with the use of the Privax services, regardless of which Avast Group Company is holding such information.

Do Not Track (or DNT) is a preference you can set in your browser to let websites you visit know that you do not want websites to collect certain information about you. Privax does not support the Do Not Track browser setting. Privax does not track visitors to the Sites and therefore does not respond to DNT signals.
