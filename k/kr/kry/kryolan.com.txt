If you choose to link or login to your Kryolan account with or through a social networking service, Kryolan and that service may share certain information about you and your activities, including your IP Address and that you have visited our Website. With your consent, we also may share information about your activities, including what you view on the Website, with that social network’s users.
Non-Personal Information.
When you interact with our Website, our servers may keep an activity log or our servers may automatically store Non-Personal Information that does not identify you individually. Generally, we collect and store the following categories of Non-Personal Information:
Demographic data, such as age, gender, and your five-digit zip code, as part of collecting Personal Information;
Device information about your computer, mobile device, tablet or other technology (each a “Device”) that you use to access the Website. This information may include browser type, browser language, and other transaction information;
Usage information about your use of the Website, such as a reading history of the pages you view. We use this information to provide you a more customized experience of the Website;
Additional “traffic data” such as time of access, date of access, software crash reports, session identification number, access times, and referring website addresses;
Your search terms and search results; and
Other information regarding your use of the Website.
Collection of Your Source IP Address / Location Information
We may collect and store your Device’s source IP address, which may disclose the location of your Device at the time you access the Website. Advertisements and certain content may be directed to you as a result of this data. In addition, in some cases the Website can deliver content based on your current location if you choose to enable that feature. If you enable that feature, your current location will be stored to serve you certain content tied to your location. If you elect to have your location-based searches saved to your history, we will store such information on our servers.
Collection of Personal and Non-Personal Information from Other Sources
We also may collect and store information about you that we receive from other sources (including our offline interactions with you), to, among other things, enable us to update and correct the information contained in our database and to better customize your experience on the Website.
Cookies and Spyware
Like many websites, we may use “Cookies” , which are small text files that are stored on your Device when you visit certain online pages that record your preferences and actions. We use Cookies to track use of our Website and online services. We may also use Cookies to monitor traffic, improve the Website and make it easier or more relevant for your use.
Specifically, our Website uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google Inc. ( “Google” ). Google Analytics uses Cookies, which collect information about your use of the Website (including your IP address), which is sent to a server of Google in the United States and stored there. Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the Website, to prepare reports on the Website activities for us, and to perform additional services involving use of the Website and the Internet. Google will provide this information to third parties, insofar as such is legally stipulated. Google may not connect your IP address with other data by Google. By using our Website, you declare that you agree to the processing of data obtained about you by Google in the manner described above, and for the purpose as stated. You have the ability to accept or decline Cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept Cookies, but, if you prefer, you can usually modify your browser setting to decline Cookies. If you delete your Cookies or if you set your web browser to decline Cookies, some features of the Website may not work or may not work as designed. For more information on Cookies and how to disable them, you can consult the information provided by the Interactive Advertising Bureau at www.allaboutcookies.org. We may also use web beacons or flash cookies. A web beacon or flash cookie (also known as “action tags”, “tracer tags”, or “single-pixel gifs”) is an invisible graphic on a web page that is programmed to collect Non-Personal Information about your use of a given website. We do not share or provide Personal Information we may collect through such web beacons, such as names, e-mail addresses and phone numbers without your express permission. We may also use “Web Storage” to store data about your use of our Website. Web Storage is a feature in some browsers that permits websites to store data within your browser rather than within a Cookie. This should make this data more secure and make your browser perform better. We do not share or provide Personal Information we may store in Web Storage, such as names and e-mail addresses, without your express permission.

Security of Personal Information
Personal data provided within the context of an order or as part of our other service offerings are protected by technical security systems and additional authorization procedures. While we use reasonable efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your information, we are not liable for disclosure of any information due to errors in transmission or the unauthorized acts of third parties.

If Kryolan learns of a security breach, we may attempt to notify you so that you can take appropriate protective steps.
Your Obligation to Keep Access Rights Secure
You promise to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the Website’s registration form (such information being the “Registration Data” ) and (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete.

6. Data Transfers
We may transfer the Personal Information we collect to countries other than the country in which you are located. Those countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the information, and by voluntarily submitting Personal Information to us, you thereby consent to the transfer of that information to, and / or storage of that information in, the United States.
7. Assignment
Kryolan may change its ownership or corporate organization while providing the Website. As a result, please be aware that Kryolan may transfer your information to another company that is affiliated with Kryolan or with which Kryolan has merged or been acquired by.
