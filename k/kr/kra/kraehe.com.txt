The data collection and storage can be contradicted at any time with effect for the future: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de . In view of the discussion about the use of analysis tools with complete IP addresses, we would like to point out that this website uses Google Analytics with the extension "_anonymizeIP ()" and therefore IP addresses are only shortened processed in order to exclude a direct personal reference.

For this purpose, cookies can be used to enable the recognition of an Internet browser. However, user profiles are not merged with data about the bearer of the pseudonym without the visitor's explicit consent. In particular, IP addresses are rendered unrecognizable immediately after receipt, so that an assignment of usage profiles to IP addresses is not possible. Visitors to this website may object to this data collection and storage at any time for the future here: https://www.econda.de/en/data-storage-opt-out/ . The contradiction only applies to the device and the web browser on which it was set, please repeat the process on all devices if necessary.

This website uses the Google Inc. remarketing feature (1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA; "Google"). This feature is designed to show interest-based ads to visitors to the site through the Google Network. The website visitor's browser stores so-called "cookies", text files that are stored on your computer and that allow visitors to be recognized when they visit the website that belongs to the Google ad network. On these pages, visitors can then be presented with ads related to content the visitor previously visited on the website using Google's remarketing feature. Google says it does not collect any personal information during this process. However, if you still do not want Google's Remarketing feature, you can always disable it by making the appropriate settings at http://www.google.com/settings/ads. For more information about Google Remarketing and the Google Privacy Policy, please visit: http://www.google.com/privacy/ads/. We use the Google AdWords online advertising program and conversion tracking as part of Google AdWords. Google Conversion Tracking is an analytics service provided by Google Inc. (1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA; "Google"). When you click on an ad served by Google, a conversion tracking cookie will be placed on your machine. These cookies lose their validity after 30 days, contain no personal data and are thus not used for personal identification. If you visit certain web pages on our website and the cookie has not expired, Google and we may recognize that you clicked on the ad and were redirected to this page. Each Google AdWords customer receives a different cookie. Thus, there is no way that cookies can be tracked through the AdWordsKundener website. The information obtained using the conversion cookie is used to generate conversion statistics for AdWords advertisers who have opted for conversion tracking. It tells customers the total number of users who clicked on their ad and were redirected to a conversion tracking tag page. However, they do not receive information that personally identifies users. If you do not want to participate in the tracking, you can object to this use by preventing the installation of cookies by a corresponding setting of your browser software (deactivation option). You will not be included in the conversion tracking statistics.
