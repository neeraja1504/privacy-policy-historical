However, this Privacy Policy is subordinate to any specific terms and conditions set forth in any terms of use, end user license agreements, or other agreements with Kreg Tool related to a particular product, service, or data that is collected.

What Types of Information and Data Does Kreg Tool Collect, and When Does It Collect This Data?
Kreg Tool collects various types of Personal Information. We collect this information when you provide it to us (whether directly or through our dealers and/or representatives) or when you use certain services provided by Kreg Tool.
"Personal Information" is information that can be used to identify, locate, or contact you as a natural person, as well as other information about you that we tie to Personal Information. Personal Information that we collect includes, but is not limited to, the following types of information:
"Contact Information" that allows us to identify and communicate with you, such as your name, phone number, address, email, and language preferences.

"Transactional Information" about how you interact with us, our dealers and business partners, including purchases, services you request, customer service inquiries, and customer account information.
"Financial Account Information" as needed to complete your purchases, such as credit card information and information about financing and leasing activities.
“Non-Personal Information” is any information that does not does not identify a natural person and is not identifiable to a natural person, such as:
Cookies and other tools used in a non-identifiable way;
Anonymized information;
Aggregated information; and
Information about your business operations, including, but not limited to:
Operation-specific data, such as location data, when kept in a non-identifiable way; and
The name, form, and contact details of legal persons.
In addition to the methods described above, Personal Information and Non-Personal Information may be collected by Kreg Tool from its authorized dealers and distributors as part of its standard business operations, to provide services to the authorized dealers and distributors, and as otherwise agreed pursuant to agreements between Kreg Tool and such authorized dealers and distributors.
When data is described as “anonymized,” it means that the data is no longer associated with a particular person.  When data is described as “aggregated,” it means that such information has been combined with other data in such a way that no person can be identified or linked to any specific action or information.
How Kreg Tool Uses Your Information (the "Purposes")
Subject to the limitations and other rights set forth in this Privacy Policy, Kreg Tool uses your Personal Information in its identifiable form for a variety of purposes, including:
To Complete Orders and Provide Requested Services. To fulfill orders for products or services, and for other services or purposes as you may request or direct, such as product delivery, maintenance, warranty service, financing, leasing, or credit services.
Product and Customer Support. To provide support services, to deliver upgrades and product improvement communications, and for repairs, product safety, and recalls.
Marketing and Surveys. To communicate offers for products, building content, and services from Kreg Tool or its dealers, suppliers, or partners, including offers based on your demographics and psychographics, interests, personal and business characteristics and your location; to administer surveys, polls, sweepstakes, contest, loyalty programs and other promotional events; and to provide other information which may be of interest to you, such as Kreg Tool company news, catalogs, announcements, reminders, and technical bulletins. Please contact us if you would not like to be contacted by Kreg Tool for marketing purposes without being asked.  We will provide you with the opportunity to opt-out of marketing information or market research inquiries.

As Disclosed at the Time of Collection. In any other manner that we may describe when you provide the information to us.
These Purposes may be necessary for Kreg Tool to perform a contract to which you are a party, comply with a legal obligation to which Kreg Tool is subject, protect Kreg Tool’s vital interests or the interests of another natural person, or otherwise pursue Kreg Tool’s legitimate business purposes and objectives.  Kreg Tool may obtain your consent to process your Personal Information, as necessary.
Kreg Tool collects Non-Personal Information in the same ways it collects Personal Information, described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.
Because Non-Personal Information does not personally identify you, Kreg Tool may use and disclose Non-Personal Information for any purpose. In some instances, Kreg Tool may combine Non-Personal Information with Personal Information (such as combining your name with your location data). If Kreg Tool combines any Non-Personal Information with Personal Information, Kreg Tool will treat the combined information as Personal Information.
In addition, Kreg Tool reserves the right to use anonymized and aggregated Personal Information to improve its products and services, to create and publish reports, to conduct statistical analysis about our customers and products, and for other activities that do not result in the disclosure of your identifiable information.
When Will Kreg Tool Disclose Your Information, and Who May Receive It?
Kreg Tool is committed to being transparent regarding the manner in which we use and disclose your information. We may disclose and share your information as follows:
We may share Personal Information with our affiliated companies, our suppliers, authorized dealers and distributors, and business partners, as needed to accomplish, and consistently with, the Purposes set forth above, or as you authorize or request.
We may also share Personal Information with our service providers to fulfill the Purposes on our behalf. Our service providers are bound by law or contract to treat your information and data with the same level of protection that we do and to only use it in accordance with our instructions.
We may disclose Personal Information where needed to affect the sale or transfer of business assets, to enforce our rights, protect our property, or protect the rights, property, or safety of others, or as needed to support external auditing, compliance, and corporate governance functions.
We will also disclose Personal Information when required to do so by law, such as in response to a subpoena, including to law enforcement agencies and courts in the countries where we operate.
As noted above, Kreg Tool reserves the right to use and disclose anonymized and aggregated Personal Information to improve its products and services, to create and publish reports, to conduct statistical analysis about our customers and products, and for other activities that do not result in the disclosure of your identifiable information.
**How Long Will Kreg Tool Keep your Information?   **
