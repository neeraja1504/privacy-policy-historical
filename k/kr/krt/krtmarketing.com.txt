OUR COMMITMENT TO USER PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION
We don’t sell, rent or make public your private information. If we are co-hosting events with other companies and information will be shared, this will be clearly informed upon data collection.
WHAT DATA WE COLLECT AND WHY
TRACKING OF WEBSITE VISITS
How
The Websites listed above use Google Analytics (GA) to track user engagement. GA automatically records geographical location, device type, internet browser and operating system (OS), but none of this information personally identifies you. GA also records your computer’s IP address which could personally identify you, but we do not have access to that information.
Please check Google’s developer guides to learn more about how GA uses cookies.
The KRT Marketing Websites also use the following track codes:
HubSpot tracks visitors by using browser cookies. Visitors will be tracked anonymously before they pro-actively provide their personal information through one of our lead generation forms.
LinkedIn and Facebook track visitors anonymously. This means that third parties, including Facebook, may use cookies, web beacons and other storage technologies to collect and/or receive information from our website and elsewhere on the internet, and use that information to provide measurement services and target ads.
We consider LinkedIn, Facebook, Google and HubSpot to be third-party data processors.
Why
The purpose for collecting website visits data is to measure website traffic and better understand how visitors are interacting with its pages so we can improve user experience and the content we offer.
When it comes to LinkedIn and Facebook tracking, cookies are also used to show personalized and relevant advertising while visitors are not on our website – including remarketing.
Controlling Cookies
Disabling cookies on your internet browser will prevent engagement tracking on the above-mentioned websites. You can learn how to manage cookies here. You can opt-out of targeted advertising from networks KRT Marketing may work with by setting your preferences here: http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/; if you are within the European Union, you may visit: http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/

INBOUND DATA COLLECTION
Some information on our website is gated – which means it requires visitors to provide their personal data (typically name, company and email address – but not limited to this information) in order to access resources on our websites. If you choose to provide us with your information, your data will not be stored by a website database or a local computer – it will automatically be forwarded and stored by HubSpot (serves as CRM and inbound marketing automation platform) and/or MailChimp (serves as email marketing platform) and/or JotForm (serves as form creation and submission software).
KRT Marketing will have access to your information in HubSpot, MailChimp and JotForm. We may use these platforms to send you regular recruitment marketing communications. All the information (data) submitted by you will be stored in HubSpot’s database for the duration of our contract with HubSpot, or until you actively request removal from the database. The information in MailChimp and JotForm will be stored in the respective databases for a maximum of three (3) years.
