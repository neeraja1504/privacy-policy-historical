Information Collection: Personally & Publicly Identifiable Information
In the course of using the Services, we ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you and administer your account ("Personally Identifiable Information"). Personally Identifiable Information may include, but is not limited to, your name, phone number, credit card or other billing information, email address and postal addresses.
Fliptop collects contact information that is publically accessible (e.g. information that is available to search engines)("Publicly Identifiable Information"). Publicly Identifiable Information (e.g. a social network profile that is not set to 'private' or information on a social network page that can be seen to users who are not logged in), is searched and sometimes indexed by Fliptop, just like major Internet search engines. Fliptop recommends that if you do not want to be searched or indexed by search engines or services like Fliptop, that you set the appropriate privacy controls within social networks and 3rd party applications like Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. You can learn how to do this by visiting these sites directly.
Fliptop Social Contacts Application
The Fliptop Social Contacts Application allows Clients to dynamically populate their contacts with social media ids. To enable this application, we will download the contact information for each user's contacts and leads, and use this information to determine social id matches for each contact. We will give users the ability to review these matches and choose the most likely correct match. Fliptop will then store match information for use within the Service.
Clients access the Fliptop Service via API or SFTP. More information is available at developer.fliptop.com. As you use the Services, our servers automatically record information that the browser sends whenever it points to a website or online service ("Log Data"). Log Data may include, but is not limited to, your computer's Internet Protocol address, browser type, the web page you were visiting before you came to one of the Sites and information you search for on Sites.
Fliptop collects information under the direction of its Clients when providing our Services, and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes.
Like many websites, we use "cookies" to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use "persistent cookies" to save your username and login password for future logins to the Sites. We use "session ID cookies" to enable certain features of the Services, to better understand how you interact with the Services and to monitor web traffic routing on the Sites and aggregate usage of the Services. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Sites or all functionality of the Services. Our cookies are tied to personally identifiable information.
Our Policy Toward Children
Fliptop does not knowingly collect Personally Identifiable Information from children under 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personally Identifiable Information without their consent, he or she should contact us at privacy [at] fliptop [dot] com.
