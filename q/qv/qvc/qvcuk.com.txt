Although we are required to be compliant with the GDPR’s general legal framework, we also rely on consent under the ePrivacy Directive to the extent we are required to do so, and when we refer to "ePrivacy Consent" below, it is on this basis but without prejudice to the performance of some of our data processing activities on the basis of our legitimate interest, where possible.

Customer segmentation
To give you the best possible customer experience, we need to get a good picture of who you are.  To help us to do that, we run a customer segmentation programme, using a third party service provider who allocates customers to certain categories or segments based on, for example, their age, address, gender and order data (i.e., what they have purchased).  Our service provider then enriches that information with so-called lifestyle data.  These are just statistics-based assumptions, for example on your probable life situation (eg single household), your shopping habits, your media usage (eg "online", "TV", "magazines", "social networks") and your location.  Based on the overall information, we assign you to a specific customer segment, and we then delete the lifestyle data.  The segment you are in becomes part of your customer record.  This allows us to offer you promotions, products and services that are most likely to interest you. Customer segmentation and data processing are done under a legitimate interest basis meant to enrich your experience so that you only receive advertising that is tailored to your individual needs, while serving QVC’s interest in engaging its customers.
Who can see my personal information?
We grant individuals who help QVC provide the Services access to your personal information, as necessary to perform the tasks required.  These people may work for third party service providers.  These third party service providers are required to agree to safeguard your personal information appropriately and according to law. QVC may also share your personal information with certain "Affiliates" in their capacity as the direct and indirect owners of QVC. These owners include Qurate Retail, Inc. and its direct and indirect owners. QVC may also share your personal information with certain other Affiliates as necessary to perform the tasks required, and these Affiliates include QVC, Inc., HSN, Inc., zulily llc, and the other companies that are directly or indirectly owned by Qurate Retail, Inc.
We also share personal information about you with others for additional purposes, including:
As required or permitted by applicable law, for compliance with a legal obligation; establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims, or if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary;

Data Transfers outside of the EEA
QVC's Affiliates and third party service providers who have access to personal data may be located in other countries, and these countries may not have an adequacy decision by the European Commission.
