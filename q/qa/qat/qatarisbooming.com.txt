9. Cookies Policy – Information ME Business Wire collects from you
a. What is a cookie?
A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes a unique identifier that is sent to your computer or mobile phone (referred to here as a “device”) browser from a website’s computer and is stored on your device’s hard drive. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser’s preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other websites. Many websites do this whenever a user visits their website in order to track online traffic flows.
On qatarisbooming.com, cookies record information about your online preferences and allow us to tailor the websites to your interests. Users have the opportunity to set their devices to accept all cookies, to notify them when a cookie is issued, or not to receive cookies at any time. The last of these means that certain personalised features cannot then be provided to that user and accordingly they may not be able to take full advantage of all of the website’s features. Each browser is different, so check the “Help” menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.
During the course of any visit to qatarisbooming.com, the pages you see, along with a cookie, are downloaded to your device. Many websites do this, because cookies enable website publishers to do useful things like find out whether the device (and probably its user) has visited the website before. This is done on a repeat visit by checking to see, and finding, the cookie left there on the last visit.
b. How does qatarisbooming.com use cookies?
Information supplied by cookies can help us to analyse the profile of our visitors and help us to provide you with a better user experience. For example, if on a previous visit you went to our sports pages, we might find this out from your cookie and highlight sports information on your second and subsequent visits.
ME Business Wire also use a number of independent measurement and research companies. They gather information regarding the visitors to qatarisbooming.com on our behalf using cookies, log file data and code which is embedded on our website. ME Business Wire use this type of information to help improve the services it provides to its users. All third parties are strictly required not to use any information for their own business or other purposes (see paragraph 5 above).
c. Third Party Cookies on qatarisbooming.com pages
Please note that during your visits to qatarisbooming.com you may notice some cookies that are not related to ME Business Wire. When you visit a page with content embedded from, for example, YouTube or Flickr, you may be presented with cookies from these websites. ME Business Wire does not control the dissemination of these cookies. You should check the third party websites for more information about these.
