Use of cookies
What are cookies?
Cookies are small text files that are temporarily stored on the hard disk of your device. Qantara.de uses cookies for technical reasons without pointing this out in detail on each occasion. We save your IP address during the use of cookies.
Cookies do not store any personal data, and are used to collect anonymous data and statistics on the use of the website by visitors. Cookies help us measure how well our websites are performing. This data helps us to improve and customise our content so you get more out of your visit to Qantara.de.
Which cookies does Qantara.de use?
Session cookies
These cookies only last for the duration of a session. They will disappear from your computer when you close the browser or turn your computer off. If you have chosen to identify yourself on Qantara.de, we will also use session cookies that contain encrypted information to identify you.
Persistent cookies
These cookies remain on your computer even after you close the browser or turn off the device. They are activated each time a user visits the website that created that particular cookie. To this end, you are assigned a unique identifier. This unique identifier is part of a persistent cookie that we leave on your browser. This serves various purposes such as, for example, saving your preferred Qantara.de language.
If you do not want us to remember your computer, you can disable the storage of cookies in the browser that you are using or turn on notification for when cookies are sent.
Qantara.de can also be used without cookies.

Measurement and analysis tools (in development)
We employ usage data for statistical purposes and analyses to help us to constantly improve and develop our online content. We do not aggregate the collected data with other data sources. The data is used for internal purposes only and not disclosed to third parties.
The apps that are currently distributed by Qantara.de are designed to serve the purpose of data economy. For statistical evaluation purposes, we collect information on when and how often the apps are started, used, closed and updated. This information is analysed as individual pieces of data and not linked to any other data. No personal data is used during the data analysis process. For evaluation purposes, the IP addresses of devices that use Qantara.de apps will be logged; however, this happens anonymously. This anonymisation process is outsourced to a specialised service provider.
On principle, Qantara.de does not collect any data on location or device identification number (UDID). If personal data is to be collected and used within the framework of a Qantara.de app, this app will contain a separate declaration and information on data protection.
Qantara.de has no influence, however, on which data is collected and stored by network providers and operating system manufacturers when using its apps and how such data used.
Which tools we use and how they work:
Facebook Pixel
We use Facebook pixel to target people who visit Qantara.de's website more directly. As is common in this industry, we use Facebook Pixel to improve our advertisements and to provide people with more relevant ads.
Facebook pixel is a short piece of JavaScript code that is inserted into the HTML code of a web page. When a web page is loaded, Facebook pixel sends general information about the browser session to Facebook. If possible, a secure HTTP connection is used here. No personal data about the visitor to the website is transmitted.
For more information on Facebook Data Policy and Settings
AT Internet
This service is used on all Qantara.de products as an analysis tool to improve our online content. Using AT Internet, we collect data on the number of page views and visits, on user behaviour and the length of time users spend on our online content. This data is gathered anonymously so no personal data is collected. We do not aggregate the collected data with other data sources.
If you do not agree to the tracking of your visit and want to prevent the collection of data by AT Internet, you can switch this off by referring to the opt-out procedure of the service provider.
Internet services and social media integration (currently in development)
Qantara.de continues to constantly test new services to support Internet-friendly ways of content distribution, including curating services such as ScribbleLive. We embed our content within social networks such as Facebook, Google Plus, Soundcloud, Twitter and YouTube.
For example, we embed content from providers such as YouTube, which is stored on their servers, on our websites. If you open a link to such a website that features outside content, this provider will receive the IP address of the device you use to go online. This external provider cannot draw any conclusions about your personal data from this IP address alone, but can infer, for example, where you are located geographically. Furthermore, this provider can program cookies on your device, with which they can log your online behavior.
Other examples are the embedded social network recommendation buttons (also called "social plugins") in our content.
