Collection of information
Information is collected primarily to make it easier and more rewarding for you to use our services.
IDC Networks, Inc [IDC] mostly collects anonymous information through QuickYellow and other websites it operates.

If you you are asked to provide your name, email address and other information and you provide your personal information, you are not anonymous to IDC.
Use of anonymous information
IDC automatically gathers anonymous information to monitor the use of our platform like the numbers and frequency of visitors to IDC sites and its areas, very much like television ratings that tell the networks how many people tuned in to a program. We only use such data in an aggregate way. This collective data helps us determine how much our audiences use parts of the site, so we can improve our services. IDC may publish or provide this aggregate data to other people.
