We use cookies and similar technologies on our website:
cookies that are required for our website to operate normally (these do contain personally identifiable information);
anonymous tracking cookies used to determine what users do on our website e.g. Google Analytics (these do not by themselves contain personally identifiable information);
third party cookies e.g. cookies used for tracking site usage from a third- party platform (such as Facebook) and/or for re-marketing. Users are asked to consent to this type of cookie monitoring and this consent may be withdrawn at any time.
What Do we do with your Data?
We use data collected by us, directly and indirectly, as may be necessary to operate our ticketing platform and in order to provide ticketing services, or data collected by us with the user’s consent. Data is also used to ensure our website functions properly, and in order to optimise and improve our service offering.
Event information submitted by Organisers will be publicly available on the website. Organisers are responsible for the information submitted by them and acknowledge that this information will be displayed publicly.
We will share Buyers’ names, contact and ticket information, with the relevant Organisers pursuant to a ticket purchase only insofar as is necessary so that Organisers can monitor who is attending an event. Organisers are not bound to treat data in accordance with this privacy policy. Users agree that Quicket is not responsible for the actions of these Organisers with respect to your data. It is important that you review the applicable policies of the Organisers of an event before providing personal data or other information in connection with that event.
We may contact users directly or through a third-party service provider regarding products or services a user has signed up for or purchased from us, such as may be necessary to deliver transactional or service related communications. Quicket may also contact you with offers for additional services we think you'll find valuable if you give us consent, or where allowed based upon legitimate interests.
We may share personal data with trusted third parties as necessary for them to perform services on our behalf, such as processing credit card payments. We only share personal data as necessary for any third party to provide the services as requested or as needed on our behalf. These third parties (and any subcontractors) are subject to strict data processing terms and conditions and are prohibited from utilising, sharing or retaining your personal data for any other purpose than as they have been specifically contracted for (or without your consent). We will share transaction data with our payment service providers or bank only to the extent necessary for the purposes of processing payments, refunding payments, transferring money to a user, and/or dealing with user queries and complaints relating to such payments, refunds and transfers.

We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process, to protect our property and rights or the property and rights of a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we consider to be illegal or unethical.
