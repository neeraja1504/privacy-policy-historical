You may choose to voluntarily submit other information to us through the Service that we do not request, and, in such instances, you are solely responsible for such information.
**Information Collected Automatically
We automatically collect information about your device and how your device interacts with our Websites. We may use Service Providers to collect this information.  Such information may include:
Service Use Data From Your Activity. In an ongoing effort to improve the Website, we automatically collect certain information when Visitors and Registered Users access and use the Website. Such information includes, without limitation, referring and exit pages and URLs, date and time, amount of time spent on particular pages, what sections of the Website users visit, log files, and similar information and data.
Device Connectivity and Configuration Data. We collect data about the type of device, the browser type and language you use, your device’s operating software, your internet service provider, and other similar information.  This data also includes IP address, MAC address, device advertising ID (e.g., IDFA or AAID), and other device identifiers.
Location Data. We collect data about your device’s location, which can be precise (e.g., latitude/longitude data) or imprecise (e.g., location derived from an IP address or data that indicates a city or postal code level).
We use various current – and later – developed technologies to collect this information (“Tracking Technologies”), including the following:
****We collect information using “cookie” technology. Cookies are small packets of data that a website stores on your computer’s hard drive so that your computer will “remember” information about your visit. We use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to help us collect information and to enhance your experience using the Website. If you do not want us to place a cookie on your hard drive, you may be able to turn that feature off on your computer. Please consult your Internet browser’s documentation for information on how to do this and how to delete persistent cookies. However, if you decide not to accept cookies from us, the Website may not function properly.
****A pixel (also known as a web beacon) is code embedded in a website, video, e-mail, or advertisements that sends information about your use to a server. There are various types of pixels, including image pixels (which are small graphic images) and JavaScript pixels (which contains JavaScript code). When you access a website, video, e-mail, or advertisement that contains a pixel, the pixel may permit us or a third party to drop or read cookies on your browser. Pixels are used in combination with cookies to track activity by a particular browser on a particular device. We incorporate pixels from third parties that allow us track our conversions, bring you advertising both on and off the Website, and provide you with additional functionality, such as the ability to connect our Website with your social media account.
Log Files. A log file is a file that records events that occur in connection with your use of the Website, such as your service use data.
Some information about your use of the Website and certain Third Party Services (defined below) may be collected using Tracking Technologies across time and services and used by us and third parties for purposes such as to associate different devices you use, and deliver relevant ads and/or other content to you on the Website and certain Third Party Services. For further information on Tracking Technologies and your rights and choices regarding them, see the sections entitled “Third Parties” and “Your Rights and Choices” below.
**Information from Other Sources.
We also obtain information about you from third-party advertising companies.  To the extent we combine such third party sourced information with information we have collected about you through the Website, we will treat the combined information in accordance with the practices described in this Privacy Policy, plus any additional restrictions imposed by the source of the data. These third party sources  vary over time, but have included:
Social networks when you reference our Service or grant permission to Company to access your data on one or more of these services.
Partners with which we offer co-branded services, sell or distribute our products, or engage in joint marketing activities.

Without limiting the foregoing, in our sole discretion, we may share aggregated information which does not identify you or de-identified information about you with third parties or affiliates for any purpose except as prohibited by applicable law. For information about your choices regarding how we share your information, please see the section below entitled “Your Rights and Choices.”

Third Parties
** Third Party Services.**
The Website contains content from and links to third-party websites, locations, platforms, and services operated and owned by third parties (“Third Party Services”).  These Third Party Services may use Tracking Technologies to independently collect information about you and may solicit information from you. The information collected and stored by third parties, whether through our Website, a Third Party Service, a Third Party Feature (defined below), or a third party device, remains subject to their own policies and practices, including what information they share with us, your rights and choices on their services and devices, and whether they store information in the U.S. or elsewhere. Quiet Revolution has no control over the privacy practices or the content of these Third Party Services. As such, we are not responsible for the content or the privacy policies of those Third Party Services. You should check the applicable third-party privacy policy and terms of use when visiting any other websites.
** Third Party Features.**
We may allow you to connect our Website to a Third Party Service or offer our Service through a Third Party Service (“Third Party Features”). If you use a Third Party Feature, both we and the applicable third party may have access to and use information associated with your use of the Third Party Feature, and you should carefully review the third party’s privacy policy and terms of use. Some examples of Third Party Features include the following:
Liking, Sharing, and Logging-In. We may embed a pixel or SDK on our Website that allows you to “like” or “share” content on, or log-in to your account through Third Party Services, including social networks such as Facebook and Twitter. If you choose to engage with such a Third Party Service through our Website, we may collect any information you have authorized the Third Party Service to share with us (such as your user ID, billing information, public profile information, e-mail address, birthday, friends list, and other account and profile data). Likewise, if you choose to engage with such a Third Party Service through our Website or visit our Website while logged in to that Third Party Service on your device, the Third Party Service may receive information about your activities on our Website and be able to associate that information with information the Third Party Service already has about you.
Brand Pages. We offer our content on social networks such as a Facebook and Twitter. Any information you provide to us when you engage with our content (such as through our brand page) is treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Also, if you publicly reference our Website on a Third Party Service (e.g., by using a hashtag associated with us in a tweet or post), we may use your reference on or in connection with our Website or services.
** Analytics and Interest-Based Advertising.**
Our Website contains Tracking Technologies owned and operated by Third Parties. For example, we use Tracking Technologies from third party analytics provides, such as Google Analytics, to help us analyze your use of the Website, compile statistic reports on the Website’s activity, and provide us with other services relating to Website activity and internet usage. We also work with ad serving services, advertisers, and other third parties to serve advertisements on the Service and/or on Third Party Services. You authorize us to share information about your activity on the Website with third parties for the purpose of tailoring, analyzing, managing, reporting, and optimizing advertising you see on the Website and elsewhere. These third parties may use Tracking Technologies on our Website and Third Party Services (including in e-mails and advertisements) to track your activities across time and services for purposes of associating the different devices you use, and delivering relevant ads and/or other content to you on the Website and Third Party Services or third party devices after you have left the Website (“Interest-based Advertising”).
We may serve ads on and through Third Party Services, such as Facebook and Google, that are targeted to reach people (or people similar to people) who have visited our Website or are identified in one or more of our databases (“Matched Ads”). This is done by us uploading a customer list to the Third Party Service or incorporating a pixel from the Third Party Service on our Website, and the Third Party Service matching common factors between our data and their data. To opt-out of receiving Matched Ads, please contact the applicable Third Party Service. If we use Facebook Custom Audiences to serve Matched Ads on Facebook services, you should be able to hover over the box in the right corner of such Facebook ads and find out how to opt-out. We are not responsible for such Third Party Service’s failure to comply with your opt-out instructions.

Cookies and Pixels. Most browsers accept cookies by default. You can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to decline or delete cookies. If you use multiple browsers on your device, you will need to instruct each browser separately. Your ability to limit cookies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.

Accordingly, we do not monitor or take action with respect to “Do Not Track” signals or other mechanisms.For more information on “Do Not Track,” visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com.
Please be aware that if you disable or remove Tracking Technologies some parts of the Service may not function correctly.

Some of the third parties that collect information from or about you on the Service in order to provide more relevant advertising to you participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance (“ DAA ”) Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. This program offers a centralized location where users can make choices about the use of their information for online behavioral advertising. To learn more about the DAA and your opt-out options for their members, please visit (i) for website opt-out, http://www.aboutads.info/choices; and (ii) for mobile app opt-out, http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices.In addition, some of these third parties may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“ NAI “). To learn more about the NAI and your opt-out options for their members, please visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/.Please note that if you opt-out of online behavioral advertising using any of these methods, the opt-out will only apply to the specific browser or device from which you opt-out. Further, opting-out only means that the selected members should no longer deliver certain Interest-based Advertising to you, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., from other ad networks). We are not responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties’ opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.
You may also limit our use of information collected from or about your mobile device for purposes of serving online behavioral advertising to you by going to your device settings and selecting “Limit Ad Tracking” (for iOS devices) or “Opt out of Interest-Based Ads” (for Android devices).

In addition, Quiet Revolution does not monitor, recognize, or honor any opt-out or do-not-track mechanisms, including general web browser “Do Not Track” settings and/or signals.
**European Data Subjects
Data Controller
EU data protection law makes a distinction between organizations that process personal data for their own purposes (known as “controllers”) and organizations that process personal data on behalf of other organizations (known as “processors”). Quiet Revolution, located at the address in the “How to Contact Us” section below, is the controller with respect to the information you provide through the Website.
Lawful Basis for Processing
Data protection laws in Europe require a “lawful basis” for processing personal data.  Our lawful bases include where: (a) you have given your consent to our processing for a specific purpose, either to us or to our service providers or partners; (b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with you or to comply with a legal obligation; or (c) processing is necessary for the purpose of legitimate interests pursued by DST, and fundamental rights do not override these interests (as further detailed under “Use of Information” above).
Your Rights
If you are a data subject in Europe, you have the right to access, rectify, or erase any personal data we have collected about you through the Service. You also have the right to data portability and the right to restrict or object to our processing of personal data we have collected about you through the Service. In addition, you have the right to ask us not to process your personal data (or provide it to third parties to process) for marketing purposes or purposes materially different than for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you. You may withdraw your consent at any time for any data processing we do based on consent you have provided to us.
To exercise any of these rights, send a written request to us at the address provided under “How to Contact Us” below and specify which right you intend to exercise. We will respond to your request within 30 days. We may require additional information from you to allow us to confirm your identity. Please note that we store information as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which it was collected, and may continue to retain and use the information even after a data subject request for purposes of our legitimate interests, including as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, prevent fraud, and enforce our agreements.
Complaints
If you have any issues with our compliance, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a European supervisory authority. We would, however, appreciate the opportunity to address your concerns before you approach a data protection regulator, and would welcome you directing an inquiry first to us at the address provided under “How to Contact Us” below.
How We Protect the Information
We implement and maintain reasonable administrative, physical, and technical security safeguards to protect the information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. Please understand, however, that no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that the information that you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to and from us over the Internet. In particular, e mail sent to or from the Website may not be secure, and you should therefore take special care in deciding what information you send to us via e-mail.

Please be aware that your information, including your Personal Information, may be transferred to, processed, maintained, and used on computers, servers, and systems located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to use the Website, your use of the Website or provision of any information constitutes your consent to such transfer, processing, and use in the United States and elsewhere as described in this Privacy Policy.
