Quipper | Global Privacy
Quipper Limited (“Quipper ,” “we,” “us”) shares the concerns of visitors (“Visitors,” “you”) to our Internet world wide web site (the “Site”) that links directly to this privacy policy about the protection of personal information online. This privacy policy (the “Policy”) describes our practices regarding the privacy of personal information (information from which a living individual can be identified) that we collect through the Site.
We are a company incorporated in England, number 07472875, and our primary place of business is Wework South Bank Central, 30 Stamford Street, London, England, SE1 9LQ. We strictly comply with the Data Protection Act 1998 principles. This notice sets out how we collect personal data and what we do with it.
We encourage you to read this Policy before using our Site. By using the Site, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Policy. If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of this Policy, please do not use the Site.
Personal Information.
You are not ordinarily required to register or provide Personal Information in order to visit our Site, though certain functionalities (such as a membership program, through which holders will be able to create new applications using our tools and services, uploading, concepts, data, text, software, music, sound, photographs, graphics, video, messages or other materials) may require registration. We collect Personal Information from you only when you voluntarily provide it to us – for example, in contacting us through the Site, answering surveys and polls, download contests, sweepstakes, raffles and similar promotions, signing up for email updates and announcements concerning our products and special promotions. In particular if you wish us to register you with App Store we will have to collect personal information from you, but information collected for this purpose will not be used for anything else. Personal Information may include your contact information (such as your name, postal address, telephone numbers and/or email address).
Use and Disclosure of Information Quipper Gathers Through the Site.
Personal Information. We may use your Personal Information in any of the following ways.
Communications. We encourage Visitors to contact us with questions and comments. Personal Information may be used in order to respond to your questions and comments.
Business Purposes. We may also use your Personal Information for internal business purposes, such as analysing and managing our businesses. The Personal Information you provide through the Site may be combined with demographic information and other information that is publicly available, or with other information about you that Quipper may otherwise obtain online or offline.
Sweepstakes, contests, raffles and other promotions. We may operate sweepstakes, contests, raffles and similar promotions through our services that may require online registration (which may include name, email, user ID and password). We typically ask you for certain Personal Information when you enter and, if applicable, win a sweepstakes, contest, raffle or similar promotion. We may share this Personal Information with third parties sponsors of such sweepstakes, contests, raffles and promotions (irrespective of whether it is hosted by us), or otherwise in accordance with the rules applicable to such sweepstakes, contest, raffle or promotion. You should carefully review the rules of each sweepstakes, contest, raffle and promotion in which you participate through our products, as they may contain additional important information about Quipper’s or a sponsor’s use of your Personal Information. To the extent that the terms and conditions of such rules concerning the treatment of your Personal Information conflict with this Policy, the terms and conditions of such rules shall control.
Special Promotions and Product Information. In addition, Quipper may use your Personal Information to provide you with email updates and announcements concerning our services and special promotions. You may opt-out of receiving these messages from us at any time (see “Contact Us” below).
Critical Communications. From time to time we may use your Personal Information to email you important information regarding the Site, or changes to our terms, conditions, and policies (“Critical Emails”). Because this information may be critical to your use of the Site, you may not opt-out of receiving these emails.
Third Party Service Provider. We work with third parties who provide services, including web site hosting, data analysis, promotional activities, and other administrative services. We may share your Personal Information with such third parties for the purpose of enabling such third parties to provide such services.
Miscellaneous. Finally, we may disclose your Personal Information if we believe that we are required to do so: (i) by law; (ii) to comply with legal process or governmental requests; (iii) to enforce our Terms of Service; (iv) to protect our operations; (v) to protect the rights, privacy, safety or property of Quipper, you or others; and (vi) to permit us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.

If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), you must immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us in accordance with “Contact Us,” below (note that physical mail notification will delay the time it takes for us to respond to the problem).
Assignment. We reserve the right to transfer any and all information that we collect from users of the Site to a third party in the event of any merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of Quipper’s assets or stock (including without limitation in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings).
