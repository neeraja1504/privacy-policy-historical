1.1. Effective Date. The effective date of this Privacy Policy is December 1, 2017. Last Updated: This Privacy Policy was last updated on August 13, 2019.
1.2. Purpose and Scope. Sellers International LLC (“Quimbee” or “Company”) is committed to respecting the privacy rights of users of the Quimbee website, the Quimbee service, and any software applications made available by Quimbee, such as any mobile-device application Quimbee makes available (together, the “Service”). Quimbee is committed to protecting personal data we may collect from visitors and any other individual or entity (“User”, “you”, or “your”) through our compliance with this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”).
1.3. Scope. This Privacy Policy applies to data collection by Quimbee and shall apply to your use of the publicly accessible portions of this web site at https://www.quimbee.com/ (the “Site”) and other Quimbee-related sites, applications, software, communications, capabilities, and services (“Services”). We have established and implemented this Privacy Policy to inform you, the User of the Site, of the type of information collected by us and how we use and protect such information.
1.4. Separate Terms of Service. By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you have also read and understood, and agree to be bound by, both this Privacy Policy and Quimbee’s separate Terms of Service document (the “ Terms of Service ”), which is incorporated by reference and made part of this Privacy Policy. The Terms of Service document is available at https://www.quimbee.com/about/terms.
1.5. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how we will treat it. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, you may choose not to use our Site or Services. By accessing or using this Site or using our Services, you agree to this Privacy Policy. This policy may change from time to time. Your continued use of this Website or use of the Services after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes, so please check the policy periodically for updates.
1.6. Irrespective of which country you live in, you authorize us to transfer, store, and use your information in the United States and any other country where we operate. In some of these countries, the privacy and data-protection laws and rules regarding when government authorities may access data may vary from those in the country where you live. Learn more about our data-transfer operations in the “Storage and Transfer of Information” section below. If you do not agree to the transfer, storage, and use of your information in the United States, and any other country where we operate, please do not use the Sites or Services.
2. When this Privacy Policy Applies.
2.1. Quimbee’s Privacy Policy applies to all of the Services offered by Quimbee, and Services offered on our Site, but excludes services that have separate privacy policies that do not incorporate this Privacy Policy. Our Privacy Policy does not apply to services offered by other companies or individuals, including products or sites that may be displayed to you, or other sites linked from our Services. Our Privacy Policy does not cover the information practices of other companies and organizations who advertise on our Services and who may use Cookies, pixel tags, and other technologies to serve and offer relevant ads.
3. Updates and Changes to Privacy Policy.
3.1. Each time you access the Service, the then-current version of this Privacy Policy will apply. Each time you use the Service, we recommend that you check the date of this Privacy Policy in Section 1.1 (Effective Date) and review any changes since the last time you used the Service.
4. Children’s Privacy.
4.1. Quimbee does not solicit or knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If Quimbee obtains actual knowledge that it has collected Personal Information from a child under the age of 13, Quimbee will immediately delete that information from its database. Because Quimbee does not collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13, Quimbee has no such information to use or disclose to third parties. Quimbee has designed this Privacy Policy to comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”).
5. Information Collection Practices.
5.1. Traffic Data. Like most website and mobile-application operators, Quimbee collects information that web browsers automatically make available, including: (i) IP addresses, (ii) Internet domain names, (iii) types of devices accessing the Service, and (iv) types of Web browsers accessing the Service (collectively “ Traffic Data ”). Traffic Data is not meant to personally identify you, although it may be possible to identify you using Traffic Data in combination with other data.
5.2. Cookie Policy. “ Cookies ” are text files that are placed on your computer by websites that you visit or certain emails that you open. Cookies store a string of information on a user’s computer or mobile device, which the user’s web browser provides to the Service automatically each time it interacts with the Service. The purpose of Cookies is to identify the user as a unique user of the Service or to store the user’s preferences for that website. Quimbee uses two types of Cookies: “first-party Cookies” and “third-party Cookies.”
5.2.1. First-Party Cookies. Quimbee uses first-party Cookies on the Service for the following purposes: (1) to gather visitor and access information relevant to customizing the Service to your interests and (2) to store your user ID so you do not have to re-enter it each time you use the Service.
5.2.2. If you do not wish to have first-party Cookies placed on your computer or mobile device, you should set your web browser to refuse Cookies before accessing the Service. However, certain features of the Service may not function properly without the aid of Cookies. If you refuse Cookies, you assume all responsibility for any resulting loss of functionality.
5.2.3. Third-Party Cookies and Advertising.
5.2.3.1. Advertising on Third-Party Websites. * Quimbee may advertise on other Third-Party Websites to you after you access the Service. We and third-party marketing partners, including without limitation Google, Inc. (“ *Google ”), may use first-party Cookies (such as the Google Analytics Cookie), third-party Cookies (such as the DoubleClick Cookie), and web beacons (such as the Facebook conversion-tracking pixel, see https://www.facebook.com/business/a/online-sales/conversion-tracking), including across multiple devices, to inform, optimize, and serve advertisements to you based on your use of the Service. This practice is commonly known as retargeting or remarketing (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_retargeting).
5.2.3.2. Google Analytics.
5.2.3.2.1. Google Analytics is a web analytics service that helps website and app owners understand how their visitors engage with their properties. It may use a set of Cookies to collect information and report website usage statistics without personally identifying individual visitors to Google. The main Cookie used by Google Analytics is the “__ga” Cookie. Quimbee uses Google Analytics on the Quimbee website.
5.2.4. Opting Out of Third-Party Cookies.
5.2.4.1. You may customize your Google Cookies preferences or opt out of using Google Cookies on the Google Ads Settings page at http://www.google.com/settings/ads.
5.2.4.2. You may learn about Facebook Cookies and how to customize your preferences at https://www.facebook.com/about/ads.
5.2.4.3. You may opt out of using other third parties’ Cookies by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page at http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp. You can also learn more about how to delete or control Cookies at http://www.aboutcookies.org/.
5.3. Third-Party Analytics Services.
Quimbee selects Third-Party Analytics Services to help provide the Service to you; for example, Google Analytics. Quimbee only shares information with the Third Party that is required for the service they are offering and contractually bind these providers to keep any information Quimbee shares with them as confidential and to be used only for particular purposes.
5.4. Analytics Policy and Device Ad ID Collection.
5.4.1. Advertising IDs or “ Device Ad ID ”s are files that are placed on your mobile application by your device manufacturer. More information is available at https://developer.android.com/google/play-services/id.html. The purpose of a Device Ad ID is to identify the user as a unique user of the Service without collecting Personal Information.
5.4.2. Quimbee collects Device Ad IDs.
5.4.3. If you do not wish for Quimbee to access your Device Ad ID, you must inform Quimbee of your opt-out immediately, using the “Contact Us” form available through your account, and then permanently cease all use of Quimbee. If you opt out in this fashion, you assume all responsibility for any resulting loss of functionality.
5.5. Personally Identifiable Information. To use certain features of the Service, you might be asked to provide Quimbee certain personally identifiable information (“ Personal Information ”). Personal Information includes the following categories, without limitation: (1) “ Contact Data ” (such as your name, phone number, fax number, mailing address, and email address); (2) “ Financial Data ” (such as your credit/debit card number, expiration date, and billing address); (3) “ Demographic Data ” (such as your law school graduation date, law school attended, and your billing ZIP code); and (4) “ Third-Party Social Media Account Data ” (such as your account information for third-party social media accounts when you access the Service in connection to those accounts); (5) “ Work History Data ” (such as your resume, including education and experience). In each case, you will be asked to provide Personal Information; the Service will not gather it secretly. Quimbee may supplement the Personal Information you provide with additional Personal Information gathered from public sources or from third parties (e.g., consumer reporting agencies) who may lawfully provide that information to Quimbee. You are under no obligation to provide Personal Information, with the caveat that your refusal to do so may prevent you from using certain features of the Service.

The Service may contain features (e.g., instant messages, electronic messaging, etc.) that allow you to upload, post, transmit, display, perform, or distribute content, or other information, including your Personal Information. Any information that you choose to disclose through such features becomes public information over which Quimbee is unable to exercise control. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your Personal Information through these features, and you agree to assume all responsibility for doing so.
5.8. Mobile Device Information. **** Quimbee may collect: (i) information about the type, make, and model of your mobile device, the operating system you use on the device, browser type and specifications, the network service or wireless communication provider who connects your device to a telecommunications system or systems, your internet protocol address, and other unique identifiers assigned by third parties to your mobile device, and (ii) information about your activity on the device, including your use of other mobile applications on the same device, click data and click patterns in relation to promotional advertising on your device, Cookies (defined above), tracking tags, pixel tags, web beacons, and visitor history.

Quimbee does not attempt to link information gathered using Cookies to Personal Information.
6.2. Personal Information.
6.2.1. Generally. Quimbee will NEVER sell your Personal Information to anyone. Quimbee uses your Contact Data to send you information about Quimbee and Quimbee’s products and services, and to contact you when necessary in connection with the Service.

Quimbee uses your Demographic Data to customize and tailor your experience on the Service. Quimbee uses your Third-Party Social Media Account Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the privacy policies of third-party social media companies, such as Facebook and Twitter.

12. Storage and Transfer of Information.
We may, directly or indirectly through third-party entities around the world, process, store, and transfer all of the information you provide, including your personal information, as described in this Privacy Policy.

We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, taking into account technological reality, cost, the scope, context, and purposes of processing weighted against the severity and likelihood that the processing could threaten individual rights and freedoms. For example, we engage third-party data storage providers who utilize commercially reasonable security measures such as encryption, firewalls, and transport layer security (TLS) or hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) to protect Personal Information.
