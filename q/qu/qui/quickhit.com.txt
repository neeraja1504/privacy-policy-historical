Privacy Policy | Majesco Entertainment
Majesco Entertainment ("Majesco" or “we” “our” or “us”) respects the privacy rights of our online visitors and is committed to protecting the information collected from you. To further this commitment, we have adopted an online privacy policy ("privacy policy") that guides how we collect, use, and disclose the information you provide to Majesco online. If you are a parent or legal guardian and are interested in knowing more about Majesco's policy regarding the collection of information from children under 13, please see our children's section below.  This privacy policy currently applies to websites operated by Majesco with a link to this policy (collectively referred to as "this website" or "our website")
Please note that this privacy policy applies only to information submitted and collected online through the websites, and does not apply to information that may be collected by Majesco offline. In addition, this privacy policy applies to Majesco only, and not to websites maintained by our international affiliates (e.g., Majesco UK) or by other companies or organizations to which we link. When you link to these websites or to any other sites from a website operated by Majesco (as listed above), this privacy policy no longer applies.
** What types of information does Majesco collect and how will it be used?**
In order to give you the best experience on our website, Majesco may collect information about you. We may ask a user to submit personal and/or demographic information in connection with the following activities:
Game specific websites
Registration
Subscription to an electronic newsletter
Participation in online contests, sweepstakes, or other promotions
Accounts necessary to use some of our games.
Personal information collected in conjunction with these activities includes identifying information about you and/or information that could be used to contact you and may include your first and last name, mailing address, telephone number, email address, Internet Protocol (IP) address, photos/videos/audio files and geolocation information. For some activities, we may ask you to create a username and password and to provide other non-personal information such as your age or date of birth, gender, game and platform preferences, and other interests (also known as "demographic information"); and, if collected on a form that also requests personal information, combine such information with your personal information.
In some cases, we may require financial information to make a purchase or for other puposes.  When we collect credit card information online, we will use protective technologies such as SSL encryption to help protect such information.
We may use information that we collect for the particular purpose you provided us the information. For example, if you sign up for our newsletter, the email address that you provide will be used to send you, via email, updates regarding new products, special offers, and other events of interest. Similarly, information collected from those who register on our website is used to provide registrants the benefits that come along with registration, which often include a subscription to our newsletter, product/customer support, and participation in promotions and other activities. In some instances, however, you may also be given the option to have your information used for an activity or service different from the activity or service that you are requesting (e.g., to have your name entered into a contest when subscribing to our newsletter and vice versa). If you choose to receive these additional services, Majesco will use your information to carry out such services.
We may also use the personal and/or demographic information collected through one of the activities set forth above for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the online products and services we provide you and to better meet your needs.
We may also take information you provide use and combine it with other publicly available information about you.
Please note that we are prohibited from conditioning participation in an activity on users disclosing more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in that activity (i.e. requiring a Social Security number for an online contest).
** What happens if I refuse to provide my personal information to Majesco?**
If you choose not to submit personal information when requested, you may not be able to participate in certain activities on our website and may limit the services we can provide you. For example, if you refuse to provide your email address to us, you will not be able to register on our site or receive our electronic newsletter. To simply browse our website, however, you do not need to give us any personal information.
