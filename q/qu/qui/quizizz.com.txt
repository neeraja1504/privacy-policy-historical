Privacy Policy - Quizizz
Updated: February 1, 2015
Your privacy is critically important to us. At Quizizz, these our guiding principles:
We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.
We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of of our services.
We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what’s visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.
It is Quizizz's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website.
This privacy statement describes how Quizizz collects and uses the personal information you provide on our Web site, Quizizz.com. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information.
Website Visitors
Like most website operators, Quizizz collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Quizizz’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Quizizz’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Quizizz may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
Quizizz also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Quizizz does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to Quizizz's website choose to interact with Quizizz in ways that require Quizizz to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Quizizz gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account at Quizizz to provide a username and email address. In all such cases, Quizizz collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Quizizz. Quizizz does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally- identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
Children
For all students, including children under 13, Quizizz offers a limited feature set and web site experience. We do not require students to submit their name or contact information. The only information we collect from students is a temporary nickname. The website also does not allow any type of direct communication to or between the student participants.
Safety on Quizizz
Children’s safety and full enjoyment of Quizizz, as well as the safety and well being for all children and their families, is of the utmost importance to all of us at Quizizz. Quizizz does not accumulate personal information about any child or family for distribution, sharing, or selling except as described in this privacy policy.
Aggregated Statistics
Quizizz may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its website. For instance, Quizizz may monitor the most popular quizzes on the Quizizz site. Quizizz may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Quizizz does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
How We Handle Personally Identifiable Information
Quizizz discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Quizizz's behalf or to provide services available at Quizizz's website and mobile applications, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Quizizz's website and mobile applications, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Quizizz will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Quizizz discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law such as to comply with a court order, or when Quizizz believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Quizizz, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a Quizizz website and have supplied your email address, Quizizz may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Quizizz and our products. We primarily use our product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Quizizz takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information. You may choose to stop receiving our email by unsubscribing.

Parental Rights
Parents and legal guardians of children under 13 who are members of Quizizz.com have certain rights under COPPA, and Quizizz recognizes those rights. Parents/guardians can consent to collection and use of a child's personally identifiable information (PII) without consenting to the disclosure of information to third parties. Currently the only identifiable information we collect from children under 13 is parent's email address.
Parents/guardians can review information their children have contributed to Quizizz.com, by accessing their child's account. Parents can also request that Quizizz delete that information and refuse to allow Quizizz to collect further information from their children by contacting us at contact@quizizz.com. Quizizz may ask additional questions or take other steps to verify the identity of parents/guardians before responding to a request to review or delete their child's information, or a request to refuse further collection from children.
A child's participation or access to an activity on Quizizz cannot be conditioned on him or her providing more information than is reasonably necessary for that activity, or any personally identifiable information. Quizizz does not collect personally identifiable information from children under 13, without a parent or guardian's consent.
