What are cookies and how does Quia Corporation use them?
As part of offering and providing customizable and personalized services, Quia Corporation uses cookies to temporarily store information about you. A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that uniquely identifies your browser. We use cookies to better display our Web site, to save you time, and to provide better technical support. For example, cookies help us to:
(1) keep track of whether a registered user is logged in so that we can display the "Log In" or "Log Out" link as appropriate
(2) remember the last tab you visited in the Instructor Zone so that if you leave the Instructor Zone and return, we can start you on the tab you left off at
(3) know your username when you submit a technical support request so that you don't have to type it in.
(4) remember that you have logged in, so that you don't have to re-enter your username and password every time you go to the Instructor Zone, Student Zone, or other area of our site that is restricted to registered users.
Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some Quia features and services (particularly those that require you to log in) may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.

What else should I know about my privacy?
Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online (for example on message boards, through e-mail, or in chat areas) that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.
When creating materials on the Quia Web site, you may choose whether or not to show your name and e-mail address. If you decide to show your name and e-mail address, you are making it available to others over the Internet. Furthermore, if you have chosen to have your name displayed on your Quia activity pages and you add one of your activities to the Quia shared activities area, your name will appear in the listing of activities. Remember that the choice of displaying your name and e-mail address on the Quia Web site is entirely up to you. By publishing your name and e-mail address, you may receive correspondence from other Quia users. For example, someone may send you an e-mail to let you know that your activity was helpful, or to point out errors in your activity. Many Quia users appreciate the opportunity to receive this kind of feedback; however, the choice to include this information is yours.
Additionally, Quia offers a web-page building tool, specifically designed to allow educators to build custom class Web pages. Just like any other web-page building tool, the pages created can be accessed by anyone over the Internet. Please do not include any information on your web page that you do not want to disclose over the Internet.
