We use your personal data to provide you with an accurate, customised loan contract. Without this data, we may not be able to offer you a loan. Once you submit an application on our website, we gather data from credit reference agencies and other vendors to confirm identity, check for fraud and evaluate creditworthiness.

We may also receive your information from third party credit brokers. As part of your application through any of our partners, you should be informed which companies your data will be shared with.

Such automation ensures that each customer is treated consistently and is evaluated objectively, and allows us to make fair and responsible lending decisions. For more information about your rights as it relates to automated processing, please see the section on Objection to Automated Decision Making, below.

If false or inaccurate information is provided, including in relation to a person's identity and fraud is suspected or identified, details about this information, including customer Personal Data, will be passed to fraud prevention agencies. Law enforcement agencies may access and use this information.
We and other organisations may also access and use this information to: prevent and detect crime, fraud and money laundering, for example when: checking details on applications for credit and credit related and other facilities; managing credit and credit related accounts or other facilities; recovering debt; checking details on proposals and claims for all types of insurance; and checking details of job applicants and employees.
We and other organisations may access and use from other countries the information recorded by fraud prevention agencies. For further details of the relevant fraud prevention agencies please contact us as described at the end of this Privacy Policy.
with credit reference agencies and other vendors to assess creditworthiness, verify your identity and report back on loan performance
We use credit reference agencies (CRAs) to assess your application for credit and verify your identity to prevent crime and money laundering.
We also use other vendors for purposes of verifying your identity and preventing fraud.
We may also, make periodic searches at CRA’s in order to refresh our records and manage your account with us. Information on applications will be sent to CRAs and will be recorded by them.
When CRAs receive a search from us they will place a search footprint on your credit file that may be seen by other lenders. They supply to us both public (including the electoral register) and shared credit and fraud prevention information.
Where you borrow from us, we will give details of your account(s) and how you manage it/them to CRAs. If you borrow and do not repay in full and on time, CRA’s will record the outstanding debt. This information may be supplied to other organisations by CRAs to perform similar checks and to trace your whereabouts and recover debts that you owe.
Records remain on file for 6 years after they are closed, whether settled by you or defaulted. You can contact the CRAs currently operating in the UK; the information they hold may not be the same so it is worth contacting them all. They may charge you a small statutory fee for the provision of information.
