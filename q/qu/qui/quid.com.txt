Quid
At Quid®, we are committed to protecting the privacy of your personal information. It’s yours, it matters to you, and we get that. This Privacy Policy is to let you know what information we use and collect from users of www.quid.com and other Quid URLs and websites (collectively, the “Sites”), the Quid software platform (“Quid Platform”), any of our services (“Services”), and on behalf of our clients. The Sites and the Quid Platform shall be included in the definition of Services for purposes of this Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy applies to Personal Information that is processed by Quid in the course of offering and operating the Services. This Privacy Policy is incorporated by reference into the Quid Terms of Service (“the “Terms”). By using our Sites or Services, you expressly agree to Quid’s collection, storage, use, processing and disclosure of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.
E.U. GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION
Quid has taken steps in an effort to comply with the EU GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION (“GDPR”) as set forth by the Council of the European Union and European Parliament, which became enforceable May 25, 2018, regarding the collection, use, transmission, processing, and retention of personal identifiable data of natural persons from European Union member countries. The GDPR is meant to strengthen the security and protection of personal data and to harmonize data protection laws throughout the EU.
What this means is that we at Quid are committed to protecting your data in a secure and transparent manner. Quid processes, uses, and exchanges personal data for our legitimate business purposes only in the limited uses described herein.
The Quid Platform only requires basic personal information from our users, such as name and email address, to facilitate user management, usage monitoring and provide our Services. Such data is stored in the Quid Platform infrastructure as well as with external vendors to the extent necessary to provide Quid’s Services. Quid does not use personal information for any purpose outside of providing the Services as set forth in this Privacy Policy.

RIGHTS OF ACCESS, RECTIFICATION, ERASURE AND RESTRICTION
You may inquire as to whether Quid is processing personal information about you, request access to personal information, and ask that we correct, amend or delete your personal information where it is inaccurate.

Please include your full name, email address associated with your Account, and a detailed description of your data request. Such requests will be processed in line with local laws.
Although Quid makes good faith efforts to provide Individuals with access to their personal information, there may be circumstances in which Quid is unable to provide access, including but not limited to: where the information contains legal privilege, would compromise others’ privacy or other legitimate rights, where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the Individual’s privacy in the case in question, where the request is manifestly unfounded or excessive, or where it is commercially proprietary. If Quid determines that access should be restricted in any particular instance, we will provide you with an explanation of why that determination has been made and a contact point for any further inquiries. To protect your privacy, Quid will take commercially reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access to or making any changes to your personal information.
