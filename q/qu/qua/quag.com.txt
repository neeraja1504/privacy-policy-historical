REA 1888893, the owner of the web application and Quag.com brand and Controller of the personal data provided by users of Quag.com.

Intent and purpose of data processing
Defined in this statement are the criteria and procedures used by Quentral for processing the personal data provided upon registration with Quag.com and/or published on Quag.com by registered users.
Processing of personal data, in accordance with art. 4, letter a) of Legislative Decree 196/2003, is defined as any operation or set of operations concerning the registration, organisation, storage, consultation, processing, modification, selection, extraction, comparison, use, interconnection, blocking, communication, transmission, cancellation and destruction of personal data.
Therefore, in this section, Quentral intends to illustrate the ways in which the information provided by users when registering and creating their profile on Quag.com will be collected and used, as well as any other information that Quentral acquires as a result of use of the service by all users, both registered and public. Public users are defined as those users who have not yet registered their profile, but who may nonetheless use some of the functions of the application, such as, for example, the search function.
The information provided by users, such as the information required for the registration of a Quag.com account, may be used by Quentral to improve the user experience, for example, by allowing users to receive e-mail notifications regarding the Quag.com service.
We invite all users to read the detailed Statement that follows. In order to complete the registration process on Quag.com and to use the services offered to registered users, said users must give their consent to the processing of their personal data, pursuant to Legislative Decree no. 196/2003.
Users give their consent by creating an account and/or by accessing the site. We nonetheless urge users to carefully read this document and the documents relating to the Terms and Conditions of Use of the Service.
After completing the registration process on Quag.com, registered users may access Member Services and publish content within their personal online profile (including, but not limited to, images, a list of their interests, their gender, nationality, etc.). Such content shall be added voluntarily and at the sole discretion of users, based on their own personal choices and under their exclusive responsibility.
We also wish to inform users – inviting them to take due account of this aspect before making any decision regarding the following – that, by publishing content on the website, they may, even unconsciously provide and disclose additional personal information. The publication of said content (and any personal information that may result or emerge from this content, directly or indirectly) is, in any case, a personal choice freely made by users, entirely of their own volition, with regard to which Quentral is totally extraneous and for which it declines all liability; such choices are made exclusively under the personal responsibility of the user concerned.
Data collected
Upon registration, Quag.com asks users for their personal and identification data, i.e. e-mail address and a password that will become the password to access the service; we remind users that they can also register with Quag.com using their facebook, twitter and/or Google+ profile. By clicking on one of the buttons linked to the social networks in the registration/access window of Quag.com, users will be redirected to the login page of the selected social network, through which, after entering the proper credentials, they will be registered automatically on Quag.com. The registration process cannot be completed without this information and thus users will not be able to become registered users of Quag.com, and it will not be possible for them to use the services Quag.com reserves for its members (for more details about Quag.com services, we recommend reading the Terms and Conditions of Use of the Service).
