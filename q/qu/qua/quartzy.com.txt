How Quartzy Uses Your Information:
Quartzy uses your Personal Data and your Professional Data to contact you regarding: your account, changes to the website, website newsletters, and special offers open to Quartzy users. You may opt-out of these communications if you so choose by contacting us at admin@quartzy.com. Should you opt-out, Quartzy reserves the right to send you notices regarding the status of your account. Quartzy may use Personal Data to contact you, and may also enhance or merge Personal Data with data obtained from other parties for the same purposes.
At times, Quartzy will collect, retain, and use your Personal Data for market analysis. Quartzy may also compile and distribute reports to third parties using Personal Data and Professional Data; however, individuals will never be identified in these reports.
Quartzy may keep a backup copy of all Personal Data and Professional Data for a reasonable period of time to allow the website and its users to revert back to a prior version of that Data.
Personal and Professional Data Sharing
Quartzy users can control the privacy settings of their Personal Data and their Professional Data. Quartzy users may, at any point, modify their privacy settings. You should understand that no security measures are perfect or inviolable, and while Quartzy makes reasonable effort to preserve the integrity of the privacy structure on the website, you post Personal Data and Professional Data at your own risk. Quartzy is not responsible for circumvention of any of our privacy settings. Quartzy cannot guarantee that the Data you submit to the website will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. In the event of a security breach we will notify the affected users and repair the breach in a reasonable amount of time.
Certain aspects of your Professional Data are viewable on Quartzy only by you, certain aspects of your Professional Data are viewable on Quartzy by users you to whom you designate access, and certain aspects of your Professional Data are viewable by all Quartzy users. The extent of data shared is specified by the relationships you have with other users as defined in the Terms of Use. Your Personal data is intended to reflect your research activities and past experience and is by default viewable by both Quartzy members and the general public. Users may elect to restrict access to their personal data to Quartzy members only, and they may exclude their personal email address from all Quartzy users. Relationship definitions do not affect access to Personal Data. Personal data will appear in Quartzy-restricted search results, and may be made available to third party search engines. We do not sell, trade, rent, or otherwise disclose your Personal Data or your Professional Data, other than as stated in this Privacy Policy and in the Terms of Use, unless you have given us written or electronically transmitted permission to do so.
Quartzy recognizes that some Personal and Professional Data is proprietary or otherwise sensitive, and has developed privacy settings to restrict access to these Data. For example, reagents can be stored in user-generated "Private Inventories". When a reagent is placed in a user's private inventory only he or she can see that reagent, and it is not shared among his or her labmates. Users can make adjustments to these privacy settings at any time.
Quartzy works with other companies to provide information technology services to its users. These companies may have access to Quartzy's databases, but only for the purposes of providing service to Quartzy. For example, a third party may obtain access to your Personal or Professional Data in an effort to update database software, or manage data. These companies will operate under consumer confidentiality agreements with Quartzy.
Users should report any unauthorized activity or unauthorized use of information to admin@quartzy.com as soon as they become aware of such activity. Unauthorized use of User Personal and Professional data violates this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use.
Invitations
If you choose to use our invitation service, we will ask you for information needed to send the invitation, such as a colleague's email address. We will automatically send your colleague an email inviting him or her to visit the site. Quartzy stores this information to send this invitation, to register a friend connection if your invitation is accepted, and to track the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact us at admin@quartzy.com to request that we remove this information from our database.
Changes to Business
Quartzy may transfer, sell, or assign information concerning users' use of the site, including without limitation, users' Personal Data and Professional Data, in the event of a change in business practices such as a merger, acquisition by another company, consolidation, liquidation, or reorganization. If such an event threatens to change the manner in which users' Personal Data and Professional Data are handled, they will be notified of such a change and be given the option to delete their account prior to such an event.
Changes to Policies
Quartzy reserves the right to revise or update this policy at any time. If we do so, we will post a new Privacy Policy on the site and/or notify you. We encourage our users to check back frequently for changes. This Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use apply to the Quartzy alpha version and to all subsequent versions.
You may contact us at any time with questions or concerns regarding the Terms of Use or the Privacy Policy at admin@quartzy.com.
