We keep your data for the period required to complete the activities for which it was gathered, but no longer than the limit stipulated by the applicable legislation.
5. Who can we send your data to?
In order to provide our services effectively, we may need to subcontract some tasks, in whole or in part, to technical subcontractors with whom we have entered into contracts (e.g. the subcontractors responsible for maintaining our infrastructure, IT security, hosting, marketing tools, helpdesk and others).
Qualifio requires its subcontractors to adhere to data protection legislation and to submit satisfactory guarantees on the implementation of appropriate technical and organisational measures. They are required to demonstrate that their processing system complies with current data protection legislation and that your rights are guaranteed.
We do not sell or in any way disclose to third parties the data that we gather about you. However, if we have a legal obligation, or if a court ruling requires us to do so, we shall pass on your data to the extent necessary to comply with this law or court ruling.
Under certain circumstances, our website and our apps will provide you with plug-ins for various social networks. If you choose to interact with social network sites such as Facebook or Twitter (for example by setting up an account), your activity on our site or via our apps will also be accessible on that social network site. If you are logged onto one of these social network sites during your visit to any of our sites or apps, or if you interact with any of the social network plug-ins, the social network site may also add this information to your profile on that network, depending on your privacy protection settings. If you want to prevent this type of data transfer, please log off your social network site before logging on to any of our sites or apps, or change the app privacy protection settings, if possible. Please read these social networks’ own privacy protection policies for further details on the collection and transmission of personal data, on your rights, and on how you can achieve a satisfactory degree of privacy protection.
We use a third-party messaging service provider, MailChimp, to send you our e-mails. So that we can send e-mails via MailChimp, we provide MailChimp with certain information, i.e. your e-mail address, your name, your language and your country. MailChimp processes the information on you in accordance with the provisions of its Privacy Policy. MailChimp also uses certain types of technology such as pixels and invisible pixels (“web beacons”) in e-mails sent by MailChimp. This technology tells MailChimp whether you have opened or clicked on our e-mails and, if so, the date, time and IP address used when opening or clicking on them. For further information on the use of this technology by MailChimp, please read their Cookie Statement.
We also use a third-party popup solution, WisePops, to display tailored messages to you and request some of your personal details during your navigation on qualifio.com/blog. You can find more information about the details WisePops collects on this page.

10. Limitation of liability clause
Qualifio’s liability shall be restricted to direct harm, to the exclusion of any indirect loss. Qualifio can never be held liable for harm deemed to be indirect such as, without this list being exhaustive, loss of data, financial or commercial loss, loss of profits, increased general costs, or disruption of planning or scheduling.
Moreover, Qualifio cannot be held liable for any harm arising from any unlawful manipulation of the data by third parties, such as data theft, introduction of viruses, hacking or any other IT malpractices.
We should also highlight the fact that links to our website may contain hypertext links and other references to other sites that we do not manage or control, to which these provisions do not apply. We are not responsible for the content of such websites or the offers, products or services that they contain. We recommend that you carefully read the privacy protection rules of each site that you visit, as those rules may differ from the rules set out here.

All disputes that cannot be settled amicably within a time limit of one month from their occurrence, unless this limit is extended by mutual agreement, may be brought by either party before the French language courts of the Walloon Brabant region. Those courts alone shall have jurisdiction.
