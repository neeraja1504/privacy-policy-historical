Consumer Information
During the process of delivering an ad to you, Quoteland does not collect any personally identifiable information about you such as name, address, phone number, or e-mail address. However, Quoteland does obtain some types of non-personally identifiable information such as the Internet Service Provider you use to connect to the Internet, your browser type, or the type of computer operating system you use (Macintosh or Windows, for example).

If this does occur, Quoteland may collect this information on behalf of an advertiser. This information is used by an advertiser to respond to your request. In addition, Quoteland may combine this information with other users' information and review it in an aggregate form to understand the type of individuals who view a specific type of ad or visit a particular kind of website.
