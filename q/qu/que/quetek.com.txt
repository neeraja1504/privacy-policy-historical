What Information Do We Collect?
When you make a purchase we require the standard information to complete the transaction. The information includes your name, company name, email address, physical address and credit card information. Your name and optional company name are used to identify you. Your email address is used to communicate with you to complete the purchase and provide technical support. Your physical address is used to determine if sales taxes are collectible, such as VAT for the European Union and Texas sales taxes. The credit card information is forwarded to our credit card processors and never saved on our website.

Each Web site can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a Web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites.
