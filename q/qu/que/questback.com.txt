Webtracking

Social networks
Our website uses social plugins ("plugins") from social networks, i.e. facebook (facebook.com), twitter (twitter.com), LinkedIn (linkedin.com) and Google+ (plus.goggle.com). These plugins can be recognized by their respective icons and/or logos.
We only use the share function (“share button”), which allows users to share our content to their profiles on social networks. In the event a user calls up the share function, his computer or device establishes a direct connection to the social network’s servers. Certain information is transmitted to the operator of the social network and, if logged in, integrated into the user’s profile. We have no influence on the type of data social networks actually collect with the help of this plugin. Such information may include session information, user ID, password, IP address and other personal data.
If the user is logged in to the social network, its operator can assign the visit to the user’s profile and identity. The social network is hereby enabled to create profiles on the user. If a user is neither logged in or a member of a social network, it is still possible for any network operator to obtain and store IP address and other data.
Users that do not want social networks to collect personal data via social plug ins must log out of their social network accounts before using our website and/or and delete all relevant cookies.
