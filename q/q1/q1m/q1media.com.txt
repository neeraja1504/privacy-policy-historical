Q1Media, Inc. takes privacy concerns seriously and we strive to ensure that our privacy policy improves the services we provide to advertisers, publishers, and web users in general.
Q1MEDIA, INC. PRIVACY POLICY
This Privacy Policy was last modified on 5/9/2016
This Privacy Policy concerns two different types of users of our services. The first are Internet users who go to a website where our advertising technology is used. The second are publishers (i.e., website owners) and advertisers who register with us via the Internet. The type of information we gather with respect to a web user who is delivered advertising through our advertising technology versus someone who registers with our site is very different. Accordingly, this policy sets forth, in separate sections, our policies with respect to the collection, use, and disclosure of information we obtain from these two different types of users and a third section which is applicable to both types of users, including those visiting our site to view this privacy policy. For purposes of understanding the information that we collect, it is important at the outset to discuss two different types of information that can be obtained from Internet users. Personally Identifiable Information for purposes of this Privacy Policy refers to information that identifies you personally including your name, email address, mailing address, or phone number. This includes any type of information that identifies who you are, rather than an anonymous profile. Anonymous Information includes information that does not personally identify you. Examples include the IP Address of the computer used, web pages you have viewed, search queries, ads you have viewed, date and time of your actions, the location at which you accessed a web page, domain type, and the responses you have made to advertisements. We collect this type of information through technologies that do not identify you as an individual and such information is never associated with your Personally Identifiable Information, even if we have Personally Identifiable Information related to you.
SECTION ONE – INTERNET INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM INTERNET USERS
This section sets out the type of information we obtain from Internet users who happen upon a website that uses our advertising technology. It is important you know that we do not collect any Personally Identifiable Information from such users. We and/or third party advertising technology vendors may use different types of technologies to collect this type of information including cookies. You may elect to not allow us to use anonymous data by following the Opt-Out procedures set forth in the “Option to Opt Out.” Cookies. Q1Media uses “cookies” which are small text files that are transferred to your computer through your web browser by a site or its service provider to capture and remember certain information. Through our proprietary advertising technology we place these anonymous cookie identifiers on your web browser so that we can collect data about your online movements without ever knowing exactly who you are. We collect and analyze your data under an anonymous and randomly assigned name such as “user45,” and each time you use a different browser, a different computer, or a mobile device’s browser you get a different anonymous identifier such as “user97” or “user805.” The Q1Media cookie does not harm your computer or mobile device in any way or provide us with any information about your personal identity. The cookie is not spyware or adware, which are installed to monitor Internet and general computer activity. Most Web browsers have settings so that the browser can refuse cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent.
Third Party Information.
Q1Media partners with third parties who collect information from your Web browser, through “web beacons,” “gif tags,” and the like. This information can include data concerning requests received which is obtained by the web browser. Examples of this type of information include your web browser type, the websites that you visited just before or just after a website displaying our ad or ads, and the dates and times that you visit a website with our ads. The third party may receive information when you interact with our ads by clicking on the ad or associating them with a social media platform, such as Facebook or Twitter. The information a third party may receive from such interaction includes the specific ad clicked on and the specific web page on which the ad is placed. Q1Media may receive information regarding the frequency with which specific ads are displayed to a user. The third party may receive information regarding the frequency with which specific ads are displayed to a user and information regarding click-throughs, i.e., your clicking to a website linked to the ad or links that you share or receive from third parties related to those ads.
HOW DO WE USE INTERNET USER INFORMATION?
The Anonymous Information we gather from Internet users helps us learn how to best provide ad services that are tailored to the needs and interests of a specific anonymous user. In your case, this means that the information obtained anonymously helps us find patterns that allow us better to respond to your needs and interests. For instance, if we have Anonymous Information that a user recently searched for “Hawaii,” we may use that information to decide to display an advertisement for airfare to Hawaii when that user visits a website using Q1Media ads. We also use the information to improve our ads’ effectiveness and not over display the same ad to users.
You may also get cookies from our affiliates and business partners if you use the links on our Site to reach their respective web sites. The use of advertising cookies sent by such third party web servers is standard in the Internet industry. Q1Media does not control these cookies.
DO WE DISCLOSE ANY INFORMATION TO OUTSIDE PARTIES?
Anonymous Information: Non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses. We share such Anonymous Information with our partners, advertisers, and other third parties at our discretion. Compliance with the Law: We may release your information when we believe in good faith that release is appropriate to (a) comply with the law; (b) respond to subpoenas, warrants, or other governmental orders; or (c) protect our or others’ rights, property, or safety.
We receive information about consumers from third parties to enable targeted advertising on the website(s) and application(s) that we support. The collection and use of that data is governed by the privacy policy and legal terms of the data collector and the website using the data; it is not governed by Q1Media.
