The information we collect
Where practicable, we will give you the option of interacting with us anonymously or using a pseudonym. For instance, you do not need to provide any personal information in order to visit the QTAC website and use facilities such as Course Search, nor will you usually be asked to identify yourself if you contact QTAC by telephone with a general enquiry about our services.
We collect the personal information necessary for us to provide you with the services you have requested from us, and to manage your QTAC application. You do not have to provide us with your personal information, but if you do not do so we may not be able to provide you with some or all of our services.
By disclosing personal information to QTAC, you are consenting to its collection by QTAC. If QTAC receives unsolicited personal information about you which it reasonably believes that you have voluntarily disclosed (for instance, if you are listed as the sender on mail containing personal information), this personal information may be included in your QTAC application. This may include personal or sensitive information that QTAC could not have solicited from you. QTAC may choose to destroy unsolicited personal information about you that is not relevant to QTAC's functions.

full name (including any previous name(s))
address(es) (including any previous address(es))

We may collect your information in various ways, including:
QTAC application and other online services

In addition, by providing the details of an authorised person to QTAC you are consenting to the collection of your personal information from your authorised person.
On occasion QTAC may ask you to provide the personal information of another person (for example, the Centrelink Customer Reference Number (CRN) for your parent or guardian if you apply under the Educational Access Scheme). By providing this information you are agreeing that you have provided that personal information with the consent of that individual, and that you have let them know about this Privacy Policy and where to find it. We will only use this personal information for the purpose for which it was collected.
How we use your information
We only use your personal information for the purpose for which it was provided to us, related purposes and as otherwise required or permitted by law.
Such purposes include:
provision of information about any of QTAC's services that may be relevant to you;
provision of information about institution services which may be relevant to you;

any other purposes identified at the time of collecting your information.
We will only use your sensitive information for the purposes for which it was initially collected, other directly related purposes or purposes to which you otherwise consent.
How we disclose your information
Where appropriate we may disclose your personal information to third parties as required to process your QTAC application or to provide you with other services. The way in which these third parties use your personal information is governed by QTAC's Privacy Policy - Corporate.
In addition, by providing the details of an authorised person to QTAC, you are consenting to the disclosure of your personal information to your authorised person.
Your personal information may be disclosed to third parties including:

We will only disclose your sensitive information for the purposes for which it was initially collected, other directly related purposes, purposes to which you consent, and as otherwise permitted or required by law.
Important notice in relation to fraudulent documentation
The Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) authorises QTAC to use and disclose your personal information without following the provisions in this Privacy Policy where QTAC has reason to suspect that you have engaged in serious misconduct in relation to QTAC’s functions, if the use or disclosure of the personal information is necessary in order for QTAC to take appropriate action in relation to the misconduct.
QTAC considers the provision of fraudulent documentation to be serious misconduct in relation to QTAC’s functions. Therefore, if QTAC has reason to suspect that you have presented fraudulent documentation of any kind, QTAC may use or disclose your personal information in a manner inconsistent with this Privacy Policy to the extent required to undertake an investigation into that documentation and to take appropriate action in light of the outcome of the investigation.
Security of your information
We will take reasonable steps (including any measures required by law) to ensure your information is protected and secure.
For any payments you make via our websites, over the telephone or face to face, we use a recognised payment service provider that is required to take reasonable steps to protect your information. We also take reasonable precautions to ensure that any information you provide to us through our websites is transferred securely from our servers to our mainframe computers.
However, no data protection and security measures are completely secure. Despite all the measures we have put in place, we cannot guarantee the security of your information, particularly in relation to transmissions over the internet. Accordingly, any information which you transmit to us is transmitted at your own risk. You must take care to ensure you protect your information (for example, by protecting your QTAC user names and passwords) and you should notify us as soon as possible after you become aware of any security breaches.
Accuracy, access and correction
We take reasonable steps to ensure the information we collect and hold about you is accurate, complete and up-to-date. However, we rely on you to advise us of any changes to your information or corrections required to the information we hold about you.
