This policy describes our commitment to the privacy of your information.
How and What Personal Information We Collect
We will obtain your consent to collect, use or disclose your personal information.
Your consent can be express or implied. An example of express consent is when you provide specific consent by ticking or clicking on a box on an account opening form. An example of implied consent is when you provide us with personal information to open an account; we assume you consent to our collecting, using and disclosing it for the purposes outlined in our New Account Application Form, Customer Agreements & Disclosure Documents and this policy.
When you request or apply for a product, service or information from Qtrade, we may collect information from you directly, other members of Qtrade, your referring or other financial institutions, credit reporting agencies and other third parties approved by you or permitted by law. We ask you to provide only the information that enables us to fulfill your request, respond to your application, meet our regulatory obligations, provide you with better service or offer you products and services that may be of interest. The information required to properly address most of the requests and applications we receive includes:
Identification and contact information , such as your name, address, telephone and fax numbers, email address, date of birth, social insurance number and other identification information required for anti-money laundering and income tax compliance purposes
Financial information , such as your income, net worth, credit history and investment profile

As regulated entities, the companies within Qtrade are required by law or regulation to obtain certain information about you in the course of providing products and services to you. For example, we ask you for your financial, employment, transactional and other information to fulfill our securities regulatory "Know Your Client" obligation. As another example, we collect transactional and other information to meet our securities regulatory gatekeeper obligation and obligation to report suspicious transactions to anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing authorities. The choice is always yours as to whether or not to provide us with your information, however, if you decide to withhold certain information we may be unable or restricted in our ability to provide the products, services or information you have requested.

When we share personal information with our third party service providers or agents, we only disclose the information required for them to perform the relevant services and they are obligated by contract to protect and maintain the confidentiality of the information and to use it only for providing the services. Similarly, when we provide personal information in response to a valid legal or regulatory requirement, we only disclose the information that is required.
We utilize physical and electronic security measures, such as restricted physical or on-line access, encryption, password protection, secure storage facilities and document shredding.

Qtrade has centralized operations for some administrative and operational functions. Accordingly, your personal and account information may be shared by the receiving entity among Qtrade companies in order to establish, service and administer your account or for other purposes described immediately above.

Personal and account information may be shared with product providers such as mutual fund companies where you have instructed us to transact in or investigate such products on your behalf.
Personal health information collected in connection with an application or request for insurance products is only shared with the insurance companies to which we apply on your behalf and our managing and associate general agencies as necessary to process your application or service your policy(ies).
To the extent your financial advisor is dually employed by a Qtrade company and a credit union or other financial services organization, we may share information with the advisor's assistant and administrative or supervisory staff who are employed only by the credit union or other organization, but only for the purposes of facilitating the financial services you are receiving through Qtrade.
With your consent, we may share your personal information with your referring financial institution (if any) and its subsidiaries and affiliates and among Qtrade companies to enable us to better serve your needs and help you to achieve your financial and investment goals. The referring financial institution and other Qtrade companies may use your information in order to better serve your current and future investment and financial services needs, develop and offer suitable products and services to you and to better manage their overall relationship with you.
With your consent, we may also exchange credit information about you with other lenders, credit bureaus or references that you provide to us for verification purposes, and to assess your eligibility for credit.
