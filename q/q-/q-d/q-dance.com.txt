For what purposes will Q-dance use information about you?
Q-dance may use your personal information for the following purposes:
Q-dance will use your email address for creating your personal account. We may also use your email address to send information regarding your account and registration, for example in order to help you to restore your forgotten password, and to login into the Website.
