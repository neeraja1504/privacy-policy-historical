Updated May 22nd, 2018
This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you visit or make a purchase from www.80sTees.com (the "site").
Your Information
We use the information you provide to us in connection with your use of our site (e.g., name, shipping/billing address, phone number, email address and credit card information) for internal purposes, such as confirming and tracking your order, spotting trends, and informing you about 80sTees and our partners. We may maintain a record of your product purchases, and we may also share and/or cross-reference information about you, including, without limitation, contact information and data, with partners to enable them to contact you regarding products and services that may be of interest to you. We may contract with, and share and/or cross-reference such information and data with, third parties to provide certain services including, but not limited to, credit card processing, shipping, data management, security and information verification, and promotional services. We may disclose information when required by law, to enforce our site policies, or to protect our rights, property or safety, and/or the rights, property, or safety of any third party. We may also share information with agencies or companies assisting in fraud protection or investigation, but we will not provide information to these agencies or companies for marketing or commercial purposes.
Please note that we do not alter our site's data collection and use practices when we see a Do Not Track signal from your browser.
Your Credit Card Number
We do not store your credit card information, nor do we have access to your credit card number. All credit card data is processed by a PCI-compliant third party payment processor.
Your Email Address
80sTees will not sell your email address. We will not contact you with promotional email unless you opt-in to our email list. We use your email address to send you transactional email messages. Transactional email messages include: Order Confirmation, Shipment Notification, Delivery Notification, Request for Product Reviews, and any other email communication needed to facilitate your order.
We use a number of services to send both transactional and marketing emails.  These services store your email address for the purpose of maintaining your status as a subscriber, for the purpose of recording whether you have received and/or opened emails from us, and to ensure that all emails that were supposed to be sent to you were actually sent.
You will be given the option to add your email address to our mailing list when you place your order. We suggest you do, because we give out discount coupons and announce sales from our mailing list. You can unsubscribe from our marketing email list here.
Your Phone Number
We only call our customers if it is necessary to ask a question about an order. We do not sell or rent your phone number. We do not like getting sales calls, and we will not subject our customers to it.
Your Physical Address and Contact Information
Contact information from the order form is used to send orders, information and promotions from 80sTees.com. Periodically we may partner with other companies that want to send promotional material via the postal service to our customers.
