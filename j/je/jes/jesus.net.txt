Responding to a request: If you contact us with a question, we may use your personal information to provide you with a response.

Legal, regulatory and tax compliance: Where required we are subject to a legal obligation, we may process your personal information to fulfil that obligation.
Profiling: we try to make our products/services, and the communication about this as relevant and personal as possible. This includes the following: analyzing, collecting and combining (sensitive) personal data with the aim of classifying you in a certain category. Through profiling, we can derive the profile and associated interests and what content you may be interested in. Profiling can have an impact on your privacy. This could be due to incorrect or outdated data that has linked categories to you. If the above is the case, you can contact info@jesus.net. We will then take further measures, such as resetting your profile.
We will only use your information for the purposes for which it was obtained. We will not, under any circumstances, sell or share your personal information with any third party for their own purposes, and you will not receive marketing from any other companies, charities or other organizations as a result of giving your details to us.
We will only share your data for the following purposes:
Third party suppliers: We may need to share your information with data hosting providers or service providers who help us to deliver our services, projects, or fundraising activities and appeals. These providers will only act under our instruction and are subject to pre-contract scrutiny and contractual obligations containing strict data protection clauses.
Right now, we have an agreement with 2 service providers:
StudioDR (situated in Poland).
Savvi B.V. (situated in The Netherlands).
Where legally required: We will comply with requests where disclosure is required by law. For example, we may disclose your personal information to the government for tax investigation purposes, or to law enforcement agencies for the prevention and detection of crime. We may also share your information with the emergency services if we reasonably think there is a risk of serious harm or abuse to you or someone else.
We always aim to ensure that personal information is only used by those third parties for lawful purposes in accordance with this Privacy Statement.
The Site may contain links to other Web sites that are run by third parties such as other organizations, Sponsors, Content Providers and Advertisers.  Once you’ve clicked on a link or button activator for an outside Site, you will leave the Site and be taken to sites that we do not control, and our privacy policy no longer applies on those sites.
You must read the privacy policy of the third-party website concerning how personal information will be used.  We also provide content created by third-parties on certain of our Sites.  We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Content Providers or Third-Party websites.
We use technical and corporate organizational safeguards to ensure that your personal information is secure. We limit access to information on a need-to-know basis and take appropriate measures to ensure that our people are aware that such information is only used in accordance with this Privacy Statement.
We undertake regular reviews of who has access to information that we hold to ensure that your information is only accessible by appropriately trained staff, volunteers and contractors.
Our online forms are always encrypted and our network is protected and routinely monitored.
If you use your credit or debit card to donate to us, buy something or make a booking online, we pass your card details securely to our payment processing partners. We do this in accordance with industry standards and do not store the details on our website.
However, please be aware that there are always inherent risks in sending information by public networks or using public computers and we cannot 100% guarantee the security of data (including personal information) disclosed or transmitted over public networks.
We will keep your personal information in respect of financial transactions for as long as the law requires us to for tax or accounting purposes (which may be up to six years after a particular transaction).
If you request that we stop processing your personal information for the purpose of marketing we may in some instances need to add your details to a suppression file to enable us to comply with your request not to be contacted.
In respect of other personal information, we will retain it for no longer than necessary for the purposes for which it was collected, taking into account guidance issued by the ‘Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens’.
We may use the services of a supplier outside the European Economic Area (EEA), which means that your personal information is transferred, processed and stored outside the EEA. You should be aware that, in general, legal protection for personal information in countries outside the EEA may not be equivalent to the level of protection provided in the EEA.
However, we take steps to put in place suitable safeguards to protect your personal information when processed by the supplier such as entering into the European Commission approved standard contractual clauses. By submitting your personal information to us you agree to this transfer, storing or processing at a location outside the EEA.
Data protection legislation gives you the right to request access to personal information about you which is processed by Jesus.net and to have any inaccuracies corrected. You also have the right to ask us to erase your personal information, ask us to restrict our processing of your personal information or to object to our processing of your personal information.
If you wish to exercise these rights, please write a letter (or an email) and send it along with copies of two separate identification documents which provide photo identification and confirm your address, such as a passport, driving license, or utility bill. Please also provide any additional information that is relevant to the nature of your contact with us, as this will help us to locate your records.
You can send us the documents via post to:
