All activities in which you may engage on this website are voluntary. You are not required to provide any personal information to us unless you choose to access features on this site which require such information. If you do not agree with the terms of this notice or other terms of use on this website, then you should immediately exit this website without providing us with any of your personally identifiable information and discontinue use of the site.
Effective Date and Changes to this Notice
This Privacy Notice is effective as of the date above, and will remain in effect until a new notice supersedes it. We may choose to update this notice at our discretion, so you should check this page periodically as the terms may change from time to time. The most recent version of the notice will be reflected by the "last updated" date noted at the top of the page. In the event of a major change to this Privacy Notice, we will provide a conspicuous message either through the site or via an email address associated with your account informing you of the change.

Information Collected from You
The majority of this site is offered without collecting any personally identifiable information from our visitors. However, we may collect personal information about you in specific instances described below. We may collect the following personally identifiable information: your name, your billing address, your e-mail address, your shipping address, your phone number, your date of birth, your payment information, your geolocation, and the type of browser and computing device you use.
Your information is collected when you create an account on the site, place an order, when you voluntarily submit it to enter contests, to request information, or to update your account on the site. We may use your personal information to respond to a request for information or to award prizes or samples. We do not permit third parties, e.g. advertisers, to collect personally identifiable information about your online activity for their own use when you visit our Web Site.
We may directly contact you with special offers from time to time, but only when you have given us permission to do so. You may decline to receive these offers by leaving unchecked the appropriate box after entering any personal information when you create an account or by clicking the "Email Preference Center" link on your My Account page or in the site’s footer. You may also change your mind and decline to receive special online offers by following the opt-out link in any of our promotional emails or contacting our Consumer Affairs Department (1-800-JB-BEANS).
Types of Non-Identifying Information We Collect
We may also collect general information resulting from your activity on the site, including your preferences, insights, and other tendencies. This may include anonymous "traffic data" or tracking information provided by the website’s host or similar provider or collector of such information (i.e., Google Analytics) that does not personally identify you, but may be helpful for marketing purposes or for improving the services we offer. In addition, when you visit our site, we may also log your anonymous IP addresses, a unique identifier for your computer or other access device. This helps us to learn more about areas of the site that are of the most interest to visitors and diagnose problems with our server, to administer our site, or to display the content according to your preferences.
We also collect non-personal information (type and version of web browser, operating system, and device type) to improve the design and performance of the site.
We employ other companies to perform functions on our behalf related to the site. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), displaying targeted advertisements and processing credit card payments. They may have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. You may opt-out from receiving targeted advertisements from AdRoll, one of our vendors, by visiting the NAI website opt-out page

How We Protect Your Information and Keep Your Information Secure
In order to protect both the personal information and the general information that we receive from you through the website, we have implemented various security measures, including but not limited to PCI compliance protocols, user-created User Name and Password, and data encryption.
Unauthorized Access by Third Parties
Whenever you give out personal information online there is a risk that third parties may intercept and use that information. While we strive to protect your personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online. By using this site, you expressly acknowledge and agree that we cannot guarantee the security of any data provided to or received by us through this site and that any personal information, general information, or other data or information received from you through the site is provided at your own risk.
Links to Third Parties
The Jelly Belly site may contain hyperlinks to websites owned and operated by third parties. Where this is the case, we urge you to review the equivalent data protection, privacy and cookie policies available on such websites. We do not accept any responsibility or liability for the data protection of privacy practices of third parties in relation to such websites and your use of third party websites is entirely at your own risk.
For your convenience and to improve the usage of the website we may insert links to third parties on this site. This Privacy Notice does not apply to such third party websites. These links take you outside our service and off our site and are beyond our control. This includes links from partners that may use our logos as part of a co-branding agreement. The sites those links can take you to have their own separate Privacy Notices and although we seek to protect the integrity of the website, we are not responsible for the content and activities of those sites. Your visits and access to such websites is at your own risk. Please note that those other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information.
Changes to your Personal Information and Data Retention
The information you provide is kept in perpetuity unless and until you decide to delete it. Deletion is destructive, meaning that it will be completely removed from the active database. For backup purposes, older versions of our database are kept for six months or, in some cases, in perpetuity. We encourage you to promptly update your personal information when it changes. You may also cancel your registration at any time and you may opt out of receiving any promotional e-mails from us. Additionally, you can choose to have all your personal information updated or deleted from our database by notifying us at webqa@jellybelly.com.

Bus. & Prof. Code §§ 22575(b)(5).
