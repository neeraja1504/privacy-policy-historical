Disclosure Policy
The purpose of JenniferMaker.com is to help you create genuinely amazing things, be they crafts, food, or DIY projects. By sharing how I’ve made things, I hope to inspire and teach you to do it yourself, too!
I have a number of costs associated with running a blog of this size — server space, technical tools, and more. To offset this, I use affiliate links in posts when they are available.
The Federal Trade Commission {FTC} revised their guidelines regarding endorsements and testimonials in order to protect the public from any intentionally errant or misleading advertising that has been paid for by a group or company. Since the JenniferMaker blog is a source of income and may occasionally incorporate endorsements or testimonials, I felt it was important to disclose the following to you, my readers:
The content of the JenniferMaker blog is a source of income for me and therefore may be used to promote products, services, or other businesses at my sole discretion.
I will only choose to promote products/services/businesses that I have, in fact, used and that I feel will be beneficial to our readers. I feel very strongly about this. I always try before I recommend.
Products provided by my advertising partners for my review are given to me free of charge with no cost to myself. This does not ensure a positive review of the product in any way.
You can trust me.  I will always give my genuine opinion about a product or service whether or not I am partnering with the service provider and/or receiving payment to do so.
My number one priority is accuracy and fairness to my readers, and I would  never  compromise the truth just to make a buck. Ever. It’s not worth it to me and it’s not cool to you.
Mentions of associated products/services/businesses within the content of my blog may or may not be noted as an affiliate in every reference.
Integrity is the cornerstone of my code of ethics, and I hold myself to the highest standards of accuracy and strive to deliver interesting, helpful, and encouraging content while generating a small profit to compensate for my time, research, and ideas. I  love and appreciate my readers and make it my goal to be up front and honest with every post I write.
