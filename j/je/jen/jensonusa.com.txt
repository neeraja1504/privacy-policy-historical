Prices shown in currencies other than USA Dollars are estimates based on current exchange rates. We will charge your credit card in USA Dollars on the day your order is shipped, and the conversion to your local currency will be done at the prevailing rate by your credit card issuer.
Shipments outside the USA are declared as “bike parts” for customs purposes and will include the actual amount paid for merchandise and shipping. Jenson USA will not mark your parcel as a “gift”, declare a value lower than the actual price paid, or otherwise prepare false customs information.
