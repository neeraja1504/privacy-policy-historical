About Jenn
I have a smart mouth, don't sit still well, extremely opinionated, have a lot to say, work hard, love lots, love to smile and laugh, don't have time for drama, hurting people, or being negative, love animals, & my job as a New Mexico mom blogger! I love sharing travel adventures, tech gadgets, recipes, parenting struggles (success), crafts, helpful tips, giveaways and sweepstakes, product reviews, and more.  I have amazing 4 children, and am married my soul mate. When I'm not blogging, you'll find me spending time with my family, traveling, cooking, geeking out on tech, plotting the next home improvement, create crafts with the kids, and hang with my pitbull Skittles and newest bunny, Bun Bun. New Mexico born, moved all over, and meet my husband in Carlsbad, NM. We are plotting our move to greener pastures, with trees, and stuff. Connect with me on Google + Page.
