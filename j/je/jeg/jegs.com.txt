Track Tested: We race what we sell When you see the "TRACK TESTED" logo you can feel confident that this manufacturer has our official JEGS approval. Exclusively at JEGS, select manufacturers have been put to the test by our Championship Pro Stock Car and Sportsman race teams. The NHRA circuit provides the most demanding conditions possible for the daily use and abuse of our Track Tested manufacturers. Only after surviving these tests are manufactures given the Track Tested approval. We want you to know that when you buy a Track Tested product that you are buying with confidence. That is why, when you see the Track Tested logo, you know it is a winner! (The Track Tested is a designation of JEGS Automotive, Inc. It is not a representation of warranty of any kind respecting the products with which it is used.)
