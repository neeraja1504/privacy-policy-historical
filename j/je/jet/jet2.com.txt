Where does your personal data come from?
Essential Information
Most of the data we process about you comes from you, for example, information you provide to us so that we can fulfil your travel booking.
Other information is gathered during your use of our websites (e.g. IP addresses or information obtained via cookies) and from your interaction with us at airports and hotels (e.g. data we may receive from airport check-in systems).
Detailed Information
A lot of the data we process is data which you provide to us, such as your name, contact details, payment card information, date of birth etc.  You usually provide this information when you make a booking via our websites or call centre, or when you contact us via email, letter or phone.
If you use social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, booking engines or personal banking sites, these sites are operated by third party providers and they may share your personal data with us.
Cookies
Essential Information
Similar to other commercial websites, our websites utilise a standard technology to collect information about how our website is used by individual computers connected to the internet.
This information is gathered through "Cookies". Cookies are small files of letters and numbers that we put on your computer's hard drive. These small files allow us to distinguish you from other users of our website, monitor website traffic and to personalise the content of the site for you. This ultimately helps us provide you with a good experience when you browse our websites and improve the content of our marketing and allows us to improve our site going forward.
Please note however that Cookies cannot retrieve any personal data from your hard drive or pass on computer viruses.
Detailed Information
To find out more about our use of cookies please read our cookies policy here.

Do you have to provide your personal data?
Essential Information
In most cases, providing your personal data to us is optional, however, if you do not provide it, we will probably not be able to fulfil your booking.  For example, if you book a flight with us, we need details such as your name and passport details to be able to complete your booking and we will need your payment card details to take your payment.  When you make a booking, we will only collect information which is required for the purpose of your booking.  In other cases, you have a choice over whether we collect your personal data, for example, you can turn off cookies on your browser and we will not place any cookies on your device or computer (although in this case you may not be able to use all parts of our website).  Sometimes, we are required by law to collect certain data for border control purposes and where you have booked a flight with us you cannot prevent this collection of data other than by choosing not to check-in for this flight.

In the course of doing so we may sometimes transfer data outside of the UK and when we do so we make sure that it is protected to the same standards as in the UK.
In relation to passengers making reservations to destinations in the United States of America we are required to transfer to the US Department of Homeland Security ( "DHS" ) certain travel and reservation data about passengers flying between the European Union and the United States of America in accordance with an International Agreement between the European Union and the United States.
US authorities use this information for preventing and combating terrorism and other transnational serious crimes. For further information about the way in which the DHS uses this data please see : www.dhs.gov and this PDF. Depending on the country you are travelling to we may also be required to share your information with other border agencies.
Detailed Information
The types of third party service providers who we share your data with include companies which help us understand our customer behaviour or help improve our website, local airports and third party ground handlers who help provide services to you and our local partners in relation to package holidays.  We always have contracts in place with these third parties which require them to properly protect your data and only use it for the purposes of providing the particular service.
Where hotels which you stay in make decisions themselves about how to use your personal data they will be the data controller of that information and we would encourage you to read their privacy policy to understand how they handle your information and how to exercise your rights.
As part of providing your holiday we will engage local operators (for example, to arrange airport transfers) and we will share your personal data with them so they we can make sure your holiday runs smoothly.
If we sell or buy any business or assets, we will disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets, and if we or part of our business is acquired by a third party, personal data about our customers will be transferred to that third party.
In the event of medical emergency during a flight we may share personal data with third party service providers to call for advice for the purposes of managing and recording passenger medical issues. Your personal data may also be included in a flight report which is sent to the flight operator.
If you purchase car hire through Jet2holidays we will transfer your personal data to Rental Cars (Travel Jigsaw Limited) to provide you with car hire services. Jet2holidays and Rental Cars will be independent data controllers in respect of that information. Rental Cars will use the information in accordance with their privacy policy https://www.jet2carhire.com/PrivacyPolicy.do
