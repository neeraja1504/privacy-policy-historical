Detailed Information
**** The types of third party service providers who we share your data with include companies which help us understand our customer behaviour or help improve our website, local airports and third party ground handlers who help provide services to you and our local partners in relation to package holidays.  We always have contracts in place with these third parties which require them to properly protect your data and only use it for the purposes of providing the particular service.
Where hotels which you stay in make decisions themselves about how to use your personal data they will be the data controller of that information and we would encourage you to read their privacy policy to understand how they handle your information and how to exercise your rights.
As part of providing your holiday we will engage local operators (for example, to arrange airport transfers) and we will share your personal data with them so they we can make sure your holiday runs smoothly.
If we sell or buy any business or assets, we will disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets, and if we or part of our business is acquired by a third party, personal data about our customers will be transferred to that third party.
In the event of medical emergency during a flight we may share personal data with third party service providers to call for advice for the purposes of managing and recording passenger medical issues. Your personal data may also be included in a flight report which is sent to the flight operator.
