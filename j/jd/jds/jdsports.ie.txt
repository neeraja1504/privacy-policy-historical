What do we do with your data?
We use your data to fulfil any orders you place with us. We also share your data with third party service providers who help us to do this and to generally operate our business effectively.
We also use your data for marketing purposes which may mean that you will receive marketing communications from us, other companies within the JD Sports Fashion Group or carefully selected third parties.
