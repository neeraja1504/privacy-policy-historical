**Introduction and Summary.   **
This policy is intended to inform you about how we collect and use your Information. Although we encourage you to read the entire Policy, the following provides a summary of some of the important aspects of our privacy practices:
We use your Information primarily to provide you with access to our Platforms and other products, services, and information we offer.
We combine or link Information that we collect about you from our different interactions with you, both online (e.g. via our Platforms) and offline (e.g. via our events or via calls to customer support).
We share your Information across the JDA Subsidiaries in our organization and combine the Information we collect through one Subsidiary with Information collected through other Subsidiaries.
We share your Information with certain trusted third parties as outlined below.
We take reasonable and appropriate measures to secure your Information, but we cannot promise, and you should not expect, that your Information will remain secure in all circumstances.
Information Received, Collected, and Obtained by JDA.   The information we receive, collect, and obtain includes information that is both Personal and Non-Personal.  “ Personal ” information is a broad concept and refers to any information relating to an identified or identifiable living individual. This includes references to obvious identifiers such as name but also non- obvious identifiers such as an identification number or an online identifier such as an IP address or cookie identifier. “ Non-Personal ” information refers to information that is anonymous whereby you are not or no longer identifiable from that information.
We receive, collect, and obtain the following general types of Personal and Non-Personal information (together, “ Information ”):
Information Obtained Directly from You.   We collect Information about you directly when you voluntarily provide it to us through the Platforms or other interactions with us such as your name, contact information, gender, preferred language, job title and function, user name and password, billing information and information about your access to and use of the Platforms and your contacts with other users through the Platforms, as well as other Information you may volunteer to us (e.g. event feedback, profile photo, business card).
