TRANSACTION SECURITY AND WEBSITE MISUSE
To provide you with the best services and to allow you a secure experience regarding the payment and the delivery of your orders, we will use some of your data in order to prevent and to avoid any misuse of this Site. We have asked our service supplier, Sift Science, Inc., to test such data on an automated basis.
Concerned data are: data regarding the implementation of the contract (purchased items, personal information, payment method and banking data), data relating to your visits on this Site (information about visited web pages and click paths), together with anonymous data of your terminals used to visit the Site (resolution of your monitor or version of your operating system), and that can be used to recognize your terminals on subsequent visits with a certain degree of probability.
Following such test and depending on the result, we may decide to implement any relevant security measures or, when the transaction security can’t be ensured, we may decide to cancel the order. In case of an incident, such as fraudulent use of the means of payment or fraud with the delivery, the data relating to the order will be stored in a specific file which would allow us to conduct any relevant additional verification for future orders. You will be notified of any test conducted by us, allowing you to express your observations.
