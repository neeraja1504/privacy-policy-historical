In addition, our Site gathers certain usage information like the numbers and frequency of visitors to the Site and its areas, activity levels, most used browsers, and other useful statistics similar to the television ratings which tell how many people tuned into a program.
Do we use Cookies on our site?
Yes. Cookies, tags, and related tracking technologies (“Cookies”) are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser, your device, or the page you are viewing that enables the Site to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. We use Cookies to help us understand and save your preferences for future visits to the Site. For example, when you return to the Site after prior visits, Cookies provide information to the Site so that it will immediately recognize you as a return visitor, which can improve your browsing experience and save you time when returning to the Site or specific pages on our Site. We also rely on Cookies from our third party advertising providers to better understand how you interact with the Site and other websites you may visit, in order to present advertising that may be of interest to you (also known as interest-based advertising).

These Cookies collect data tied to a user’s IP address such as the length of time a user spends on a page, the pages a user visits, and the websites a user visits before and after visiting jbhunt.com. Based on this information, Google Analytics compiles aggregate data about Site traffic and Site interactions, which we use to offer you a better experience when you visit jbhunt.com.

How We Protect the Information We Collect
The security and confidentiality of your personal information is important to us. We have implemented technical, administrative, and physical security measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access or disclosure and improper use. For example, we use 256-bit Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption to protect the data collection forms on the Site. In addition, access to your personal information is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the personal information to perform a specific job (for example, a customer service representative) are granted access to personal information. All employees with access to personal information are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. After a new policy is added, these employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to enhance protection for our customers' personal information. In addition, the servers that we use to store personal information are kept in a secure, restricted access area.
It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your computer and to your account. Be sure to log out of your account or to close your browser after you have completed your visit to our Site.
Please note that despite our reasonable efforts, no security measure is ever perfect, so we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information.
