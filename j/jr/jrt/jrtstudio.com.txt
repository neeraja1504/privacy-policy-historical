Privacy Policy | JRT Studio
When do we collect information?
We collect information from you when you register on our sites, e-mail us directly or use any of our software. We collect anonymous analytics and we also collect crash reports without any personally identifiable data.
What information do we collect?
E-Mail Address: When you enter your information, as appropriate, you may be asked to enter your: name or e-mail address. You may, however, visit our site anonymously. Our Android applications never send us your email address. If we someday need your email address, we'll ask you for it.
Analytics: Our Android application may collect non-identifiable information from you using Google’s Firebase. This information includes things like how long you used the app for or which buttons you pressed.
IP Address: We do not collect your IP address, but this information is printed in the log files of our servers. The log files on the server are temporary and are generally overwritten in under twenty-four hours.
Crash Reports: We collect crash reports that show us where our code crashed. These reports contain information about the code, as well as device information like which operating system you are using and how much RAM was available at the time of the crash.
Ads: If you are viewing ads on Android, we may have Google Analytics Advertising Features on. This allows Google Analytics to show you more relevant ads, and allows us to see the demographics of our users. We do not sell or re-distribute this information. You can opt out of this advertising inside the "Google Settings" app on your device, if you want to.
Song Listening Information: Our Rocket Player and Songlytics application have features that backup your song listening information, such as how many times you’ve listened to a song, or what you’ve rated it. If you sign in with Google, this information is pseudo-anonymous. It would take extremely powerful computers a long time to figure out the song information is related to you. If you sign in using Spotify, this information can be directly tied to you.
What do we use your information for?
Any of the information we collect from you may be used in one of the following ways:
To personalize your experience:
(your information helps us to better respond to your individual needs)
To store application data:
(your information helps us restore settings and backup useful information)
To improve our software:
(we continually strive to improve our software offerings based on the information and feedback we receive from you)
To improve customer service:
