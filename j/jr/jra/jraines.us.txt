Information Collected by Third-Parties and Your Ad Choices
Third parties may collect information about you through the Service, including through use of the technologies described above. We may not have access to, nor control over, these third parties' data collection practices and we do not assume any liability related to their collection or use.

Do Not Track Browser Disclosure
Do Not Track ("DNT") is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services.
We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our Websites for third party purposes, and that is why we provide the NAI "Consumer Opt-out" link and the DAA opt-out link above. However, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT.
Interacting with Other Users
The jraines.com service is designed to allow people to collaborate. As such during your interactions with other users when you are Logged-In may expose you to opportunities to exchange information that is both personally identifiable and possibly intended to initiate contact beyond the scope of the Service. You should use reasonable and prudent caution with what you disclose publicly and to individuals.
First, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit publicly might be read, collected, or used by other users of the service, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages, mine your data, communicate with or market to you in other ways. We are not responsible for personally identifiable information you choose to disclose publicly and the Company has no responsibility to publish, take down, remove or edit any of your activities or any of your submissions that are a result of your public activities. For more information, see the jraines.com Service Agreement.
Second, the Service features content provided by independent users that are not vetted by the Company nor are they employed by the Company. If you contact another user, or another user contacts you, directly or indirectly via explicit or inferred information exposed by your use of the Service or other services, then that communication is independent of the Service, and thus not subject to this Privacy Policy. The Company is not responsible for what users may say, or how they may use information provided to them.
