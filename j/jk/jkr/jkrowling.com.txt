YOUR INFORMATION
We will not collect information that personally identifies you. We do not collect any personal data.
COOKIES
Like many online services, the site uses a feature called a cookie, which is a small data file that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer or device’s hard drive.
The site uses cookies that automatically log certain non-personal information, including aggregated, statistical data about how you are using the site to analyse its performance and usage. This information may include the URL of the website which linked you to the site, your IP address and the number and duration of visits to the site. The IP address indicates the location of your computer on the internet. This information is collected in an anonymous way that does not identify you personally.
Various different types of cookies are used via the site:
“Session cookies” are used (which will usually be deleted when you log out) to keep track of your internet session, which, for instance, allows the Company to remember the site language. Without these cookies the online services that you have asked for cannot be provided. Session cookies are necessary and/or useful for the functioning of the site
“Persistent cookies” are used (which are longer-term) to help you move around and enjoy the features on the site more easily and to remember preferences, actions and settings to improve your visit (at your request).
The cookies outlined above expire after varying periods from around 30 minutes up to 2 years or more. The length of time that a cookie remains on your computer or mobile device depends on whether it is a “persistent” or “session” cookie. Session cookies last until you stop browsing and persistent cookies last until they expire or are deleted.
In further detail, the cookies fall into the following categories:
1 Analytics (e.g. Google Analytics; Webengage)
These cookies are used to compile various (anonymised) metrics for our users to get a better understanding of how the site is used (pages visited and time spent on the site, for example), so that the Company can deliver more of the content you want, and less of the content you don’t. This information also helps us to make better decisions for our future initiatives. We use partners like Webengage and Google Analytics. These analytics cookies are set by those partners, and are in accordance with the relevant partner’s own privacy and cookies policies.
2. Performance data
This lets us track how long it takes users to load each page, what pages we can cache.
3. Embedded video (YouTube)
We know that many of you love films, so the site may make use of clips on YouTube. YouTube sets its own cookies, and the YouTube cookies policy can be found here.
4. Social media (Twitter)
J.K. Rowling isn’t just a master of novel writing – she’s also pretty handy within the confines of 140 characters! The Company uses cookies to enable you to enjoy the social media features on the site. In order to host her tweets, we embed Twitter links. Twitter sets its own cookies, and Twitter’s cookies policy can be found here.
5. Preferences
The Company uses this type of cookie to ensure that it doesn’t show you things you’ve already seen before, like the cookie policy acceptance and the intro page. This means you get to spend more time with the content you love, and less time with the content you don’t.
6. Session state
Websites often collect information about how users interact with a website. This may include the pages that users visit most often, and whether users get error messages from certain pages. The Company uses these so-called “session state cookies” to help us improve the Company’s services, in order to improve our users’ browsing experience. Blocking or deleting these cookies will not render the site unusable.
By agreeing to the Company’s Terms and Conditions, you agree to the Company using the cookies and your information in these ways, but you can delete any of these cookies at any time if you wish.
You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the setting on your web browser that allows you to refuse the setting of cookies, or you can modify your browser so that it notifies you when cookies are sent to it. The Help portion of your browser, most likely found on the toolbar, typically tells you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. You can check whether these settings are currently enabled on your computer – or find out how to change your current settings – here:
