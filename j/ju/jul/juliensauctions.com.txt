1. What we don't do
We do not "harvest" email addresses from our website visitors or anyone else, nor do we send unsolicited commercial bulk email (spam) to our customers or website visitors.
2. Your information
Personal and/or business information provided to us by our website visitors and customers is treated confidentially and is not sold to anyone for any reason. If you provide such information to us by email, telephone, letter, an online form on our website or other means, we use that information only to provide you with our services and/or products or to respond to your requests.
Our online inquiry forms collect some or all of the following personally-identifying information:
Name
Company
Address
Telephone number
Email address
None of the above personally-identifying information is stored on our website, and thus we provide no online process for individuals to review and request changes to any of their personally identifiable information collected through our website's online forms or sent by email to us.
3. Online store
our shopping cart takes credit card orders securely, and collects the following personally-identifying information:
Name

Shipping Address (if different)
Telephone number

Credit card information (credit card numbers are not retained after purchase)
MYACCOUNT: when you make a purchase, our shopping cart allows you to set up an account that contains your contact information (name, address, email), any saved shopping cart contents, wish list, download links, and purchase history. No credit card numbers are retained at juliensauctions.com. You may change your account information at any time by logging in to MyAccount with the username and password you specified when setting up your account.
COOKIES: cookies are little bits of information stored in a file on your computer. This website uses cookies in its shopping cart to enable customers to complete purchases, and to remember MyAccount login information if they opted to use the MyAccount feature.

We use this information only to understand how many visitors we get and how visitors use our website so that we can improve it. We do not sell this information to anyone for any reason. Simply surfing our website will not impart other personally-identifying information to us.
