We recommend that you read this Privacy Policy in full to ensure you are fully informed. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or Jumpshare's information collection, use, and disclosure practices, please contact us at legal@jumpshare.com.
2. What Information We Collect
A). Information You Provide To Us
Account Information: We collect your information when you use our Service, like your name, email address, and phone number, when you sign up to our Service, upgrade your account, and set up two factor authentication. Additionally, we may collect other information after signing up if it is necessary to provide you with our Service (for example, billing information if you subscribe to a paid portion of our Service). The information we collect from you, is disclosed only in accordance with our Terms of Service and/or this Privacy Policy.
Payment Information: In order to process payments i.e. your subscription, we use a third-party payment processor Stripe. When you enter your payment information on your Account, that information is sent to Stripe. It is sent securely and we never store it on our systems. We do however have access to your subscriber information via Stripe. This information includes what plan you're subscribed to, when your plan expires, etc.
Your Stuff: Our Service is designed to make it simple for you to store your files, comments, messages, and so on (“Your Stuff”), and to make it easy to collaborate with others, and work across multiple devices. To make that possible, we store, process, and transmit Your Stuff as well as information related to it. This related information includes your profile information that makes it easier to collaborate and share Your Stuff with others, as well as things like the size of the file, the time it was uploaded, collaborators, and usage activity. Our Service provide you with different options for sharing Your Stuff. You retain ownership of any intellectual property rights that you hold in Your Stuff. In short, what belongs to you stays yours.
Contacts: You may choose to give us access to your contacts to make it easy for you to share and collaborate on your files, send messages, and invite others to use the Service. If you do, we’ll store those contacts on our servers for you to use.
B). Information We Collect When You Use Our Service

Cookies: Whenever you visit our Site, we may collect non-identifying information from you, such as your IP address, referring URL, browser, operating system, cookie information, and Internet Service Provider. Without a subpoena, voluntary compliance on the part of your Internet Service Provider, or additional records from a third party, this information alone cannot usually be used to identify you.
Device Information: We collect information from and about the devices you use to access the Service. This includes things like IP addresses, the type of browser and device you use, the web page you visited before coming to our sites, and identifiers associated with your devices.
C). Information We Receive From Third Parties
Third-Party Accounts: If you choose to link our Service to a third-party account for example Google Login, we will receive information about that account, such as your authentication token from the third-party account, to authorize linking. If you wish to limit the information available to us, you should visit the privacy settings of your third-party accounts to learn about your options.
3. Why We Collect Your Information

Develop new products, services, features, and functionality.
Enable you to access and use the Jumpshare Service, including uploading, downloading, collaborating on and sharing Content.

4. How We Share Your Information
Other working for Jumpshare: Throughout the course of our provision of our Service to you, we may delegate our authority to collect, access, use, and disseminate your information. For example, our web host Amazon Amazon Web Service, stores the information that you provide us, and we may hire outside contractors to perform maintenance or assist us in securing our website.
It is therefore necessary that you grant the third parties we may use in the course of our business the same rights that you afford us under this Privacy Policy when they work on behalf of Jumpshare. For this reason, you hereby agree that for every authorization which you grant to us in this Privacy Policy, you also grant to any third party that we may hire, contract, or otherwise retain the service, to the extent that the authorization is used to provide you with the Jumpshare Service.
You agree that if any of these third parties commit any civil or criminal wrongs with your information, you will hold them responsible for it and not attempt to recover any damages from Jumpshare, even if the law says that Jumpshare could be held liable as well.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you authorize us to use Google Analytics, for general web analytics purposes.
Other Jumpshare users: Our Service displays information like your name, profile picture, device, and email address to other users in places like sharing notifications. You can also share Your Stuff with other users if you choose. When you register your Jumpshare account with an email address on a domain owned by your employer or organization, we may help collaborators and administrators find you and your team by making some of your basic information like your name, team name, profile picture, and email address visible to other users on the same domain. This helps you connect with teams you can join and helps other users share files and folders with you.
Other applications: You can also give third-party providers access to your information, for example, via Google Login. Their use of your information will be governed by their privacy policies and term and not those of Jumpshare.
Jumpshare Team Admins: If you are a user of a Jumpshare team (e.g., Jumpshare Business plans), your administrator may have the ability to access and control your Jumpshare team account. Please refer to your organization’s internal policies if you have questions about this. If you are not a Jumpshare team user but interact with a Jumpshare team user (by, for example, accessing stuff shared by that user), members of that organization may be able to view the name, email address, profile picture, and IP address that was associated with your account at the time of that interaction.
Sale of Business: We reserve the right to transfer information to a third party in the event of a sale, merger or other transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of Jumpshare, or that portion of Jumpshare to which the Service relates, or in the event that we discontinue our business or file a petition or have filed against us a petition in bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding, provided that the third party agrees to adhere to the terms of this Privacy Policy.
Legal Purpose: At times it may become necessary, for legal purposes, to release your information in response to a request from a government agency or a private litigant. You agree that we may disclose your information to a third party where we believe, in good faith, that it is desirable to do so for the purposes of a civil action, criminal investigation, or other legal matter. In the event that we receive a subpoena affecting your privacy, we may elect to notify you to give you an opportunity to file a motion to quash the subpoena, or we may attempt to quash it ourselves, but we are not obligated to do either. We may also proactively report you, and release your information to, third parties where we believe that it is prudent to do so for legal reasons, such as our belief that you have engaged in fraudulent activities. You release us from any damages that may arise from or relate to the release of your information to a request from law enforcement agencies or private litigants.
5. Your Right To Control, Access, And Change Your Information
You have control over your personal information and how it is collected, used, and shared. For example, you have the right to:
Review and edit the personal information you have provided to us from the Settings page. Although most changes may occur immediately, information may still be stored in a web browser's cache. We take no responsibility for stored information in your cache, or in other devices that may store information, and disclaim all liability of such. In addition, we may, from time to time, retain residual information about you in our backup and/or database.
