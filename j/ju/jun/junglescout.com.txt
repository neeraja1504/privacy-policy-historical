Jungle Scout Privacy Policy
Last Updated February 3rd, 2016
Website Visitors
Like most website operators, Jungle Scout collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Jungle Scout’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Jungle Scout’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Jungle Scout may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
Jungle Scout also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on our blog. Jungle Scout only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to Jungle Scout’s Website choose to interact with Jungle Scout in ways that require Jungle Scout to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Jungle Scout gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. Those whom  engage in transactions with Jungle Scout are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Jungle Scout collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Jungle Scout. Jungle Scout does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
Aggregated Statistics
Jungle Scout may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its website. Jungle Scout may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Jungle Scout does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
Jungle Scout discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Jungle Scout’s behalf or to provide services available at Jungle Scout’s website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Jungle Scout’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Jungle Scout will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Jungle Scout discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Jungle Scout believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Jungle Scout, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a Jungle Scout website and have supplied your email address, Jungle Scout may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Jungle Scout and our products. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Jungle Scout takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

Business Transfers
If Jungle Scout, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Jungle Scout goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Jungle Scout may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.
