Cookies
This website uses cookies. A cookie is a small text file with an identification number which, when using our website, is transferred and recorded on your computer, together with the other, requested data. Storing these cookies helps us to tailor our website accordingly to you and makes it easier to use, for example by saving certain information you enter so that you don’t have to constantly re-type it. The file is kept ready for later access and serves to authenticate the user.
As cookies are just simple files and not executable programs, they pose no danger to your computer. Depending on the chosen preferences in your internet browser, it may automatically accept cookies. This preference can be changed, and the storage of cookies completely disabled or deactivated in such a way that the user is notified as soon as a cookie is saved. In the case of a complete disabling of cookies, however, certain functions of the website will no longer be available or only in a limited form.
1. Session cookies
Session cookies are deleted once you close your browser.
2. Permanent cookies
We also use cookies that remain on your hard drive. Their expiration date is set to a date in the future. When visiting our website again, permanent cookies automatically recognise that you were already here and which options and settings you prefer, along with any text you may have entered into fields on our forms.
3. Use of third-party cookies
We work with several advertising partners who help us make our internet service and the JUNIQE website more interesting for you. Therefore, we also store cookies from partner organisations on your hard drive. These are temporary cookies that delete themselves automatically after a given period of time. Cookies from partner organisations are mostly deleted after a few days or within 24 months, and, in individual cases, after several years. The cookies from our partner organisations do not contain any personally-identifying data. Data is only collected under a user ID which at no point will be combined with personally-identifying data about you. You can object to data collection and storage for the purposes of web analysis at any time with future effect by letting us know with an email to service@juniqe.com
Google Analytics with the extension “anonymize IP”
This website uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service provided by Google Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses “cookies”. The information on your use of this website generated by the cookie (including your IP address) will be transferred to and stored on a Google server in the USA. Google adheres to the “EU-US privacy shield” framework for transatlantic exchanges of personal data. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports about website activities for us, and to provide other services related to website and internet use.
Google may also transfer this information to third parties as required by law or if said third parties process this data on behalf of Google. In any event, Google will not associate your IP address with other data held by Google. You can prevent these cookies being stored by selecting the appropriate settings in your browser; however, we wish to point out that doing so may mean you will not be able to enjoy the full functionality of this website.
If you do not wish information about your website usage to be passed to Google Analytics, you can prevent this by installing a deactivation add-on for your browser. The current link for this plugin is: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en.
In addition, JUNIQE uses the following Google Analytics advertising functions: Adwords, retargeting, reports on impressions on the Google Display Network, and reports on performance according to demographic characteristics and interests.
If you wish to deactivate Google Analytics’ advertising functions, follow this link for Google’s privacy policy on advertising: https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads. Alternatively, you can also visit the deactivation page on the Network Advertising Initiative’s (NAI) website and follow their instructions and explanations: http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/
Use of Facebook plugins
Our website uses social plugins (“plugins”) provided by the social network Facebook. These services are provided by Facebook Inc. 1601 Willow Road, Menlo Park, California, 94025, USA (“Facebook”). You can find an overview of these plugins and their appearance here:
https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins
When you visit one of our pages, these plugins establish a direct connection between your browser and Facebook’s servers. The contents of the plugin are communicated directly to your browser and integrated into the webpage. By integrating plugins, Facebook receives the information that your browser has visited the respective page of our website, even if you do not have a profile on the social network or are not currently logged in. This information (including your IP address) is transferred directly to Facebook’s servers and stored there.
If you are logged into Facebook, the platform can match your visit to our website with your Facebook profile. When you interact with plugins, for example by clicking on the “like” button, the corresponding information will also be transmitted to Facebook’s servers and stored there. In addition, this information will be published on the social network and shown to your contacts there. For the purpose and scope of this data collection, information on further processing and usage of data by Facebook, and your legal rights and privacy settings relating to this, please refer to Facebook’s privacy policy: https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/update
If you do not wish for Facebook to match data collected through visiting our website to your Facebook profile, you must log out of the network before visiting our website. You can also completely prevent these plugins from loading with add-ons for your browser, for example with the script blocker “NoScript” (http://noscript.net/).
Re-targeting
Our website uses a so-called re-targeting technology to make your online experience more interesting. This makes it possible to reach internet users who are already interested in our shop and products on other websites through adverts. We believe that personalised, interest-related ads are generally more interesting for internet users. The insertion of these ads on the websites of our partners works through cookies and by analysing previous user behaviour. This form of advertising is completely anonymous. No personalised data will be saved, and a user profile will not be merged with your personalised data.
Criteo
This website uses the Criteo service of Criteo SA, Rue Blanche, 75009 Paris, France (http://www.criteo.com/). Via this service, users who have already visited our website once and have shown interest in our offers are shown specific advertisements on this website and on internet pages which also use the Criteo service. The insertion of these ads is based on information about your visits to these respective internet pages, which are, among other things, saved in cookies on your computer. These text files are read within the context of subsequent website visits for specific product recommendations.
For this purpose, a randomly generated identification number is saved in your cookies. Neither this number nor information about your visits to these sites can be attributed to you personally. Under no circumstances will this data be used to personally identify you as the visitor of our website. You can prevent this information from being saved and used by the Criteo service by clicking the following link (https://www.criteo.com/privacy/) and by setting the “Opt-Out” button to “on”. By selecting “on”, a new opt-out cookie will be stored in your browser. This cookie tells Criteo’s service to no longer collect and process data about your user behaviour. You can reactivate this function by setting the opt-out button to “off” again. Please note that this setting must be adjusted for each browser you use. Alternatively, you can select the option "opt-out of all linked browsers" directly below Criteo's opt-out button. If all the cookies in your browser are deleted, the opt-out cookie will be deleted as well.
Snowplow Analytics
We use a web-tracking solution by Snowplow Analytics Limited, 32-38 Scrutton Street, London, UK (“Snowplow”). We use data collected by Snowplow exclusively for statistical purposes. In addition to this, we store a cookie in your browser in order to recognise returning users as such. The Snowplow cookie contains a date and a non-traceable, random combination number (“hash”), as well as the number of the current session.
Each time a page is requested, the following data is transmitted to and stored by Snowplow:

Integration of the Trusted Shops Trustbadge
We have integrated the Trusted Shops Trustbadge on this website in order to display our Trusted Shops Trustmark and offer Trusted Shops products to customers after placing an order.

The Trustbadge and the advertised trust badge services are offered by Trusted Shops GmbH, Subbelrather Str. 15C, 50823 Cologne, Germany.
With every use of the Trustbadge, the web server automatically saves a so-called server log file which contains e.g. your IP address, the date and time of the request, the volume of data transferred and the requesting provider (access data), and documents the request. Those access data are not analysed and are automatically overwritten no later than seven days after the end of your website visit.
Other personal data are transferred to Trusted Shops only if you decide to use or have already registered to use Trusted Shops products after placing an order. In such a case, the contract concluded between you and Trusted Shops applies.
