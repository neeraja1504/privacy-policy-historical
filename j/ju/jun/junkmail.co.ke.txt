Use of Cookies
The Junk Mail Kenya web site uses "cookies" to help you personalise your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalise Junk Mail Kenya pages, or register with the Junk Mail Kenya site or services, a cookie helps Junk Mail Kenya to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as contact numbers, your region and so on. When you return to the same Junk Mail Kenya Web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Junk Mail Kenya features that you have customised.
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Junk Mail Kenya services or other Web sites you visit.
Security of your Personal Information
Junk Mail Kenya secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Junk Mail Kenya secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other Web sites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
Third Party Cookies
Junk Mail Kenya use both our own (first party) and partner companies’ (third party) cookies to support these activities.
