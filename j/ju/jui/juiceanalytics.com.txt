Information We Collect
We collect information, including personal data, to provide better services to all our Users. We use the term “Personal Data” to refer to any information that identifies or can be used to identify you. Common examples of personal data include: full name, home address, email address, date of birth, digital identity, such as a login name or handle, information about your device, and certain metadata.
“Sensitive Personal Data” refers to a smaller subset of personal data which is considered more sensitive to the individual, such as race and ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade-union membership, genetic or biometric information, physical or mental health information, medical insurance data, or sexual orientation. Juice does not collect or use Sensitive Personal Data and asks that you do not provide Sensitive Personal Data to us.
We collect Personal Data in the following ways:
1.     Information You Give to Us
You may choose to provide us with personal data about yourself, including your name, email, phone number, by completing forms on our website, such as when you request information about our Services, or purchase a product. For example, visitors who sign up for an account at http://www.juiceboxdata.com/ provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Juice Inc. – by purchasing access to the jucieboxdata.com paid services, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions.
When using our Services, you may provide us with messages sent between those individuals you have authorized to use our Services. In some instances, you may elect to provide us with location and address information.

You may provide personal data to us when you post information in these interactive and social features. Please note that your postings in these areas of the Sites may be publicly accessible or accessible to other users.
Please note that if you do not provide us with Personal Data, your ability to use certain aspects of our products and services may be limited.
2.     Uploaded Data
When using our Services, you may provide us with data for analytic or visualization services. Although Juice Inc. manages the data storage and databases and maintains all rights to Juice Inc. applications, users retain all rights to their data.

Users may give specific permission to allow Juice Inc. to use uploaded data internally to improve the quality of our services. If the user opts in to Juice data usage, we restrict access to this data to Juice employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.
3.     Information We Obtain from Your Use of Our Services

Web Beacons. Pages of our services or our e-mails may contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags and single-pixel gifs) that permit us, for example, to count users who have visited those pages or opened an e-mail and for other related website statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain website content and verifying system and server integrity).
Clickstream Data. Clickstream data is information collected by our computers when you request Web pages from the Sites. Clickstream data may include information such as the page served, the time spent viewing the page, source of the request, type of browser making the request, the preceding page viewed and similar information. Clickstream data permits us to analyze how visitors arrive at the Sites, what type of content is popular, what type of visitors in the aggregate are interested in particular kinds of content on the Sites.

We can then develop statistics that help us understand how our visitors use our Site and how to improve it.  We may also use the information we obtain about you in other ways for which we provide specific notice at the time of collection.
We will ask for your consent before using information for a purpose other than those set out in this Privacy Policy.
Our Legal Basis for Collecting Personal Data
Whenever we collect Personal Data from you, we may do so on the following legal bases:
1.     Your consent to such collection and use;
2.     Out of necessity for the performance of an agreement between us and you, such as your agreement to use our Services or your request for Products;
3.     Our legitimate business interest, including but not limited to the following circumstances where collecting or using Personal Data is necessary for:
·       Intra-organization transfers of data for administrative purposes;
·       Product development and enhancement, where the processing enables Juice to enhance, modify, personalize, or otherwise improve our services and communications for the benefit of our users, and to better understand how people interact with our Sites;
·       Communications and marketing, including processing data for direct marketing purposes, and subject to your opt-in for these purposes, and to determine the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns and advertising;
·       Fraud detection and prevention;
·       Enhancement of our cybersecurity, including improving the security of our network and information systems; and
·       General business operations and diligence;
Provided that, in each circumstance, we will weigh the necessity of our processing for the purpose against your privacy and confidentiality interests, including taking into account your reasonable expectations, the impact of processing, and any safeguards which are or could be put in place. In all circumstances, we will limit such processing for our legitimate business interest to what is necessary for its purposes.
Information We Share
We do not share personal information with companies, organizations and individuals outside of the Organization unless one of the following circumstances applies:
·       With your consent.  We will share personal data with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Juice when we have your consent to do so.

·       Your account administrators.  We share personal information with account administrators who can configure and manage your account on behalf of you and your organization.
·       For external processing.  We provide personal information to our affiliates or other trusted businesses or partners to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. These third parties include payment processors, such as financial institutions and their vendors and contractors that process transactions, customer relations management vendors, marketing and communications vendors, data storage vendor, cloud services, and similar third parties. It is our policy to only share Personal Data with contractors, service providers and other third parties who are bound by contractual obligations to keep Personal Data confidential and use it only for the purposes for which we disclose it to them.  Under certain circumstances, you may avoid having us share your information with our business partners and vendors by not granting us permission to share your information.  Not granting us permission to share your information with our business partners or vendors may limit your access to their services through the Sites. We do not share personal information with third parties for their own marketing purposes.
·       For Legal Reasons. We will share Personal Data with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Juice if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
o  meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request.
o  enforce applicable Terms of Use, including investigation of potential violations.
o  detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.
o  protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Juice, our Users or the public as required or permitted by law.
We attempt to notify Users about legal demands for their personal data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand.
·       Business Transfers. If we establish a new related entity, are acquired by or merged with another organization, or if substantially all of our assets are transferred to another organization, Personal Data about our users is often a transferred business asset.  In the event that Juice itself or substantially all of our assets are acquired, Personal Data about our users may be one of the transferred assets.

Third Party Links
The Sites may contain links to webpages operated by parties other than Juice. We do not control such websites and are not responsible for their contents or the privacy policies or other practices of such websites. Our inclusion of links to such websites does not imply any endorsement of the material on such websites or any association with their operators. Further, it is up to the User to take precautions to ensure that whatever links the User selects or software the User downloads (whether from this Site or other websites) is free of such items as viruses, worms, trojan horses, defects and other items of a destructive nature. These websites and services may have their own privacy policies, which the User will be subject to upon linking to the third party's website. Juice strongly recommends that each User review the third party's terms and policies.
International Transfer
We are committed to complying with applicable laws, regulations and mandatory government standards regarding the protection of Personal Data.
Since we area global organization, Personal Data and any additional information submitted may be used globally in connection with employment, business processes within Juice,or communicating with ourclients. Therefore, Personal Data may be transferred to other Juice entities worldwide, where it will be processed in accordance with this Privacy Policy and laws that are applicable in each country. Countries where we process data may have laws which are different, and potentially not as protective, as the laws of your own country.
If we transfer your Personal Data out of your jurisdiction, we will implement suitable safeguards and rely on legally-provided mechanisms to lawfully transfer data across borders to ensure that your Personal Data is protected.  We are certified to the EU-US Privacy Shield and it is our policy to, where required by applicable laws, execute a data privacy and data security addendum with all third parties with whom we may share Personal Data.
·      EU-U.S. Privacy Shield
Juice complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union and the United Kingdom to the United States, respectively. Juice has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability. Juice applies the Privacy Shield Principles to all EU data received under the Privacy Shield. If there is any conflict between the policies in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/
In compliance with the US-EU Privacy Shield Principles, Juice commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information. European Union individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding this privacy policy should first contact Juice at: privacy@juiceanalytics.com.
Juice has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the EU-US Privacy Shield Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD, operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers/ for more information and to file a complaint.
Our organization is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Under certain conditions, an individual can invoke binding arbitration. We will disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including meeting national security or law enforcement requirements. In addition, our organization retains liability in cases of onward transfers to third parties.
**How We Protect Personal Data  **
Juice maintains administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect the User's Personal Data and information against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use. We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, taking into account technological reality, cost, the scope, context and purposes of processing weighted against the severity and likelihood that the processing could threaten individual rights and freedoms. For example, restrict access to personal information to Juice Inc. employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations. We use commercially reasonable security measures such as encryption, firewalls, and Secure Socket Layer software (SSL) or hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) to protect Personal Data.
If Juice collects account information for payment or credit, Juice will use the information only to complete the task for which the account information was offered.
Children
The Site is not intended for use by children.  We do not intentionally gather Personal Data about visitors who are under the age of 18.  If a child has provided us with Personal Data, a parent or guardian of that child may contact us to have the information deleted from our records. If you believe that we might have any information from a child under age 18, please contact us at privacy@juiceanalytics.com. If we learn that we have inadvertently collected the personal information of a child under 18, or equivalent minimum age depending on jurisdiction, we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible.
Direct Marketing and “Do Not Track” Signals
California residents are entitled to contact us to request information about whether we have disclosed personal information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.  We do not disclose personal information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. California users may request further information about our compliance with this law by e-mailing us at the address listed in the “How to Contact Us” section.
Juice does not track its users over time and across third party websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals. However, some third party sites do keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you. If you are visiting such sites, your browser may include controls to block and delete cookies, web beacons and similar technologies, to allow you to opt out of data collection through those technologies.
Changes to this Privacy Policy
Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. We will post any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services or programs, email notification or privacy policy changes). We will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review.
