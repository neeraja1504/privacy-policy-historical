Welcome to JuicyCouture.com ("juicycouture.com," the "Site," "we" or "us").
In order to ensure that your experience on the Site is as enjoyable as possible and so that we can focus on doing what we do best, we may partner with trusted companies who specialize in technical things like online order fulfillment and web design. We have partnered with an eCommerce service provider to operate this Site pursuant to certain agreements with us.

Accordingly, we take all commercially practicable and available precautions to ensure the security and confidentiality of that information. We also want you to know what information we collect, why and how we will treat it once collected.

What Information Is Collected?
While not necessarily personally identifiable, we may collect and store information that you provide to us via the Site or that you provide to our Customer Service Department, as further described below.
1. Personal Data
In order to purchase any merchandise from the Site, you may check out as a Guest or register by creating an account. To create an account, you must provide a current email address and a password of your choosing. Regardless of whether you register by creating an account, check out as a Guest or if you merely browse the Site, we may request information about you in certain circumstances and collect certain information automatically (see immediately below). The Personal Data we may collect includes, without limitation, your name, billing address, shipping address, email address, telephone number, credit card number and expiration date. This information is used to provide the products and services that you have ordered or requested, to process and ship orders, to send order and shipping confirmations (or other transactional information) and/or to provide customer service. This information also may be used to contact you about sales, special offers and new site features. We also may obtain, collect and aggregate information (including Personal Data) provided to us by our marketing service providers and other vendors. That information may include information on current subscribers or customers, and is used for a number of things including enabling us to send you the most relevant, timely and exciting offers and announcements specifically tailored for you and your interests. Of course, you can update your information or change your preferences regarding receiving announcements and other information from us at any time by accessing your account via the Site. (For more information, see below section entitled How Can I Access, Correct and Update My Personal Information?)
2. Non-Personal Data
You do not need to create an account with us to use the Site. When you use the Site, including by browsing our merchandise and/or contacting us with inquiries, we collect certain non-identifiable information ("Non-Personal Data"). The Non-Personal Data we collect includes, without limitation, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, Internet browser information, other characteristics of your device and software, domain names of your Internet Service Provider (ISP), your approximate geographic location, a record of your usage of the Services, the time of your usage and aggregated Personal Data that cannot be used to specifically identify you. Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies, cannot, in and of itself, be used to specifically identify you. This information is used to analyze and to improve this Site and to provide our customers with a fulfilling shopping experience. We also may receive certain Non-Personal Data (including, without limitation, of the types set forth above) from various third parties. The Non-Personal Data we receive from third parties may be combined with the information we collect as specified herein.
Cookies and Other Session Identifiers:
Like many sites, we utilize a technology called "cookies". A cookie is a piece of information that is placed on your browser when you access the Site. In many cases, the information collected using cookies (and related technologies) are used in non-identifiable ways, without any reference to Personal Data. For example, we use information we collect about Site users to optimize our Site and to understand traffic and usage patterns. In other cases, we associate the information we collect using cookies and related technologies with Personal Data. In that case, this Privacy Policy governs how we use that information. Additionally, if the settings on your location-aware device allow us to receive geo-location data or information, we may collect that information automatically.
Cookies help provide additional functionality to the Site and help us analyze Site usage more accurately. For instance, the Site may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Site during future visits. We use cookies to monitor and to maintain information about your use of the site. Cookies are also used to track the identity of the Web site you visited immediately prior to visiting this Site; other than that, we do not track information about your use of other Web sites. Cookies also allow us to hold selections in a shopping cart when a user leaves the Site without checking out. Cookies are not used on the Site to store your account information as this information is stored securely on the Site's server. When you log in at the Site with your username and password, we will assign you a secure session id. The server then passes your information to you through this secure session id. Cookies may be session cookies (i.e., last only for one browser session) or persistent cookies (i.e., continue in your browser until they are deleted or expire).
While we recommend that you leave cookies turned on as they allow you to take advantage of some of the features of the Site, you have the ability to control the use and moderation of our cookies. However, if you elect not to allow cookies to be placed as provided herein, you may not be able to use or to enjoy all of the services and features of the Site. Specifically, you can configure the settings (i) to receive notifications when you are receiving new cookies, (ii) to disable cookies or (iii) to delete cookies. Please refer to your web browser's help section for information on how to do this.
Aggregated Personal Data: In an ongoing effort to better understand and to serve the users of the Site, we (either directly or working in concert with our marketing services providers) may conduct research on our customer demographics, interests and behavior based on Personal Data and other information that has been provided or received by us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis and this aggregate information does not identify you personally and is classified and treated as Non-Personal Data under this Privacy Policy.
Other Sites, Including Social Media Platforms:
If you use a social media platform or your mobile device (or other method of communication) to interact with the Site, that platform or application may have a specific privacy statement that governs the use of Personal Data related to it. For example, if you use a mobile application and your mobile device's settings allow it, we may collect Mobile Location Information from your device. Our application may be designed to collect information even if you are not logged into the application or the Site. If you have questions about the security and privacy settings of your mobile device, please refer to instructions from your mobile service provider or the manufacturer of your device to learn how to adjust your settings.
How Can I Access, Correct and Update My Personal Information?
You can access, correct and/or update certain personal information that you have provided to us by clicking on "Update Account" within the "My Account" area of the Site.

Business Transfers: As with any business, it is possible that as our business develops, we might sell, buy, transfer or otherwise acquire or dispose of certain businesses or corporate assets. In the event of such or similar event, Personal Data may be part of the transferred assets. You acknowledge and agree that any successor to or acquirer of us and/or our eCommerce service provider will continue to have the right to use your Personal Data and other information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. We will ensure that any successor or acquirer will treat your Personal Data as securely and confidentially as we do.
Subsidiaries and Affiliates: We may also share your Personal Data with our subsidiaries and/or affiliates consistent with this Privacy Policy. Our subsidiaries and affiliates will be bound to treat and to maintain any Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties: As noted above with respect to our eCommerce service provider, we, like many businesses, sometimes engage other companies to perform certain business-related functions on our behalf so that we can focus on our core business. Examples of these services include payment processing and authorization, fraud protection and credit risk reduction, product customization, order fulfillment and shipping, marketing and promotional material distribution, Web site evaluation, data analysis and, where applicable, data cleansing. In connection with services those partners provide for us, we may provide or otherwise give them access to certain Personal Data, but we authorize them to use this information only in connection with the services they are retained to perform. We employ a thorough vetting process to ensure that our partners adhere to exacting data security and privacy standards. We may also share such information with other marketers whose products or services we feel may be of interest to you. If you prefer we do not share your PII with others, please email us at optout@juicycouture.com.
Legal Requirements: We may disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law (including, without limitation responding to a subpoena or request from law enforcement, court or government agency) or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary (i) to comply with a legal obligation, (ii) to protect or defend our rights, interests or property or that of other customers or users, (iii) to act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Site or the public or (iv) to protect against legal liability as determined in our discretion.
Other uses: If we intend to use any Personal Data in any manner that is not specified herein, we will inform you of such anticipated use prior to or at the time at which the Personal Data is collected or we will obtain your consent subsequent to such collection but prior to such use. In short, we will honor the choices you've made regarding your Personal Data and will inform you about any other intended uses of such information.
2. Non-Personal Data
As noted above, Non-Personal Data does not and cannot be used to personally identify you. We may use such information for any lawful purpose, including sharing non-personal information with our marketing partners, advertisers and others from time to time. Examples of such non-personal information include the number of users who visited the Site during a specific time period or purchased a specific product through the Site. This information generally is shared in an aggregated form.
What Steps Are Taken To Keep My Information Secure?
We have implemented information security measures that contain administrative, technical and physical controls that are designed to reasonably safeguard Personal and Non-personal Data. Even though we have taken and will continue to take significant steps to protect this information, no company, including us, can fully eliminate all security risks associated with PII.
We use various security measures, including Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology, to protect information collected, transferred and retained. If you elect to set up an account on the Site, you will be asked to provide an email address and password. You must provide a valid email address and password in order to create and maintain an account, as well as to access account information. We recommend you select a password with at least 8 characters and consider adding a number or a special character to further strengthen your password. In order to help protect your personal information, you should be careful about providing your password to others and change it periodically. If you wish to update a password, or if you become aware of any loss, theft or unauthorized use of a password, please contact us at privacy@juicycouture.com.
Please be aware that we may store Personal Data or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by our affiliates, agents or third party service providers. We take all commercially reasonable steps to protect the security and confidentiality of all Personal Data provided via the Site from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, inadvertent disclosure, alteration and/or destruction. However, no Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error free. In particular, email sent to or from the Site may not always be secure. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any Personal Data via the Internet or by email.
We do not and will not, at any time, request your Personal Data or other personal information in a non-secure or unsolicited email or telephone communication. Identity theft and the practice currently known as "phishing" are of great concern to us. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is one of our priorities. For more information about phishing, visit the Federal Trade Commission at http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0003-phishing

What Happens When I Link To or From Another Web Site?
The Site may contain links to other websites not operated or controlled by us (the "Third Party Sites"). The policies and procedures set forth herein do not apply to any Third Party Site. The owners and operators of all Third Party Sites are responsible for all Personal Data and Non-personal Data provided, collected, maintained, stored or otherwise disclosed on those sites, if any. The links on the Site do not imply that we endorse or have reviewed the Third Party Sites, including their privacy policies, if any.

If you are under the age of 13, you should not provide any Personal Data to us and you should use this Site only with the knowledge, permission and involvement of a parent or guardian.
