Privacy Policy | Just A Pinch
Hello, hello! We have tried to make our Privacy Policy as detailed as possible so that you know exactly how your information will be used. When it comes down to it, though, our policy is a simple one: We pledge to respect your privacy as a member of this club. The recipe club is meant to be a home-away-from-home for you while you’re online and we intend to be good neighbors!
Our legal friends aren’t fans of simplicity, though, and have asked that we “fancify” our philosophy a bit by adding in a few extra words. Please take a moment to read our handiwork below! You can also find additional information on the terms of Club membership by reviewing the Terms of Use.
Except as explicitly provided herein, this Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Just A Pinch Recipe Club® does not own or control, or to people that Just A Pinch Recipe Club® does not employ or manage. This Privacy Policy may change from time to time so please check back periodically. The current version of this Privacy Policy is dated May 25, 2018.
Any dispute over privacy is subject to this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use. Please note that the use of information that we gather is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time of use. You should check this Site frequently to see recent changes in this Site’s Privacy Policy and its Terms of Use.
