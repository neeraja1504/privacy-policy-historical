Privacy Policy
Updated 2018
Welcome to JustLuxe. We own and operate JustLuxe.com, and protecting your information is of singular importance for our website. Read this Privacy Policy and the accompanying Terms of Service carefully before interacting with us in any significant manner, i.e., giving your information to us, using our services, interacting with our content or utilizing any of our offerings via our Websites. Interaction with our sites provides JustLuxe.com with an implied consent of your agreement to and acceptance of the policies and practices described herein.
What Information We Obtain
Certain interactions or functions on our Websites may request users to disclose personal information, sometimes known as PII or personally identifiable information, to be included on our electronic email or postal mailing lists, make reservations, request information on our products or services, as well as our subscription services.
To help you with some of these types of interactions via our Websites, JustLuxe may request additional types of information from you on a voluntary basis. If such information is shared with us, we won’t share specifically identifiable information of our users but may share generalized, aggregate data or so called “demographic information.” Supplying such information is optional and if you choose not to enter such information, you may still use many of these applications. If we share demographic information with third parties, we will only provide demographic data that has been aggregated.
Our Website and mobile applications may use forms for you to give us contact information (including your name, address, telephone number, and email address) so you can place orders, request information, customer support, and even interact with 3rd parties. For certain services, we may also request a credit card number, identification number, or other financial information or PII.
We receive and store any information you enter on our Websites, mobile application, or give us in any other way, including through email, telephone, or other communications with our customer service department. If you contact us for support, we may keep an internal record of what support was given.
We use your information to contact you regarding functionality changes to our products, our Websites and mobile application, newly offered JustLuxe.com services, and special offers we think you'll find valuable. If you would rather not receive this information, you’ll be able to Unsubscribe or change your preferences.
We may also use your information to present a co-branded offer with our partners or affiliates. If we collect information from you in connection with a co-branded offer, it will be clear at the point of interaction which group is collecting the information and whose privacy statement applies for that particular engagement, whether JustLuxe or our 3rd party partners.
