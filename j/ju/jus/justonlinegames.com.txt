- A description of types of data that are collected for OBA and/or multi-site advertising purposes on each of your websites by you and any third parties;
- An explanation of how, and for what purpose, that data will be used or transferred to third parties; and
- A conspicuous link to the OBA choice mechanism (e.g., opt-out link) provided by the NAI member, and/or a conspicuous link to the opt-out page on the NAI's consumer website.
