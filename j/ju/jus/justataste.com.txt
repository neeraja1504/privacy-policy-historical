On the basis of our legitimate interest , we and our third-party partners, may combine the data we collect from you over time from our websites, products and services with data obtained from other sources. We combine your data with other sources to improve user experience on our websites and services we provide. In some instances, Just A Taste and the third-parties we engage may automatically collect data through cookies, web logs and other similar applications. This data is used to better understand and improve the usability, performance, and effectiveness of our websites, products and services to help tailor content or offers for you. Please reference the “Tracking Technologies, Cookies & Do-Not-Track” section below for more information.
On the basis of legitimate interest , we process Personal Data for network and information security purposes. Pursuant to Recital (49) of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“ GDPR ”), organizations have a recognized legitimate interest in collecting and processing Personal Data to the extent strictly necessary and proportionate for the purposes of ensuring network and information security. According to said Recital (49), network and information security means the ability of a network or of an information system to resist events, attacks or unlawful or malicious actions that could compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of stored or transmitted data, or the security of the related services offered by, or accessible via those networks and systems.
Both as an organization in our own right, and as a provider of food related services, it is in our legitimate interests as well as in our users’ interest, as laid down in Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR, to collect and process Personal Data to the extent strictly necessary and proportionate for the purposes of ensuring the security of our own, and of our users’ networks and information systems. This includes the development of threat intelligence resources aimed at maintaining and improving on an ongoing basis the ability of networks and systems to resist unlawful or malicious actions and other harmful events (“ cyber-threats ”). The Personal Data we process for said purposes includes, without limitation, network traffic data related to cyber-threats such as:
sender email addresses (e.g., of sources of SPAM);
recipient email addresses (e.g., of victims of targeted email cyberattacks);
reply-to email addresses (e.g., as configured by cybercriminals sending malicious email);
filenames and execution paths (e.g., of malicious or otherwise harmful executable files attached to emails);
URLs and associated page titles (e.g., of web pages broadcasting or hosting malicious or otherwise harmful contents); and/or
IP addresses (e.g., of web servers and connected devices involved in the generation, distribution, conveyance, hosting, caching or other storage of cyber-threats such as malicious or otherwise harmful contents).
Depending on the context in which such data is collected, it may contain Personal Data concerning you or any other data subjects. However, in such cases, we will process the data concerned only to the extent strictly necessary and proportionate to the purposes of detecting, blocking, reporting (by removing any personally identifiable elements) and mitigating the cyber-threats of concern to you, and to all organizations relying on our products and services to secure their networks and systems. When processing Personal Data in this context, we will not seek to identify a data subject unless strictly indispensable to the remediation of the cyber-threats concerned, or required by law.
If you believe that your Personal Data was unduly collected or is unduly processed by Just A Taste for such purposes, please refer to the “Your Rights” and “Contact Us” sections below. Please be aware that if it is determined that Personal Data concerning you is processed by Just A Taste because it is necessary for the detection, blocking, or mitigation of convicted cyber-threats, in line with GDPR Article 21(1), objection, rectification, or erasure requests may be rejected. It is our compelling legitimate interests to protect our organization and our users from cyber threats, and therefore our interest may override your objection, rectification, or erasure requests until you demonstrate the measures necessary to dissociate your Personal Data from any identified cyber-threat.
Marketing and Community Networking
Just a Taste has a legitimate interest in promoting our commercial offerings and to optimize the delivery of communications to that effect to our users and audiences that are most likely to find them relevant. We will therefore collect and process data to that end as explained below. However, where we are legally required to obtain your consent to provide you with certain marketing materials, we will only provide you with such marketing materials where we have obtained such consent from you. If you do not want to continue receiving any marketing materials from us, you can click on the unsubscribe function in the communication or e-mail, or you can contact us directly and request that you no longer wish to receive such marketing materials from us.
Messages
In addition to the purposes described above, we may, in compliance with applicable legal requirements, use your Personal Data to provide you with advertisements, promotions, and information about products and services tailored to you and your needs. This may include demographic data or trend data provided by third-parties, where permitted. Contact details, including phone numbers, mail, and email addresses, may be used to contact you. If you do not want us to use your Personal Data in this way, you can simply choose not to consent to such use of your data on the webpages and/or forms through which such Personal Data is collected. You can also exercise this right at any time by contacting us directly as explained below.
Interest-Based Ads
We may provide your data including the data about your interests in our products or services to Third-Parties for the purposes of serving you more relevant ads. Where we provide you with interest-based ads on a site other than our own, we do not track your other activities on that site. If you click on the ads on our websites, we will know only the domain you came from. For more information, please see the “Tracking Technologies, Cookies & Do Not Track” section below.
Data from Third-Parties
Third-parties may provide us with Personal Data they have collected about you from you or from further online and offline sources, such as marketing data from our partners and third-parties that is combined with information we already have about you, to provide you with more relevant communications and better tailored offers or services. We make reasonable efforts to verify that the third-parties we engage for such purposes are reputable and law-abiding and we will not solicit them to disclose to us Personal Data we do not have a lawful purpose to collect and process. However, we are not liable for any processing of your Personal Data by such third-parties prior to, during, or after they provide it to us. We may combine such Personal Data with the Personal Data we already have about you to provide you with a better experience, evaluate your interest in our products or services, or improve the quality of our offerings.
Just a Taste Community (Forums, Blogs, and Networking Sites)
We operate forums, websites, and related information services, in order to better assist you in using our products and services, receive feedback and comments on certain recipes, discussing technical issues, and sharing your experiences. You should be aware that any data you provide in these public forums will not be kept confidential, as it may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your Personal Data from any forum, contact us directly as explained below. In certain circumstances, we may not be able to remove your Personal Data, in which case we will let you know why. Your use of these other services may be subject to additional terms and conditions.
Tracking Technologies, Cookies & Do-Not-Track
Cookies
A cookie is a commonly used automated data collection tool. Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or device by websites that you visit or HTML-formatted emails you open, to make websites work, or work more efficiently. We and our partners may use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags, scripts or other similar technologies on our websites or emails to:
Ensure the proper functioning of our websites and the proper delivery of legitimate electronic communications;
Tailor information presented to you based on your browsing preferences, such as language and geographical region;
Collect statistics regarding your website usage;
Provide us with business and marketing information; and
In some cases, to enable a third-party to deliver future advertising for our products and services to you when you visit certain websites owned by third-parties.
We use different kinds of cookies:
Essential cookies  are necessary to provide you with services and features available through our websites. Without these cookies, services you may need, such as viewing recipes, receiving newsletters, etc., cannot be provided.
Analytics or customization cookies  collect data that is either used in aggregate form to help us understand how the website is being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize the website for you. For instance, we utilize Google Analytics in order to track things such as: website statistics, user demographics, interests and behavior on our websites, browser, browser language, type of operating system, domain name of Internet Service Provider, device IP address web pages visited, and the times and dates of visits.
Advertising cookies and tracking scripts  are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you. They perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly delivered and, in some cases, featuring ads based on your interests.
We use local storage, such as HTML5, to store content data and preferences. Third-parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our website or to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity also use HTML5 to collect and store data. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 content.
If you do not wish to receive cookies, you may be able to refuse them by not agreeing to the use of them upon entering the website. If you do so, we may be unable to offer you some of our functionalities, services, or support. If you have previously visited our websites, you may also have to delete any existing cookies from your browser.
Do-Not-Track
There are different ways you can prevent tracking of your online activity. One of them is setting a preference in your browser that alerts websites you visit that you do not want them to collect certain data about you. This is referred to as a Do-Not-Track (“ DNT ”) signal. Please note that our websites may not recognize or act in response to DNT signals from web browsers. There is currently no universally-accepted standard for what a company should do when a DNT signal is detected. In the event a final standard is established, we will assess how to appropriately respond to these signals. For more detailed information about cookies, Do-Not-Track and other tracking technologies, please visit www.allaboutcookies.org and https://allaboutdnt.com.
Third-Party Data Collection
Cookies may also be placed by third-parties to deliver tailored information and content which may be of interest to you, such as promotions or offerings, when you visit third-party websites after you have left our websites. We do not permit these third-parties to collect Personal Data about you beyond such cookies (e.g., email address) on our site.
Social Media Features and Widgets
Our websites include social media features, such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram and Snapchat and their widgets, such as the “Share” feature found on such social media sites. These features are usually recognizable by their third-party brand or logo and may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our websites, and set a cookie to enable the feature to work properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third-party or hosted directly on our site. Your interactions with any such third-party feature is governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.
How to Opt out of Interest-based Advertising
We partner with third-parties to display advertising on our website or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third-party partners may use cookies or similar technologies to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. Please contact us if you wish to opt out of interest-based advertising. However, please note that if you opt out, you will continue to receive generic ads not based on your interests.
