Privacy Policy v3.0 - JustGiving
What Data Do We Collect?
We don’t receive any personal data about you other than what you provide us, either by creating an account, using the Services, from Facebook when you agree to connect your Facebook account to JustGiving, or data we can infer from your use of the Services.
When you create a JustGiving account:  We will collect basic contact information about you to set up your account you so you can make donations or raise funds. This will include your name, address and email address. We will also ask you to register a username and password so you can gain secure access to your account in the future.
Alternatively, you may authorise us to collect your basic personal details from a secure online source (e.g. Google, Facebook, PayPal or a sponsor charity) to which you have already provided this information.
We enable you to set an image for your JustGiving profile and this image is shown as a thumbnail next to all of your actions on the platform, unless you have chosen to hide your name and photo from the public when you donate. Please note that this image is dynamic and not frozen in time—e.g. if you change your image in 2018, the new image will appear next to your activities from 2015.
When you sign in to JustGiving using your Facebook account:  If you choose to login via Facebook, we will obtain access to your Facebook public profile information and email address. We will use this information to allow you to login and populate our records about you. If you give us permission (via Facebook’s preference settings), we may also obtain access to your friend list but we only receive the names of your friends who are also JustGiving users. We will only use this to see if people on your friends list are also using our website and as set out in How we use personal information below. You can control whether or not Facebook shares this data with us, either by changing your preferences when you first login to JustGiving with your Facebook account or by visiting the app setting controls on Facebook’s platform.
When you make a donation:  To enable us to process donations, we will collect basic payment information as well as your name, home address and email address. Your name and the amount you've donated will display on the public page, unless you select the “Hide my name and photo from public view” option when you donate. As well as hiding your details from the public when you donate, you can also change the display name to something else, such as a nickname or your initials.
When you create a Fundraising or Crowdfunding Page:  We will use the details you provided when you set up your account to create your Fundraising Page or JustGiving Crowdfunding Page. We will also collect details of the charity or not-for-profit that you are supporting, or the details for your proposed Crowdfunding Page. Where applicable, we will ask you to provide details of how and when you are intending to fundraise and/or the occasion you are recognising by carrying out the fundraising.
Where you create a Crowdfunding Page, we will also collect your title (if you choose to provide it), date of birth, telephone number and personal bank account details.
When you give us information about others : You may decide to provide us with information about others (or authorise us to collect this information on your behalf from your social networks or your email contacts list) for example:
· so we can help you tell your friends and family about a Crowdfunding Page you are running or charity fundraising you are carrying out; or
· if you start fundraising or crowdfunding for, or in the memory or in celebration of, another person
You must ensure that they have agreed to you providing us with their information. Where required by local laws, we would advise you to keep a record of their agreement and provide them with a copy of, or link to, this Policy. This is especially the case if you provide us with sensitive information about them (e.g. a reference to an illness or health condition).
You should also only contact individuals using the Services who you know would be happy to hear from you and must not use our Services to send unsolicited 'spam' messages.
If you create a Crowdfunding Page for a club, organisation, body or association which is managed by someone other than yourself, you must ensure that the manager(s) of that club, organisation etc. agrees to your fundraising (e.g. you are a member of a sports club and want to raise funds for a new clubhouse - you must seek the agreement of the sports club committee).
When you register your interest to hear about Charity Places for Events : We collect personal information when you register your interest to be informed about Charity Places for an Event. This will include information such as your name and email address.
When you apply for a Charity Place : We collect personal information when you apply for a Charity Place for an Event. This will include your name, email address and any additional questions which help the charity to review your application.
When you use the Services : We also collect information about your use of our Services, including your IP address, mobile device identifier, how much time you spend on the site, and what you do, like or view. We do this through the use of cookies. To read more about our use of cookies, please refer to our separate Cookies page.
