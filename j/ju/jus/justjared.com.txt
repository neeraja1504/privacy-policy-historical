Collection and Use of Information
Personal Information. As used in this Policy, “Personal Information” refers to information that can be used, directly or indirectly, alone or together with other information, to identify a specific individual. A user’s Personal Information includes (without limitation) his or her name, address, telephone number, and email address. Personal Information may also include information about activities or activity level, achievements or other usage statistics or accomplishments, and information about a user’s location, to the extent that the user elects to share any of that information with us, or to provide us with access to any of that information that may be stored on or otherwise available from his or her computer, phone or other device from which he or she accesses or communicates with a Site or any of the Services.
In operating the Sites and the Services, our practice is to collect limited personal information from our users, and only where and to the extent necessary, so that we can deliver to our users the Sites as well as any Services they are interested in using. From time to time, users of the Sites may be given the opportunity to enter or participate in sweepstakes or contests that are promoted from one or more of the Sites, and we may collect Personal Information in connection with those sweepstakes or contests, and then share Personal Information with third parties who are administering those sweepstakes or contests. You should not enter any sweepstakes or contest without first reading the rules applicable to that sweepstake or content to ensure that you understand and agree with how we and/or our business partners may use any Personal Information that you provide. You always have the option not to provide us with any Personal Information, or to limit the Personal Information that you provide us or allow us to access, but you understand that any such restriction or limitation may affect your ability to take advantage of the Sites and all of the Services that we offer.
We may also allow you to connect with certain third-party platforms and social media services (such as LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and other similar services). If you do use the Sites or the Services to connect to a third-party service, please make sure you are familiar with and in agreement with the ways in which that third-party service will share your personal information. Similarly, if you use the Sites or the Services to provide information to those third-party services, the information will no longer be under our control, and will instead be subject to the privacy policies and other terms of use of those third-party services. It is your responsibility to control whether your activities and information from the Sites or our Services are provided to third-party services.
If you do elect to provide Personal Information to us, the Personal Information we collect and store will be used for one or more of the purposes specified below:
• Email Subscriptions and Surveys. The Sites may offer you the option to receive news, updates and promotional information by email, and if you want to be on any such mailing list and receive informational and promotional emails or other regular informational communications from us, you will need to give us an email address to which we can send those communications. From time to time we may ask you to participate in optional surveys, which may ask for other personal information such as your age, gender, occupation or location, but you will always have the option not to provide us with that information.
• Contact Us. We provide our users with a number of ways to contact us, so that they can reach us with their comments and questions. Our Sites may have a “Contact Us” page that includes a contact email address, and may also include a message form that you can complete in order to contact us directly from the website. We also expect to maintain a presence on Twitter, LinkedIn and perhaps Facebook and Instagram, as well as other social media and business networking platforms. If you communicate with us by email, even if you have not previously provided us with your email address, we will use your email address if necessary in order to respond to you, and we may retain your email address in our files during and for a period after the time that we are in communication. We do not control the terms of use or privacy policies for any social media platforms in which we participate, and it will be solely your responsibility to familiarize yourself with their information collection practices and only communicate with us and/or disclose personal information via social media (which will be collected by the third-party social media platform operators, and not by us) if you are in agreement with those information collection practices.
• Other Notices : If you provide us with an email address, we may use that address to let you know about changes to this Policy or to our terms of use, or to contact you about specific Company-related issues or your use of the Sites and the Services generally, or to reply to any support issues or other questions. Any time we send you an email, it will include an unsubscribe link, so that you can request that we do not send you any more emails. If you enable notifications via any Service that allows for notifications, then you will receive those notifications (which may take the form of badges, banners, alerts or any other notice format available on the applicable computing device) that you have authorized the device to provide.
Anonymous Information. “Anonymous Information” is any information or data that is anonymous, aggregated, de-identified, or that otherwise does not reveal your identity. We may collect and use Anonymous Information about our users in any of the following ways:
• Automatic Collection and Analytics : Our servers can automatically recognize visitors’ domain names and IP addresses and may also identify a user’s computer/mobile device type and connection information, as well as information about browser type and browser settings and (where possible) geographic location. We also may use Google analytics to track user traffic to our website. No Personal Information about you is revealed in this data collection and tracking process. We may also use clear gifs (also known as web beacons) and other methods to gather anonymous “traffic data” that does not personally identify you, but that may be helpful for marketing purposes or for improving our Sites or other Services we offer. Clear gifs may also be used in email messages that we send, so that we can track whether recipients have opened those messages.
• Cookies. From time to time, we may use the standard “cookies” feature of major browser applications that allows us to store a small piece of data on your computer about your visit to a Site. We do not set any Personal Information or personally identifiable information in cookies, nor do we employ any data capture mechanisms on the Sites or in the Services other than cookies. Cookies can help us learn which areas of the Sites and which of the Services are useful and which Site areas or Services need improvement. You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings on your browser and/or in your computing device. However, if you choose to disable this function, your experience at the Sites or with the Services may be diminished and some features may not work as they were intended. Promotions or advertisements displayed via the Sites or the Services may also contain cookies, and we do not have access to or control over information collected by outside advertisers when you click on any such promotions or advertisements.
• Security and Bug Tracking. We expect the Sites and Services to include features that will help us track down bugs and crashes; some of these features will include reports that are generated by our users’ devices, and these reports include information about device type, capabilities, and other software running at the time of the crash. You will have the option whether or not to provide this information to us, and it will always be provided to us anonymously. This information will never include Personal Information and never be identifiable by use, and we will use this information for our development, debugging and other quality improvement efforts.
Additional Use and Disclosure of Personal Information/
In addition to the uses and disclosures described above, we may disclose Personal Information if we determine that we are required to do so:
• To comply with applicable laws, or with legal process served on us;
• To protect or defend our rights or the rights of any of our users or business partners;
• To enforce our terms of use or other agreements; or
• To protect anyone’s rights, property or safety (including our own).
In addition, in order to accommodate changes in our business, we may sell our company or portions of the Company or sell or buy portions of other companies or assets, including information we collect through the Sites and the Services. If the Company or its assets should ever be acquired a third party, then we expect that our database of user information (including any Personal Information contained therein) would be one of the assets sold in such a transaction, and we would ask that the buyer notify you of any changes to this Policy after the sale closes.
We may revise this Policy from time to time – e.g., to keep up with changes in the law, or to reflect changes in how we are doing business. The Sites and all Services that are governed by this Policy will always include our most up-to-date privacy policy, and we include an effective date at the top of the Policy, so you can quickly see when we last updated the Policy. Any updates or modifications to this Policy will be effective as soon as we post the updated privacy policy to the Sites or in any of the Services, and it is your responsibility to review this Policy periodically to make sure you continue to be in agreement with all of its terms.
Security of Your Information
We have a variety of security measures in place to maintain the safety of your Personal Information. Any Personal Information you provide will be securely stored and accessible only by our employees and agents who have a need to access that information, who are aware of and required to maintain the confidential nature of that information.
Changes to Your Stored Information
You can notify us at any time that you want to terminate your account with us, or terminate our storage of your Personal Information, and upon receipt of that notice, we will remove all information about you from our database, at which point you will no longer receive email notices and updates from us. Please note that, due to email production schedules and lead times, your account may not be disabled immediately, and you may receive emails that were already in production or scheduled for delivery at the time that you made changes to your email subscriptions or other information. In addition, we will retain information provided to us in connection with any purchase made using the Sites or the Services in order to complete and deliver the purchase, and for our record keeping purposes.
Additional Information
