Privacy Policy – Justuno
Justuno is owned and operated by Justuno, Inc (“Justuno”, “we”, “us”, and/or “our”) and has been created to provide our Site visitors and Customer’s own Site visitors (“you”, “your”) with information about our company and our email collection tools. This Privacy Policy (this “Policy”) sets forth Justuno’s policy with respect to information, including personally identifiable data (“Personal Information”), that is collected from you through the Site or through our other service offerings (collectively, including the Site, the “Services”). Certain Services may be made available to you on websites owned by our end customers (“Justuno Customers”), and the information collected via embedded widgets on those websites (“Tools”) is directed to Justuno and governed by this Policy.
The Services and our business may change from time to time. As a result, at times it may be necessary for Justuno to make changes to this Policy. Justuno reserves the right to update this Policy at any time and from time to time without prior notice. Please review this Policy periodically, and especially before you provide any Personal Information. This Policy was last updated on the date indicated above. Your continued use of the Services after any changes or revisions to this Policy shall indicate your agreement with the terms of such revised Policy.
1. Information Collected
When you interact with us through the Site or other Services, we may collect Personal Information and other information from you, as further described below:
Personal Information You Provide
We collect Personal Information from you when you voluntarily provide such information, such as when you contact us with inquiries, subscribe to our or a Justuno Customer’s email newsletter, register for access to the Services or use certain Services as well as when you register, login or complete a purchase on our or a Justuno Customer’s website. For instance, Justuno may collect the following information about you: name, address, zip code, telephone number and email address. A hashed version of your email address may be sent to third parties for marketing purposes. The information requested and collected from you may vary. For example, Justuno Customers may customize the data that is requested via the Tools and may request and collect other information, such as your favorite color or birthdate. Justuno shall not be responsible for the activities of Justuno Customers. Specifically, Justuno does not control and shall not be responsible in the event a Justuno Customer requests sensitive information from you, such as financial, health, and medical information. Wherever Justuno collects Personal Information we make an effort to provide a link to this Policy.
By voluntarily providing us with Personal Information, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Policy. If you provide Personal Information to the Site or through the other Services, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Information may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of Justuno and the authorized third parties referred to herein located in the United States.
Other Information
Non-Identifiable Data: When you interact with Justuno through the Services, we receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information. Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you, unless it is combined with Personal Information. Justuno may store such information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by Justuno affiliates, agents or service providers. We may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, and the domain names of our visitors’ Internet service providers. It is important to note that Justuno uses no Personal Information in this process.

The cookies may be linked to data you voluntarily submit to us, e.g., your email address, which we may share with a third party. If we share such Personal Information it will be in hashed, non-human readable form for security purposes only.

Accountability For Onward Transfer
In order to provide our services, Justuno utilizes third party agents, both domestically and internationally, to perform tasks on behalf of and under the instruction of Justuno. Personal data, including EU and Swiss personal data, obtained on a consumer may be disclosed from Justuno’s clients to third parties (such as agents, representatives, vendors, and/or subcontractors) for the purpose of performing business-related functions. When we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function. Justuno’s agents, vendors, and/or subcontractors will be contractually obligated 1) to use, protect, and maintain the same level of confidentiality and protection of personal information consistent with this Privacy Policy and, 2) to notify Justuno if they make a determination that they can no longer meet this obligation.

However, no Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error free. In particular, email sent to or from the Site may not be secure. Therefore, you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us via email. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any Personal Information to Justuno via the Internet.
