Privacy Policy | JustHungry
It is our policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating JustHungry.com.
Website Visitors
Like most websites, JustHungry.com collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. JustHungry.com's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how JustHungry.com's visitors use its website. From time to time, JustHungry.com may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
JustHungry.com also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments. JustHungry.com only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
JustHungry.com discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on JustHungry.com's behalf or to provide services available at JustHungry.com's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using JustHungry.com's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. JustHungry.com will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, JustHungry.com discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when JustHungry.com believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of JustHungry.com, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an JustHungry.com website or have subscribed to receive updates from JustHungry.com and have supplied your email address, JustHungry.com may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with JustHungry.com and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. JustHungry.com takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
