SECURITY
Protecting your information is a priority for Justin Alexander Justin Alexander will take reasonable steps to protect the security and integrity of all Personal Information provided to the Justin Alexander Web Properties. For example, we use industry standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to protect the security of your sensitive online transactions. However, due to the inherent nature of the Internet as an open global communications vehicle, we cannot guarantee that information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our system or otherwise in our care, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers. No transmission of data over the Internet is guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be possible for third parties not under the control of Justin Alexander to intercept or access transmissions or private communications unlawfully. While we strive to protect your personal information, Justin Alexander cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. Any such transmission is done at your own risk.
If you  contact us  by e-mail, you should be aware that your transmission might not be secure. A third party could view information you send by these methods in transit.
You may be able to create an account on the Justin Alexander Web Properties with a username and password. If so, you are responsible for maintaining the strict confidentiality of your account password, and you shall be responsible for any access to or use of the Justin Alexander Web Properties by you or any person or entity using your password, whether or not such access or use has been authorized by or on behalf of you, and whether or not such person or entity is your employee or agent. You agree to (a) immediately notify Justin Alexander of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security, and (b) ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each session. It is your sole responsibility to control the dissemination and use of your password, control access to and use of your account, and notify Justin Alexander when you desire to cancel your account on the Justin Alexander Web Properties.

We will have no liability for disclosure of your information due to errors or unauthorized acts of third parties during or after transmission.
In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your Personal Information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development. If a notification is appropriate, we would endeavor to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and, to the extent we have your e-mail address, we may notify you by e-mail. You consent to our use of e-mail as a means of such notification.
PHISHING
With identity theft a continuing problem, it has become increasingly common for unauthorized individuals purporting to represent a legitimate company such as a bank or on-line merchant, to send e-mail messages to consumers requesting that the consumer provide personal, often sensitive information. Sometimes, the domain name of the e-mail address from which the e-mail appears to have been sent, and the domain name of the web site requesting such information, appears to be the domain name of a legitimate, trusted company. In reality, such sensitive information is received by an unauthorized individual to be used for purposes of identity theft. This illegal activity is known as "phishing."
If you receive an e-mail or other correspondence requesting that you provide any sensitive information (including your Justin Alexander Web Properties password or credit/debit card information) via e-mail or to a web site that does not seem to be affiliated with the Justin Alexander Web Properties, or that otherwise seems suspicious to you, please do not provide such information, and report such request to us by calling 1-845-369-6631.
CHILDREN AND PRIVACY
Justin Alexander is concerned about the safety of children when they use the Internet. We encourage parents and guardians to spend time with their children online and to be familiar with the sites their children visit. We will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without prior verifiable parental consent when legally required. If we become aware that a customer is under the age of 13 and has registered without the legally required prior verifiable parental consent, we will remove his or her personally identifiable registration information from our files.
Information posted to message boards, chat areas, club and home pages are available to the general public. Please use caution when posting any such information. Users under the age of 18 should be particularly careful not to provide any personally identifying information while using chat rooms, message boards, or any other public forums. Users of chat areas, message boards, or any other public forums must follow acceptable standards of behavior when posting messages online. Justin Alexander reserves the right to, but is not obligated to, refuse or delete any content that in our sole discretion is considered inappropriate.
