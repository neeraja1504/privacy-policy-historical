Affiliate Links
Jonnyelwyn.co.uk makes use of various affiliate programs which help to support the enormous amount of time needed to research, create and regularly update, the hundreds of posts on this site.
No editorial decisions are ever swayed by the use of affiliate links and it never adds to the cost of a product or service. In some circumstances the affiliate link actually provides a discount.
If you have any questions, just drop them in the box above, I’d be happy to answer them as best I can. Otherwise, thank you for supporting the blog, I hope you’ve found it useful!
As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.
Sponsored Content
I get asked all the time to write about specific brands and products. Very occasionally, I agree to do so if I think the product would be of genuine interest to myself or my readers.
In these instances I ask the company to cover the cost of the time it takes to research, write and update the content. This is what a sponsored post means on my blog.
I retain complete editorial control, I write what I like and I say what I want. That’s the deal.
To provide some context, there are well over 700 posts on this site (and counting) and so far four of them have been sponsored.
If you have any questions, do drop me a note in the form above.
