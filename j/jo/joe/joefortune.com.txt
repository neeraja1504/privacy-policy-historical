In order to provide the info or services you have requested, your identifiable information may be transferred or stored on computer equipment or in offices that are located outside your area, and you are deemed to consent to that.
SECURITY AND PRIVACY
We use all reasonable efforts to safeguard the privacy of your personally identifiable information. However, any transmission of info over the internet cannot be made completely secure. Accordingly, we assume no responsibility or liability for disclosure of any of your information due to errors in transmission, unauthorised third-party access or other causes beyond our reasonable control.
You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of any account ID or password you use to register, and you should always be careful and responsible whenever disclosing info online.
The Website may contain links to other websites that are owned and operated by third parties. The information practices of those other websites are not covered by this Policy.

You should contact these third parties directly with questions about their use of the information that they collect.

If at any time you indicate that you no longer want to receive such email communications, or if you want to change or correct any previously provided information we maintain, you may send such direction to our Customer Support Team.
CORRECTIONS AND UPDATES
Prior to the modification of your personally identifiable info as a security precaution, we may ask to confirm your identity by providing identifying information such as your name, address and/or birth date, government-issued ID or any other documentation we deem necessary. In addition, access to personally identifiable info may be limited or denied where providing such access would be unreasonably burdensome or expensive in the circumstances, or as otherwise permitted by law.
