HOW YOU CAN CONTROL DATA ABOUT YOU
You may choose at any time to remove any of your personal information from any lists we might use to send you marketing communications by contacting us using the contact information provided below.
EMAIL
You can subscribe to receive coupons, promotions, and other product offers (“Promotion Emails”) from us by email by visiting joefresh.com and clicking on ‘subscribe’ within the bottom navigation.

You may still receive emails from us if you elect to unsubscribe, but you will no longer receive Promotion Emails. For example, if you provide your email in order to participate in an optional feature or function of the Website such as a sweepstakes, contest or online offer, even if you opt to unsubscribe from Promotion Emails or change your preferences not to receive any marketing communications, you may still receive emails about the specific sweepstakes, contest or online offer you entered until the sweepstakes, contest or online offer has expired, but you will not receive other emails if you opt to “Unsubscribe”.
If you elect to share content with your friends through tools or features provided through the Web site, you may be required to provide your friends’ email addresses. We will only use this information to send your message and will not retain the information for our own use.

A NOTE ABOUT PRIZE PROMOTIONS
Promotions (such as contests, sweepstakes or giveaways) that are hosted on the Web Site may be sponsored by JFS, may be co-sponsored by JFS and another company, or may be sponsored by companies other than JFS. JFS may also sponsor or co-sponsor promotions hosted by third parties on linked third party web sites. When you enter a promotion hosted or sponsored by JFS and/or our partners, you may be asked to provide registration information, which may include your name, address, and email address, and other information, some of which may be optional, in order to participate. If you voluntarily submit personally identifying information to enter a sweepstakes on the Website, the information that your submit may be used as part of your entry, for sweepstakes administration and prize fulfillment purposes, and/or for future marketing by Sponsor, such as to notify you of a product or promotion that Sponsor thinks may be of interest.
Third parties that host promotions alone or in conjunction with JFS may collect and use your information. Some promotion sites may use Cookies in order to track your progress or number of entries in a promotion. If information is collected and used by a third party in conjunction with a promotion, please review the third party’s Privacy Policy to learn about its information practices.
When you participate in a promotion, you are subject to the Official Rules of that promotion, which may contain additional information about the specific privacy practices associated with that promotion.
THIRD-PARTY LINKS

Any such web sites are wholly independent from our Web Site and we have no control over those web sites and their operators, including their privacy policies and practices. Before providing any of your personal information on any such other web site, you should review their policies on privacy and security.
BUSINESS CHANGES
In the event that JFS experiences a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, bankruptcy, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your information may be among the information transferred.
