Information We Collect and How We Use It
When we need to collect personally identifiable information from you to provide you with a particular service, we will ask you to voluntarily supply us with the information we need. For example, if you would like to make a reservation at one of our hotels, we will ask you for information such as name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card number, Marriott Rewards number (if applicable) and room preference to process your reservation. We will use your email address to send a confirmation and, if necessary, might use the other information to contact you for help in processing the reservation. We will also use your email address to:
1) send you a pre-arrival message summarizing your confirmation details and providing other information about the area and the hotel,
2) notify you about special offers and promotions as described in the email section of this privacy statement,
3) send you copies of your hotel bills when you request them or subscribe to the eFolio feature, as well as
4) send you periodic satisfaction or market research surveys.
You can opt out of marketing emails at any time. You can also opt out of Marriott research surveys. The same types of information would be requested to complete a gift certificate purchase, register for a Marriott Rewards promotion, enter a sweepstakes or online game, to enroll in the Marriott Rewards program or to redeem Marriott Rewards points. On occasion, we use third parties to provide us with additional contact information about you given the information you provided to us directly. For example, if we know your name and postal address, we may use a third party to provide us with your email address. We would then use this information for market analysis and marketing purposes.

Updating Your Marriott Rewards Account Information
You can access and review, update, or deactivate your Marriott Rewards information online.  If you deactivate your account, all information not already required and stored as a condition of membership will be deleted.
Please note that Marriott will never send you an email requesting your password, credit card number or social security number. If you receive an email that looks like it's from Marriott, but asks you for your credit card number or social security number, it's a fraudulent email, or "phish." We recommend that you do the following:
Forward the email to the Federal Trade Commission at spam@uce.gov or call 1-877-FTC-HELP (1-877-382-4357) to report it. The FTC uses the spam stored in this database to pursue law enforcement actions against people who send deceptive email.
Delete the email.
If you believe "phishers" have gotten access to your personal or financial information, we recommend that you also do the following:
Change your password.
Contact credit reporting services and have a fraud alert attached to your credit report file. Please be aware that the perpetrator may attempt to use your information to establish accounts or obtain credit at other businesses in their name.

Securing the Transmission and Storage of Information
We treat the information you provide to us as confidential information; it is, accordingly, subject to our company's security procedures and policies regarding protection and use of confidential information. When we ask you for credit card data, it is transferred over a Secured Sockets Layer (SSL) line, provided you are using a SSL enabled browser such as Microsoft Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox. We also use SSL on other pages where you would enter personally identifiable information. This ensures that your information is encrypted as it travels over the Internet. This secure mode is enabled before any such information is transmitted from your computer or web-enabled device.  You will know you are in secure mode when the padlock or key icon in the lower right-hand or left-hand corner of the computer screen appears in the locked position.  In addition, when accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https."
After information reaches Marriott, it is stored on a secure server that resides behind firewalls designed to block unauthorized access from outside of Marriott.  Because laws applicable to personal information vary by country, our hotels or other business operations may put in place additional measures that vary depending on the applicable legal requirements.  Information collected on the Web sites covered by this privacy statement is generally processed and stored in the United States.

Travel Related Services
To provide you with a single source for purchasing packages that include other travel-related services such as airline tickets or rental cars, we have entered into agreements with select reputable third-party travel companies that aggregate inventory information from suppliers such as airlines and car rental companies.  If you desire to purchase a package that is facilitated through Marriott.com you will be linked to a Marriott-branded Web site that is hosted by the travel company.  If you choose to purchase a package, it is necessary for you to provide personally identifiable information to execute the purchase. This information is then provided to the suppliers (e.g., airlines) for processing.  We have entered into contracts with these third-party travel companies requiring that they secure your personally identifiable information as well as use it only to execute the transactions you request.  The same security and privacy commitments have been obtained from the suppliers.  However, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you have supplied directly to a supplier in any manner, in the past or in the future, is subject to their privacy statement and practices, for which Marriott has no responsibility.

Disclosure of Information to Third Parties
In addition to the travel-related services and required information sharing described directly above, Marriott does use the services of third parties, such as market researchers,
fulfillment houses, email service providers and mail houses that process mail for the Marriott group of companies, persons authorized by you, and Marriott franchisees as well as such entities and marketing companies that provide these services for the Marriott group of companies and Marriott franchisees. These parties are contractually prohibited from using personally identifiable information for any purpose other than for the purpose Marriott specifies. We do provide non-personally identifiable information to certain service providers for their use on an aggregated basis for the purpose of performing their contractual obligations to us. Except as described in this paragraph and the sections above titled “Marriott Rewards Communications and Use of Member Information” and “Travel Related Services” we do not permit the sale or transfer of personally identifiable information to entities outside of the Marriott family of companies and hotels and our third party service providers for any non-Marriott use without your approval.

Pixel Tags
Marriott and its third-party service providers use pixel tags (also known as "clear gifs" "beacon gifs" etc.).  Pixel tags are not visible to the user of the Web site and consist of a few lines of computer coding delivered with the Web page.  Pixel tags are not used to collect any personally identifiable information about you apart from what you voluntarily provide us in your dealings with Marriott.  Marriott and our email service provider use pixel tags to:
Track customer response to Marriott advertisements and Web site content;
Determine your ability to receive HTML-based email messages.  Our email service provider includes a pixel tag, which they refer to as a "coded sensor" in all of the HTML-based messages sent on our behalf.  The sensor activates when the email message is opened and flags the email address of the user as one that is capable of receiving HTML-based email messages.  This capability helps our service provider to send the email in a format you can read.  The sensor does not collect or use any other information.  If you cannot receive HTML, you will not receive a functioning sensor;
Know how many users open an email and allow our service provider to compile aggregated statistics about an email campaign for us; and
Allow us to better target interactive advertising, enhance customer support and site usability, and provide offers and promotions that we believe would be of interest to you.
