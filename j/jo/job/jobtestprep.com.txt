Test Practice Information
Registered users who practice any test have a detailed log of their practice which includes:
Time Stamp of practice sessions
Number of tests viewed
Number of tests completed
Test score
This information is analysed for the purpose of providing customers with personalised recommendations for successful test preparation. For example, if the JobTestPrep experts see that a customer may have purchased the wrong product for their test, they may refer to the customers test practice information to see which tests the customer has been practicing with. If a customer reaches out for assistance, their previous test practice information enables our experts to give a personalised recommendation for further practice.
Additionally, test practice information may be anonymously collated and analysed to check which tests are required for specific assessments, test providers or institutes, for the purpose of making recommendations to other users.
