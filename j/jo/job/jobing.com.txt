Jobing.com Privacy Statement
Home > Jobing.com Privacy Statement
Jobing.com has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to the privacy of our users. We give our best effort to ensure that the information that you submit to us remains private, and that information is utilized only for the purposes described herein. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for Jobing.com.
Resumes - Jobing.com gives you the ability to place your resume online in our database in a few different ways. First, you may store your resume in our system, but ask that it be "confidential." In this way, your resume is not searchable by employers or recruiters through our resume search feature, but may be used to apply for jobs. You may also specify if your resume is to be searchable by "employers"--those organizations that are direct employers--and/or "recruiters/agencies," which are those organizations who may be recruiters, staffing agencies, or headhunters. If you allow your resume to be "searchable," it will be available to employers or agencies (whichever your specify) that sign up for Jobing.com’s resume service. Jobing.com is not responsible for employers or agencies that may misuse our system, but we will make our best effort to ensure that users utilize the system in a proper manner. You may change your information or the confidentiality of your resume at any time by visiting our web site. You can also delete it from the website if you wish. Employers and recruiters may have already downloaded your resume, so we cannot take responsibility for your resume after it has been downloaded.
