However, we use analytic tools (including cookies) to capture marketing and aggregate visitor information about how people use our site and how they may have been directed to our site by marketing partners and agents. If cookies cannot be set, we may use IP addresses to identify the web browser. Many browsers may share an IP address, such as a proxy server, which prohibits these addresses from unique identification.
What is the DoubleClick DART cookie?
The DoubleClick DART cookie is used by Google in the ads served on the websites of its partners, such as websites displaying AdSense ads or participating in Google certified ad networks. When users visit a partner's website and either view or click on an ad, a cookie may be dropped on that end user's browser. The data gathered from these cookies will be used to help better serve and manage ads on the publisher's site(s) and across the web.
Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to your website.
Google's use of the DART cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and/or other sites on the Internet.
Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the advertising opt-out page. (Alternatively, you can direct users to opt out of a third-party vendor's use of cookies by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page.)
