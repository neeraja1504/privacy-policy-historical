Collection of Information
When we collect personal information about you we will collect this information from you lawfully and fairly and not in any unreasonably intrusive way. You acknowledge and agree that we may collect this information from you in connection with or as a consequence of your use of our site.
Personal Information
Job Seekers do not have to provide any personal information in order to perform job searches; however in some areas of the website, Jobs.co.za requires your personal information such as your name, address, email address, contact information and other discernible identifiable information. In certain areas we may collect personal information pertaining to your work history, remuneration and desired job interests. For instance, Jobs.co.za may request that you register as a Job Seeker, create a profile of personal information and desired job related criteria. Job Seekers will have the option to add a CV to the website which may contain personal and work related information. Job Seekers choosing to use Jobs.co.za to create a Profile to be added to our Job Seeker database will provide Jobs.co.za with personal information which will be used in accordance with this privacy statement. Disclosure of information should preferably be limited to relevant career related data and as such, we discourage irrelevant data such as race, political or religious beliefs, sexual orientation or the likes to be disclosed in your CV. However, should a CV contain such data, Job Seekers agree that this information may be used in accordance with this privacy statement.
Should Jobs.co.za modify the way in which personally identifiable information is used then users will be notified on the website and by email. Should users choose to opt-out of having your information used in this new manner, then users are responsible for contacting Jobs.co.za within one month of receiving such notification to avoid having information used in this manner. Should a user not contact Jobs.co.za within that month, Jobs.co.za shall assume that the user consents to having this information used in the new manner.
Third Party Services
Jobs.co.za may indirectly collect information about you when you choose to utilise any of our third party or partner services, for example, registering to utilise the identification and background check services. Such information will be subject to, and treated in accordance with the policies and practices described in this statement.

Although this information is gathered, please note that is not linked to your personally identifiable information. In addition Cookies (a small data file that your browser writes to your own computer's hard drive in order to remember certain information and is linked to some personally identifiable information while on our site) may be used to store your Handle and Password so that you don't need to type these in each time you log in, thereby saving time whilst on our website.

Public Information
Should a user choose to post any information of a personal nature in public areas on Jobs.co.za such as the Blog or in a searchable CV database, please note that this information may be collected and used by others over whom Jobs.co.za has no control and, as such Jobs.co.za may not be held responsible for third party usage of information that you willingly post or that you have chosen to make available in public areas on Jobs.co.za. Be aware however, that Jobs.co.za does require registered recruiters to enter into a terms of usage agreement with Jobs.co.za to prevent them from using Job Seeker information for any purpose other than that prescribed to under the guidelines of Jobs.co.za and for the purpose of assisting Job Seekers in finding jobs and career related guidance. Furthermore, Job Seekers should note that Jobs.co.za's policy is to allow bona fide recruitment agencies access to search all public CV's and Profiles posted by Job Seekers. Employers (Company's) not registered as recruitment agencies are prohibited from searching the public Job Seeker CV database. In the event that an employer is able to access the public Job Seeker database, Jobs.co.za may not be held responsible for the usage of this information. Jobs.co.za does however enforce every reasonable measure to protect employee's personal information from being accessed by employers.
Disclosure of Information
If required by a governmental entity or regulatory authority, Jobs.co.za may disclose such information if legally required to do so or if we believe in good faith that such action is necessary to conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process, to protect the rights or property of Jobs.co.za or its affiliated companies or if required in the event of preventing a crime or to protect the personal safety of users or the public.
In the event that any third party may have acquired a substantial portion of Jobs.co.za, or in the event of a merger, complete acquisition or substantial purchase of assets, Jobs.co.za may disclose and transfer such information to said third party. In addition, in the event Jobs.co.za may become subject to involuntary or voluntary insolvency proceedings, Jobs.co.za (or its representative in such proceedings) may sell, license or otherwise dispose of such information in a court approved transaction. In the event of such proceedings transpiring, Jobs.co.za shall notify all users by email or otherwise. While we will endeavour to require the successor company to maintain this Privacy Policy, we cannot guarantee that this policy will remain in effect after such a corporate action.
Use of Information
Jobs.co.za may collect information from our users at several different points on our website. We collect information about you so that we can allow you to participate on our website as a result of your voluntary option to engage in activities on our website. Where we may collect information from users from any other means of correspondence such as emails and telephone conversations, from a third party or from user participation in special promotions with third parties on our website, such information shall only be shared with third parties with your explicit consent to do so as a result of your participation in any promotions. The information that we collect from you will not be sold, shared or rented out to any third party in any way other than as disclosed in this privacy statement.
All information gathered on our website whether personal, demographic, technical or financial, is collected for the purpose of administering and managing registrations, responding to queries, operating or enhancing our website and for the purpose of providing a satisfactory user experience through delivering services offered by Jobs.co.za to Job Seekers and Recruiters alike.
Use of Financial Information
Should we need to collect financial information about users for any purpose of transacting with our website, such information may be made available to our partners in certain cases, such as for charging you for requested services. Should we request users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected using SSL. While on a secure page, such as our registration form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. While we use encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. The servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment.
Registration

Promotional communications and newsletters are optional and may be un-subscribed to by our users. Should a user elect to use our referral service for informing a friend about our website, information regarding the friend (such as name and email address) shall be collected. Such information will be used to send the friend an invitation or promotional communication by email to introduce the Jobs.co.za website and services to them.
