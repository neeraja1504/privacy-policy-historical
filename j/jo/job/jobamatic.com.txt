1. Introduction
THIS IS A NEW PRIVACY POLICY, WHICH IS IN EFFECT AS OF August 3, 2018. BY USING THE SITE, YOU ACCEPT THESE NEW TERMS.
Simply Hired ("SH Inc." or "Simply Hired") has drafted its Privacy Policy to ensure that you can clearly understand our data and security practices and policies as you use Simply Hired's websites, apps and mobile services (the "Site" or "Sites"). This Privacy Policy describes the types of Personal Data we collect, how we use the information, with whom we share it, and the choices you can make about our collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Data. The phrase "Personal Data" refers to information that personally identifies you, such as your name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card number or other billing information. We also describe the measures we take to protect the security of your Personal Data and how you can contact us about our privacy practices.
This Privacy Policy incorporates by reference the Terms Of Use for the Sites, which apply to this Privacy Policy. When you visit the Sites or provide us with information, you consent to our use and disclosure of the information we collect or receive, as described in this Privacy Policy, unless separate terms are offered by you in writing and accepted in writing by Simply Hired.
Personal data (“Personal Data”) refers to any information that identifies you as a specific individual, and non-personal data (“Non-Personal Data”) refers to any information that does not identify you as a specific individual. Please note that at all times Simply Hired will adhere to the applicable statutory definition in determining what is and is not Personal Data for the purposes of this Privacy Policy. Where this Privacy Policy refers to “information” or “your information” this may include both Personal and Non-Personal Data.
Please review this Privacy Policy periodically, as we may update it from time to time without prior notice to reflect changes in our data practices. We will post a notice on our Sites to notify you of any significant changes to our Privacy Policy and will indicate when it was most recently updated.
2. Information We Collect
We collect information about you when you use our Sites. We may also obtain information about you from our business partners, other third parties and publicly available information.
The types of information we may obtain include:
Your Personal Data, if you choose to provide it or if we obtain it in the manner described above. If you wish to receive an email job alert, you must provide an email address. If you do not wish to continue to receive job alerts, please unsubscribe by pressing the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any job alert.
Job search behavior and preferences and a record of the searches that you make on our Sites. We do this in order to present you with recommendations based on your interests as expressed previously through your activities on our Sites.
Other details that you may submit to us or that may be included in the information provided to us by third parties, which is provided in the course of the hiring process. Such third parties may include Simply Hired affiliates sharing certain information with Simply Hired where you have agreed in advance to such sharing. Any Personal Data that Simply Hired may obtain from other third-party sources will be processed by Simply Hired in accordance with this Privacy Policy and all applicable laws.
We may collect information stored in your social media profile that you authorize us to access when you use your social media profile to invoke features on the Sites. Simply Hired provides software applications ("Apps") available to the public. If you decide to download one of our Apps, we may collect your profile information, which will be limited to your social network site user ID, email address, name, city, state, social network site profile image URL, and employment history, including job titles and company names.
2.1 Storage of your Information
Simply Hired shall retain users’ Personal Data to the extent such retention is adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which they are processed. In particular, Simply Hired shall not retain Personal Data for any longer than necessary to perform the services outlined in this Privacy Policy.
Simply Hired may also store the information detailed in section 2 of the Privacy Policy on its equipment or the equipment of third parties that Simply Hired has a relationship with. Such storage services will be governed by appropriate protections, as required by applicable rules.
2.2 What Personal Data is Required
Simply Hired will indicate to you at the point of provision as to whether or not particular Personal Data provided by you is required in order to provide particular Simply Hired services or features to you. Where Personal Data that is required is not provided by you then the particular feature or service may not be available to you.
2.3 The Basis on Which Simply Hired Collects Your Personal Data
Simply Hired collects and processes your Personal Data on the basis of different legal grounds, depending on the nature of the Personal Data being provided and the type of processing involved. More information is provided on this here.
Performance of a Contract
Most of the Personal Data processed by Simply Hired is performed on the basis that it is necessary for the performance of our agreement with you, or in order to take steps at the request of the user prior to entering such an agreement.
Legitimate Interest
A second ground relied upon by Simply Hired for other types of processing of your Personal Data is that it is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by Simply Hired. Such legitimate interests will include where we believe you have a reasonable expectation that we will perform a particular type of processing on your behalf, or where such processing is strictly necessary for fraud detection and prevention.
Compliance with a Legal Obligation
A third ground relied upon for certain types of processing is that it is necessary in order to allow Simply Hired comply with a legal obligation.
Consent
Finally, in certain limited situations, Simply Hired relies on your consent in order to process your Personal Data. Where Simply Hired requires your consent in order to collect and process certain Personal Data, we seek your consent at the time of provision, and such processing will only be performed where consent is secured.
2.4 Children's Privacy

We collect this information by automated means, such as cookies and web beacons, as described in more detail below.
4. Information We Share
The Sites may track the total number of visitors to our Sites, the number of visitors to each page of our Sites, IP addresses, External Web Sites linked to, search terms and the domain names of our users' Internet Service Providers, operating system and browser type, and we may analyze these data for trends and statistics in the aggregate, but such information will be maintained, used and disclosed in aggregate form only and it will not contain personally identifiable information. We also may collect aggregate demographic information. Such aggregate information may be collected from data that you have provided to us via usage of the Sites and/or public records, and is not unique to you nor is it linked to any Personal Data that can identify any individual person. We may use such aggregate information to analyze trends, administer the Sites, track users' movements, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We may share this aggregate information with third parties, including our affiliated and parent companies, for various reasons related to our business to assist them in targeting advertisements to appropriate audiences.
Other than instances in which users opt to provide their Personal Data via a job application, include it in a job posting or otherwise provide permission to share it, we do not sell our users' Personal Data to anyone for any reason.
We share Personal Data with our service providers, including affiliated companies and our parent company, which are located in jurisdictions outside your own. This helps us in the delivery of our own products and services to you. These service providers may only use or disclose the information as necessary to perform services on our behalf or as otherwise required by law. Any such sharing is performed in full compliance with applicable data protection rules and subject to appropriate safeguards, primarily through the use of extensive data protection agreements, in order to ensure adequate protection of users’ Personal Data. If you do not wish your information to be transferred in this way you should not use this Site.
Simply Hired also may disclose specific user information when we determine, in good faith, that such disclosure is necessary to comply with the law, to cooperate with or seek assistance from law enforcement, to prevent a crime or protect national security, or to protect the interests or safety of Simply Hired or other users of the Sites. This means, for example, that Simply Hired may honor subpoenas, search warrants, law enforcement or court-mandated requests to reveal a user’s electronic address and identity, or other properly requested information.
Personal Data we have collected may be passed on to a third party in the event of a bankruptcy or another corporate reorganization of Simply Hired. In addition, if we are acquired by or merged with another company, or in the event of any sale of assets or other transfer of ownership by Simply Hired to a third party (whether by merger, sale or otherwise), or any other reorganization or joint venture, or assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any of Simply Hired’s business, assets or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceeding), the Personal Data we have collected may be transferred to such third party as well as such third party’s affiliates and subsidiaries, and may be used by such third party in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Please note that the Resume and Saved Jobs products are no longer available on the Sites. Any resume or job application you sent to an Employer via a job application may be kept by the Employer, and you should check such Employer’s privacy policy to understand how they keep your Personal Data.

7. Privacy Shield Frameworks
Simply Hired complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield. Simply Hired has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to such data. If there is any conflict between the policies in this privacy policy and data subject rights under the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/.
With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks, Simply Hired is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.
Pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks, EU and Swiss individuals have the right to obtain our confirmation of whether we maintain personal information relating to you in the United States. Upon request, we will provide you with access to the personal information that we hold about you. You may also may correct, amend, or delete the personal information we hold about you. In order to exercise these rights, please follow the steps outlined in Section 5 of this policy. If requested to remove data, we will respond within a reasonable timeframe.
As noted in Section 4 of this policy, Simply Hired may share your data with third parties. If you do not wish for your data to be shared with third parties, please follow the steps outlined in Section 5.3 of this policy and we will delete your personal data and cease the processing of said data.
Simply Hired’s accountability for personal data that it receives in the United States under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to a third party is described in the Privacy Shield Principles. In particular, Simply Hired remains responsible and liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if third-party agents that it engages to process the personal data on its behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless Simply Hired proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Simply Hired commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield.

If your Privacy Shield complaint cannot be resolved through the above channels, under certain conditions, you may invoke binding arbitration for some residual claims not resolved by other redress mechanisms. See Privacy Shield Annex 1 at https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-introduction
8. How We Protect Personal Data
Simply Hired seeks to use reasonable security measures to help protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the Personal Data under Simply Hired’s control. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. In addition, please note that emails, messages sent via your web browser, and other similar means of communication with other users, are not encrypted. Therefore, while we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its security.
Please also be aware that we may use third-party cloud service providers that provide hosting, data storage and other services pursuant to standard terms and conditions that may be nonnegotiable; these service providers have informed us or the general public that they apply security measures they consider adequate for the protection of information within their system, or they have a general reputation for applying such measures. However, we will not be liable (to the fullest extent permitted by law) for any damages that may result from the misuse of any information, including Personal Data, by these companies. Please see the section on International Data Transfers of this Privacy Policy for liabilities pertaining to the transfer of Personal Data of individuals in the EU and Switzerland.
