Jora
Jora's commitment to maintaining your privacy
This Privacy Statement has been prepared by Job Seeker Pty Ltd (“ Jora ”). Jora owns and operates the website located at jora.com (across desktop, mobile, tablet and apps and including any subdomains) (“ the Site ”). This Privacy Statement discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for the Site.
Definitions
Where used in this Privacy Statement, the terms “personal information”, and “Australian Privacy Principle(s)” have the meaning attributed to those terms in the Privacy Act (Cth) 1988 (“ Privacy Act ”).
In this Privacy Statement:
any reference to “Jora”, “we”, “us” and “our” refers to Job Seeker Pty Ltd and each of its related bodies corporate (as that term is defined in the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth));
“ Advertiser ” refers to individuals or entities that post job ads on our Site or otherwise use the Site to source potential Candidates for job vacancies;
“ Candidates ” refers to users of the Site and “ Registered Users ” refers to Candidates who register on the Site; and
Candidates, Advertisers and users who otherwise subscribe for Jora products, services or information offered via the Site are referred to generically in this Statement as “ visitors ”, " users " or " you ", unless the context provides that only Candidates, Registered Users or Advertisers are being referred to.
Collecting information on Jora visitors
Jora collects non-personal information on Site visits by users including, without limitation, which sections of the Site are most frequently visited, how often, and for how long. This data is always used as aggregated, non-personal information, and may be shared with Jora related parties or service providers to provide them with information relating to how Jora visitors 'use' the Site. This is done for the purpose of providing you with the best and most efficient career management and recruitment services.
IP Addresses
Jora's web servers gather your IP address to assist with the diagnosis of problems or support issues with our services, and to monitor the use of our Site.
Cookies
Jora uses cookies and applets to provide Candidates with a better browsing experience and tailor advertisements that appear, (on the Site or other websites) to your browsing preferences. These cookies and applets collect non-personal information such as preferences and click activity for measurement and for features such as remembering your search criteria for the 'My Search' function.
Jora uses cookies and scripts in respect of Advertisers to assist Jora in improving website performance, making business decisions, aiding in error reporting and testing new functionality. These cookies and scripts collect non-personal information such as preferences and click activity for measurement and for Site features.
If you do not wish to have cookies active whilst you browse the Site you can "opt out" by modifying the privacy options in your browser. However, doing so will prevent access to some areas of the Site and limit your use of some of the Jora services.
In addition to the above, where users access the Jora mobile applications (" Jora Apps ") we use third party software development kits (SDK's) and services which collect non personal information relating to your use of the Jora Apps, including tracking of app installs and re-engagement. This information is used to tailor and measure advertisements to install and/or use the Jora Apps which appear on third party sites/apps and are targeted towards users' usage preferences.
If you want to opt-out from the collection and usage of information for advertisement targeting you can do so by enabling "Limit Ad Tracking" (Settings>Privacy>Advertising) on your iOS device or by enabling the "Opting out of interest-based ads" option (Settings>Services>Ads) on your Android device. By opting out from ad targeting Jora and its third party providers will not use the collected information to target ads to you, however the information collected may continue to be used by Jora for, amongst other things, estimation of user numbers, advertising fraud detection and debugging.
Third Party Measurement
In order to better understand our users, Jora utilises third party measurement companies to assess Site and mobile Site traffic. A tracking code is used to collect the following information on the usage of the Site:
The number of page views (or page impressions) that occur on the Site;
The number of unique visitors to the Site;
How long these unique visitors (on average) spend on the Site when they do visit; and
Common entry and exit points into the Site.
This aggregated, non-personal information is collated and provided to Jora to assist in analysing the usage of the Site. This data is also accessible by media organisations and research companies, for the purpose of conducting industry comparisons with other Internet websites.
Collecting information on Registered Users
As part of registering with Jora, we collect personal information about Registered Users in order for Registered Users to take full advantage of Jora's services. To do this it will be necessary for Registered Users to provide additional information to Jora.
Registration
Becoming a Registered User allows you to take advantage of more of the tools, services and resources that may assist you in finding a job. To become a Registered User you will need to submit some personal information such as your name and email address. You may access your information at any time by clicking 'Edit Profile' on the 'My Jobs > My Account' section of the Site. You may also delete your account entirely by using the Contact Us form on our Site.
Jora may also use this information in order to customise the service we provide to you. For example, Jora may use this information to create a Jora Profile that you may choose to use in the future. However, we will never activate this Jora Profile (or any other service) without your express consent.
Email Alerts
Email Alerts is an optional service available to Registered Users. To use Email Alerts Registered Users must provide their email address, and information relating to their employment preferences so that Jora can notify Registered Users via email of jobs within their specified criteria. Registered Users can modify or delete their Email Alerts preferences at any time by going to the ' My Alerts ' area of the Site.
Online Applications
Making an online application to a job advertisement on Jora is a free and optional service that requires Candidates to complete mandatory fields (for example first name, last name and email) so that the Advertiser can identify and contact the applicant.
Applications, including attachments such as resumes and cover letters, are either submitted through:
the Site; or
another website on which the Advertiser’s job ad appears which you access via a link on our Site.
If you make an application via the Site we will retain that application on our systems.
Any questions you have relating to a position advertised on Jora, your online application and/or the status of your application should be directed directly to the Advertiser or their nominated agent, not Jora.
Advertisers must comply with all relevant obligations under privacy laws relating to the use and disclosure of personal information. The use of your information (personal or otherwise) by Advertisers is not within the control of Jora and we do not accept responsibility for the conduct of these companies.
Advertisers
Jora collects the company name, email address and mobile phone number of Advertisers from publicly available third party content. Jora uses these details to enable Candidates to apply to jobs.
Where an Advertiser posts a job directly on Jora, Jora will collect and store the details of the job ad. Jora may distribute those advertisements on other channels at its discretion.
Communications from Jora
Jora may also provide you with selected information about job placement and career-related topics in email communications. From time to time Jora may also contact you by telephone. Jora may also make Registered Users and Advertisers aware of additional products and services which form part of your relationship with Jora. Users may opt out of receiving any such communications by clicking 'unsubscribe' in the footer of an email received.
Contractors
Jora may also disclose your personal information to Jora's service providers and contractors from time to time but only for the purpose of assisting us to deliver the products and services we offer to you.
Related Bodies Corporate
Jora may also disclose your personal information to Jora's related bodies corporate from time to time but only for the purpose of assisting Jora and its related bodies corporate to deliver the products and services offered to you.
Storage & Security of Personal Information
Jora takes all reasonable steps to ensure the security of our system and to protect your information from misuse, interference and loss as well as unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. Jora allows you to access your information at any time to keep it accurate and up to date. Any information which we hold for you is stored on secure servers, either in Australia or overseas (including the United States of America), that are protected in controlled facilities.
In addition, our employees and the contractors who provide services related to our information systems are obliged to respect the confidentiality and privacy of any personal information held by Jora.

Please notify us immediately if there is any unauthorised use of your account by any other Internet user, or any other breach of security relating to your account.
Access to Your Information
Unless you become a Registered User, subscribe to email alerts or become an Advertiser, Jora does not collect information that identifies you personally. In addition to the methods listed above for users to update their information, any user is able to at any time request that Jora deletes any personal information held by completing and submitting the form on our Contact Us page. Candidates who have applied for any position on the Site are also able to request their personal information directly from those Advertisers.
Data Transfers
Jora's corporate headquarters are located in Australia, and so your information may be transferred to, and/or stored in, Australia. Sometimes, we transfer or disclose information to third party contractors including to persons and businesses outside Australia including in the Philippines. These transfers are made in order to assist us to provide you with the products and services we offer you. Where we transfer information to persons outside Australia we take reasonable steps to ensure that the recipients of such information do not breach privacy laws in relation to that information.
