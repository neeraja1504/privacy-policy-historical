Job-Hunt.Org is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. Before adding those sites to Job-Hunt's categorized lists of links, each site is evaluated to see if they protect the privacy of their visitors and, particularly, their job applicants. We do not knowingly add sites that treat applicant information casually. However, a site may change its policies and practices after being added to Job-Hunt.
