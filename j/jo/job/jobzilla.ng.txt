Privacy Policy
Overview
jobzilla.ng (“jobzilla.ng”) knows that you care about
how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your
privacy seriously. This policy describes the types of information
collected, how it may and may not be used, and how it is protected. By
visiting jobzilla.ng’s website (“Website”), or using any of our
services on the website (“Website Services”), you acknowledge that you
accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy and
our use of your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Log Files
As with most other websites, we collect and use the data
contained in log files. The information in the log files include your
IP (internet protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider,
such as AOL or Shaw Cable), the browser you used to visit our site
(such as Internet Explorer or Firefox), the time you visited our site
and which pages you visited throughout our site.
Cookies and Web Beacons
We do use cookies to store information, such as your
personal preferences when you visit our site. This could include only
showing you a popup once in your visit, or the ability to login to some
of our features, such as forums.
We also use third party advertisements on jobzilla.ng to
support our site. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as
cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will
also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense
program) information including your IP address, your ISP , the browser
you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash
installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing
New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or
showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing
cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).
DoubleClick DART cookies
We also may use DART cookies for ad serving through Google’s
DoubleClick, which places a cookie on your computer when you are
browsing the web and visit a site using DoubleClick advertising
(including some Google AdSense advertisements). This cookie is used to
serve ads specific to you and your interests (”interest based
targeting”). The ads served will be targeted based on your previous
browsing history (For example, if you have been viewing sites about
visiting Las Vegas, you may see Las Vegas hotel advertisements when
viewing a non-related site, such as on a site about hockey). DART uses
“non personally identifiable information”. It does NOT track personal
information about you, such as your name, email address, physical
address, telephone number, social security numbers, bank account
numbers or credit card numbers. You can opt-out of this ad serving on
all sites using this advertising by visiting http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx
You can chose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies
or third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing
preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security. However, this
can affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as other
websites. This could include the inability to login to services or
programs, such as logging into forums or accounts.
Deleting cookies does not mean you are permanently opted out
of any advertising program. Unless you have settings that disallow
cookies, the next time you visit a site running the advertisements, a
new cookie will be added.
Third Party Sites
jobzilla.ng does not control the privacy policies of third party
sites or service providers to which we provide links. These third party
sites or service providers may use cookies to provide a service or serve
ads based on a user’s prior visits to jobzilla.ng. Please be aware
that if you click on an ad or third party link, you will be subject to
the third party’s privacy policy.
Changes to the jobzilla.ng Privacy Policy
You agree that jobzilla.ng may amend this policy from time
to time by posting the revised Privacy Policy on this Website. Your
continued use of any portion of the Website or jobzilla.ng service
following the posting of the revised policy will constitute your
acceptance of the changes.

clicked on during a visit to the Website; information regarding the
date, time, and duration of your visit; and information you may
volunteer, e.g., in response to survey requests or as part of a
registration. Upon any registration for, and in subsequent interaction
with, Website Services, jobzilla.ng may collect mandatory
information such as your User Name, Password, primary email address,
etc. A “cookie” is a small line of text that is sent to your browser and
stored on your computer when you visit a website. jobzilla.ng uses a
cookie for record-keeping and verification purposes and a cookie helps
us provide better service to you. For example, we use a cookie to verify
your session and user identification and to track the pages within the
Website that you visited. Your browser should have options to accept,
reject or provide you with a notice when a cookie is sent. However, if

Your obligations to other Users
As a User, you have certain obligations to other Users. Some of
these obligations are imposed by applicable law and regulations, and
others have become commonplace in user-friendly communities of
like-minded members. Do not abuse the jobzilla.ng service by using
it to spam, abuse, harass, or otherwise violate this Privacy Policy. You
must not download or otherwise disseminate any information that may be
deemed to be injurious, violent, offensive, or which may otherwise
violate the purpose and spirit of jobzilla.ng and its community of
Users.
Information security
We take appropriate security measures to protect against
unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or
destruction of data. However, no data transmission over the Internet can
be guaranteed to be completely secure. Accordingly, we cannot ensure or
warrant the security of any information that you transmit to us, so you
do so at your own risk. We restrict access to personal information to
employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in
order to process it on our behalf.
Use of Information Collected
We use the information we collect to provide our services and features
to you, to measure and improve those services and features, and to
provide you with customized user experience. We may contact you with
service-related announcements from time to time. Your information will
not be shared with any third parties except as explained below.
As part of our business, we may pass to our service partners
aggregated information (data gathered up across multiple or all user
accounts) regarding visitors, users, and historical transactions in a
manner that will not personally identify any individual user. We may
aggregate personal information and disclose such information in a
non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and other third
parties for their marketing and promotional purposes. However, in these
situations, we do not disclose to these entities any information that
could be used to identify you personally.
We will not sell, rent or transfer your Personally Identifiable
Information to any third party, unless we are required by law, court
order or regulation, or we believe that disclosure is necessary to
comply with law or legal process, or to cooperate with local or federal
authorities, or to protect or defend against fraud, misuse of the
jobzilla.ng Website, breach of any of your obligations hereunder, or
to protect our intellectual property rights. In addition, we may
disclose your Personally Identifiable Information in connection with a
merger, acquisition, or sale of all or substantially all of the assets
of jobzilla.ng to another company (an “Acquirer Company”), provided
that such Personally Identifiable Information shall only be used by the
Acquirer Company in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Privacy Policy. jobzilla.ng will not track your Internet usage
outside of the confines of the jobzilla.ng Website.
