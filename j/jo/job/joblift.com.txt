5. Analysis- and tracking tools
The tracking measures listed below and used by us are carried out on the basis of Art. 6 section 1 s. 1 f GDPR. With the tracking measures used, we want to ensure that our website is designed to meet requirements and is continually optimised. On the other hand, we use the tracking measures to statistically record the use of our website and to evaluate it for the purpose of optimising our offer. These interests are to be regarded as legitimate within the meaning of the aforementioned provision.
The respective data processing purposes and data categories can be found in the corresponding tracking tools.
1. Google Analytics
For the purpose of demand-oriented design and continuous optimization of our pages, we use Google Analytics, a web analysis service provided by Google Inc. (https://www.google.com/intl/us/about/) (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA; hereinafter "Google"). In this context, pseudonymised user profiles are created and cookies (see point 4) are used. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website such as
• Type and version of browser
• Operating system in use
• referrer-URL (previously visited page),
• host name of the accessing computer (IP-address)
• Time of the server request
are transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there. The information is used to evaluate the use of the website, to compile reports on the website activities and to provide further services associated with the use of the website and the Internet for the purposes of market research and demand-oriented design of these Internet pages. This information may also be transferred to third parties if this is required by law or if third parties process this data on behalf of the company. Under no circumstances will your IP address be merged with other data from Google. The IP addresses are anonymized so that an assignment is not possible (IP masking).
You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser, however please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website.
You can also prevent the collection of data generated by the cookie and related to your use of the website (including your IP address) and the processing of this data by Google by downloading and installing a browser add-on (https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en).
As an alternative to the browser add-on, especially for browsers on mobile devices, you can also prevent Google Analytics from collecting data by clicking on this link. An opt-out cookie is set to prevent future collection of your data when you visit this website. The opt-out cookie is only valid in this browser and only for our website and is stored on your device. If you delete the cookies in this browser, you must set the opt-out cookie again.
Further information on data protection in connection with Google Analytics can be found in the Google Analytics Help (https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en).
Data protection authorities require the conclusion of an order data processing agreement for the permissible use of Google Analytics. A template is available at https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html von Google.
2. Google Adwords Conversion Tracking
We also use Google Conversion Tracking to statistically record and evaluate the use of our website for the purpose of optimising it for you. Google Adwords will set a cookie (see sectiongraph 4) on your computer if you have accessed our website via a Google ad.
These cookies expire after 30 days and are not used for personal identification. If the user visits certain pages of the Adwords customer's website and the cookie has not yet expired, Google and the customer can recognize that the user has clicked on the ad and has been redirected to this page.
Each Adwords customer receives a different cookie. Cookies cannot therefore be traced via the websites of Adwords customers. The information collected using the conversion cookie is used to generate conversion statistics for Adwords customers who have opted for conversion tracking. Adwords customers see the total number of users who clicked on their ad and were redirected to a page with a conversion tracking tag. However, you will not receive any information that personally identifies users.
If you do not wish to participate in the tracking process, you can also reject the setting of a cookie required for this - for example using a browser setting that generally deactivates the automatic setting of cookies. You can also deactivate cookies for conversion tracking by setting your browser to block cookies from the "www.googleadservices.com" domain. Google's privacy policy for conversion tracking can be found here (https://services.google.com/sitestats/en.html).
3. Google Tag Manager
This website uses Google Tag Manager. This service allows website tags to be managed via an interface. Google Tag Manager only implements tags. This means that no cookies are set and no personal data is recorded. Google Tag Manager triggers other tags which, in turn, may record data. However, Google Tag Manager does not access this data. If tags have been disabled at the domain or cookie level, this remains in place for all tracking tags if these are implemented with Google Tag Manager. You can find out more about Google Tag Manager by clicking the following link: http://www.google.com/tagmanager/use-policy.html

The operating company of Tradetracker is the Tradetracker Deutschland GmbH, Eiffestraße 426, 20537 Hamburg, Germany.
For this, Tradetracker places a cookie, in which the affiliate partner’s identification number, a reference number of the visitor as well as the advertising media is stored.

10. Bing Ads & Remarketing for Search
The Bing service “Bing Ads” & “Bing Remarketing for Search” is used on the Joblift website, services of the Microsoft Corporation (“Microsoft”) (Microsoft Corporation, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399, USA). The application involves the operating mode “Universal Event Tracking”. This enables allocating data, sessions and interactions to a pseudonymous user ID across multiple devices and therefore, to analyse the activities of a user across all devices.
On behalf of the operator of this website, Microsoft will use this information, to analyse your use of the website, to compile reports on the website activities and to provide the website operator with other services associated with the use of the website and the Internet. Furthermore, these purposes constitute our legitimate interest in data processing. The legal basis for the application of Bing Ads is § 15 sec. 3 of the German Telemedia Act (TMG) or art. 6 sec. 1 lit. f of the GDPR. Sessions and campaigns are terminated after a specified period of time. By default, sessions are terminated after 30 minutes without any activity and campaigns after six months. The time limit for campaigns can be a maximum of two years. You can find more detailed information regarding the terms of use and data privacy at https://advertise.bingads.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/policies/traffic-quality.
If you access one of the web pages of Joblift via a Bing advertisement, a so-called conversion cookie is stored on your end device. The conversion cookie loses its validity after thirty days and does not serve the identification of the data subject. Provided that the cookie has not yet expired, the conversion cookie is used to determine whether certain sub-pages were accessed on our website. The conversion cookie allows Joblift as well as Microsoft to determine whether a data subject, who accessed our website via a Bing Ads ad, generated revenue; i.e. made or aborted a purchase. Neither Joblift or other advertisers of Bing Ads obtain information from Microsoft, with which the data subject can be identified.
“Cookies” are used in the process. The information created in this manner on the use of this website is transmitted to a Microsoft server, among others in the USA and stored there. In the process, the complete IP address is transmitted to a Microsoft server outside the member states of the European Union or to other states party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. The IP address transmitted by your browser in line with Bing Ads is not consolidated with other data from Bing. Furthermore, Bing complies with the privacy policies of the “EU-U.S. Privacy Shield” agreement. Bing uses this information on behalf of Joblift to analyse the use of the website, to compile reports on website activities for Joblift and to provide other services associated with the use of the website and Internet. Bing only forwards this information to third parties if this is required by law or insofar as third parties process this data on behalf of Bing. Third-party providers, including Bing, use stored cookies to place advertisements based on the previous visits of a user to this website. Under no circumstances will Bing link your IP address to other data. The collection and storage of data can be objected to at any time effective for the future.

6. Social Media Plug-ins
We use social plug-ins of the social networks Facebook, Twitter and Instagram on our website on the basis of Art. 6 par. 1 p. 1 lit. f GDPR in order to make our company better known. The underlying advertising purpose is to be regarded as a legitimate interest within the meaning of the GDPR. Responsibility for data protection-compliant operation must be guaranteed by the respective provider. The integration of these plug-ins by us takes place in the way of the so-called two-click method around visitors of our web page in the best possible way to protect.
1. Facebook
Our website uses social media plugins from Facebook to personalize their use. For this we use the "LIKE" or "SHARE"-button. This is an offer from Facebook.
When you access a page of our website that contains such a plugin, your browser establishes a direct connection to the Facebook servers. The content of the plugin is transmitted directly from Facebook to your browser and integrated into the website.
By integrating the plugins, Facebook receives the information that your browser has called up the corresponding page of our website, even if you do not have a Facebook account or are not currently logged on to Facebook. This information (including your IP address) is transmitted directly from your browser to a Facebook server in the USA and stored there.
If you are logged in to Facebook, Facebook can directly associate your visit to our website with your Facebook account. If you interact with the plugins, for example by pressing the "LIKE" or "SHARE" button, the corresponding information is also transmitted directly to a Facebook server and stored there. The information is also published on Facebook and displayed to your Facebook friends.
Facebook may use this information for the purposes of advertising, market research and demand-oriented design of Facebook pages. To this end, Facebook creates usage, interest and relationship profiles, e.g. to evaluate your use of our website with regard to the advertisements displayed to you on Facebook, to inform other Facebook users about your activities on our website and to provide other services associated with the use of Facebook.
If you do not want Facebook to associate the information collected through our website with your Facebook account, you must log out of Facebook before visiting our website.
The purpose and scope of the data collection and the further processing and use of the data by Facebook as well as your rights and setting options for the protection of your privacy can be found in the data protection information (https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/) of Facebook.

Our website contains plugins of the short message network of Twitter Inc. (Twitter) integrated. You can recognize the Twitter plugins (tweet button) by the Twitter logo on our site. An overview of tweet buttons can be found here (https://about.twitter.com/resources/buttons).
When you access a page of our website that contains such a plugin, a direct connection is established between your browser and the Twitter server. Twitter receives the information that you have visited our site with your IP address. If you click the Twitter "tweet button" while logged into your Twitter account, you can link the contents of our pages on your Twitter profile. This allows Twitter to associate the visit of our pages with your user account. We would like to point out that, as the provider of the pages, we are not aware of the content of the data transmitted or how it is used by Twitter.
If you do not want Twitter to associate your visit to our pages, please log out of your Twitter account.

3. Instagram
Our website also uses so-called Social Plugins ("Plugins") from Instagram, which is operated by Instagram LLC, 1601 Willow Road, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA ("Instagram").
The plug-ins are marked with an Instagram logo, for example in the form of an "Instagram camera".
When you access a page of our website that contains such a plugin, your browser establishes a direct connection to Instagram's servers. Instagram transfers the content of the plugin directly to your browser and integrates it into the page. This integration informs Instagram that your browser has called up the corresponding page of our website, even if you do not have an Instagram profile or are not currently logged in to Instagram.
This information (including your IP address) is transmitted directly from your browser to an Instagram server in the USA and stored there. If you are logged in to Instagram, Instagram can immediately associate your visit to our website with your Instagram account. If you interact with the plugins, for example by pressing the "Instagram" button, this information is also transmitted directly to an Instagram server and stored there.
The information is also published on your Instagram account and displayed to your contacts.
If you do not want Instagram to associate the information collected through our website directly with your Instagram account, you must log out of Instagram before visiting our website.

9. Data Integrity
We use the most common SSL (Secure Socket Layer) method in connection with the highest level of encryption supported by your browser. Usually this is a 256 bit encryption. If your browser does not support 256-bit encryption, we use 128-bit v3 technology instead. Whether a single page of our website is transmitted in encrypted form is indicated by the closed display of the key or lock symbol in the lower status bar of your browser.
We also use suitable technical and organisational security measures to protect your data against accidental or intentional manipulation, partial or complete loss, destruction or unauthorised access by third parties. Our security measures are continuously improved in line with technological developments.
