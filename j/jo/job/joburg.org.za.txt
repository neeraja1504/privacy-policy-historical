2. COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAW Protecting User privacy is of utmost importance to the CoJ. Accordingly, the CoJ has developed this Privacy Policy in order to safeguard the User’s personal information and to protect the confidentiality thereof. In so doing, the CoJ has paid particular attention to the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Act, 108 of 1996, the Electronic Communications Act, 25 of 2002 and the Protection of Personal Information Bill of 2006 (currently before the South African Law Commission) and the common law so as to ensure compliance with all relevant statutory requirements and best practice under South African law.
3. NO LIABILITY FOR UNAUTHORISED DISCLOSURE While the CoJ will do all things reasonably necessary to protect the User’s rights of privacy whilst on the CoJ website, the CoJ cannot accept any liability whatsoever for unauthorised or unlawful disclosure of the User’s personal and confidential information made by third parties who are not subject to the CoJ’s control.
4. PERSONAL INFORMATION For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “personal information” includes the User’s initials, surname, first name, passport number/identity number, date of birth, gender, cellphone number, e-mail address, home telephone number, work telephone number, fax number, residential address, postal address, initial of spouse, first name of spouse, identity number of spouse, date of birth of spouse, name of a non-relative and contact number (required for purposes of registration) account numbers where accounts are transmitted via e-mail (required for purposes of meter readings), declaration of income (where a juristic person registers for the RSC levy service), the value of the User’s property (where the User makes use of the Valuation Service), vehicle registration number and date of offence (where a User wishes to pay a traffic fine online) and information pertaining to juristic persons (e.g. Company Name, Company registration number).

7. COOKIES The CoJ uses cookie technology which comprises tiny pieces of data or a small text file that is stored on a User’s computer hard drive and which contains information about a User, so that the next time a User visits the Website, the cookie reminds the CoJ of who the User is, enabling the CoJ to achieve its goal of providing a valuable online experience to all Users. A User is able to however, disable this cookie technology in its own Internet browser.

10. RETENTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION All personal information is stored on the CoJ registration database until such time as the User elects to de-register itself from the Services. As such, all personal information will only be retained for as long as it is necessary to fulfil the purposes mentioned in clauses 4 and 6 above.
11. ACCURATE AND UP TO DATE The CoJ will use its best endeavours to keep the personal information it collects as accurate, complete and up to date as is necessary for the purposes mentioned in clause 4 and 6 above, and the CoJ shall, from time to time, request the User to update its personal information on the Website. Users are able to review or update any personally identifiable information that the CoJ holds on the User by accessing its account online or by e-mailing or phoning the CoJ. In order to better protect Users and safeguard personal information, the CoJ does take steps to verify a User’s identity before granting access to its account or making any corrections to its personal information. As part of its routine maintenance, the CoJ removes undelivered e-mail addresses from its database after a period of three months.
12. SECURITY The CoJ uses encryption, firewalls and other security technology and procedures to help protect the confidentiality of personal information and prevent unauthorized access or improper use thereof.
