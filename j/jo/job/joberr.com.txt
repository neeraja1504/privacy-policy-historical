We recognize that your privacy is important.  This document outlines the types of personal information we receive and may collect when you use joberr.com, as well as some of the steps we take to safeguard information.  We hope this will help you make an informed decision about using joberr.com and whether to share personal information with us. This privacy statement applies to the joberr.com website (the “Website” or “Site”) and the products and services that are located in the joberr.com domain.
joberr.com strives to maintain the highest standards of decency, fairness and integrity in all our operations.
Personal Information
Joberr.com collects personally identifiable information from the visitors to our website only on a voluntary basis.  Personal information collected on a voluntary basis may include name and email address currently (this list of personal information may increase in the future for the purpose of running sweepstakes and contests, but if it does, changes will be noted in this section).
This information is collected if you sign up for an account at joberr.com and become a member of the Website (the ways joberr.com collects personal information may increase in the future and when this happens, changes will be made accordingly to this section).  The information collected is used for the operation of the Website, to contact members (see next section, “ Emails sent to Members ” below) and respond to visitor inquiries.
It should me noted that if you wish, you may choose to remain anonymous during every interaction on and with joberr.com.  There’s no obligation to share any of your personal information, beyond your email address, to fully operate the website as either the Seller or Buyer of Jobs.
If we make material changes in the collection of personally identifiable information we will inform you by placing a notice on our site and making the necessary changes to this document.
Emails sent to Members
Joberr.com may choose to contact its members via email for 2 very specific reasons:
1. Notification mailings sent out to both Buyers and Sellers; a few instances of these are when a new account is opened, when someone wants to buy your Job, when the Job is entirely complete and a notice is sent out asking for feedback.
2. Newsletters, promotional mailings and the like.
The notification mailings are absolutely necessary for the site to function properly.  These will consist only of reporting to members that either an action is required from them or a notification of some kind directly related to the operation of joberr.com.  There will be no “opt-out” to these mailings as if you are actively engaged in using joberr.com, these mailings are deemed absolutely necessary.  Moreover, if you’ve ceased your use of joberr.com or don’t have active Jobs and aren’t purchasing Jobs on the Website, there will be nothing to notify you about and you won’t receive any of these notification mailings.
As the newsletters and promotional mailings are not deemed absolutely necessary, there will be an option to “Unsubscribe” of further communications from joberr.com at the bottom of every email.  While the newsletters and any promotional mailings joberr.com sends out will be deemed beneficial by the owner and operator of joberr.com, there is an understanding that a member may wish not to receive such mailings.  While these mailings may not be exclusively related to joberr.com, the majority of said emails will be Website related and deemed beneficial by joberr.com ownership.
Promotions
Joberr will run periodic promotions.  Although this Privacy Policy will at all times remain valid, there will be additional Terms for any and all Promotions held on joberr.
Some promotions on the Site will be opt-in promotions where others may be set up to include all members of joberr in one way or another.  Many will necessitate some interaction with the website to be entered into the contest.  All of these scenarios will be explained in detail for each individual promotion in the Promotion section of the joberr Blog.
Included in the Promotion section is a Promotion Guidelines document that will be valid for each Promotion and will be edited when necessary.  If this document is altered, the Revision Date will be updated and any and all changes will be made clear within that document.
