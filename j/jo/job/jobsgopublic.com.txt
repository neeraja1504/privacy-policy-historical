How do we use your personal data?
We use your personal data to provide our services, e.g. send service messages, process payments and/or fulfil orders.
We use your personal data to help us communicate with you effectively should you try to contact us via our website.
If you are a jobseeker, our system will send you emails with details of any jobs which fit the criteria you have specified. If you agreed on our site, we may also allow recruiters to email you via our system with details of other jobs which may be of interest to you. (This step will not involve any of your personal data being passed to recruiters.)
We may use your email address or phone number to contact you in connection with your job applications, for example to follow up an incomplete application.
If you have given permission on our website, we may use your personal data to send you emails (or other communications such as mail, phone or SMS) with details of our or third party services which may be of interest to you including our newsletter, competitions, surveys and information about special offers or promotions.
We may use personal data to recognise you when you visit or return to our website to track anonymised traffic and usage patterns, to prevent or detect fraud or abuses or to help us improve our website. We may use cookies to do this. See above.
We retain personal data from closed accounts in order to comply with legal obligations, enforce our terms and conditions, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations and take other actions as permitted by law.
We may access, remove, alter, store or otherwise use any personal data if we have reason to believe that it breaches our terms and conditions, or that such steps are necessary to protect us or others, or that a criminal act has been committed, or if we are required to do so by law or appropriate authority.
How do we protect personal data?
Security is a high priority for us. We take appropriate precautions to protect personal data.
Email and other electronic communications are not secure if they have not been encrypted. Your communications will pass through a number of network nodes before they reach us. So we do not accept responsibility for any unauthorised access to or loss of personal data that stems from a cause beyond our control. Nor can we be held responsible for the actions or omissions of other users or third parties who may misuse your personal data which they collect from the website.
To whom do we disclose personal data?
If you complete a job application, your application form, CV and other details will be made available to relevant recruiters, who may contact you.
We may allow access to your personal data by third parties who supply us with a service. Examples include e-commerce platform providers, website hosts, content delivery networks and businesses which assist us in undertaking communications or monitoring our website.
Any information which you enter into your profile (including your full name and age) plus any photo plus any post you make on our website will be available to and searchable by users of our website.
We may disclose personal data so far as reasonably necessary:
if we have reason to believe that it breaches our terms and conditions, or that such steps are necessary to protect us or others, or that a criminal act has been committed, or if there has been a complaint about content posted by you, or if we are required to do so by law or appropriate authority; or
in the case of an actual or proposed (including negotiations for a) sale or merger or business combination involving all or the relevant part of our business.
We may store or transfer personal data outside the European Economic Area (EEA) for the purposes stated in this policy. If so, we will of course comply with the applicable laws relating to data transfer outside the EEA.
Except as otherwise specifically included in this policy, this document addresses only the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. If you disclose your information to third parties, whether they are suppliers of services on our or other websites, different rules will apply to their use or disclosure of your information. Please check their privacy policies carefully.
How can you access and rectify personal data?
You have the right to request personal data that we hold about you, subject to us reserving the right to withhold such data to the extent permitted by law. We may charge an administration fee in line with data protection laws and we may also require appropriate evidence of identity. Note that you may be able to rectify certain of your personal data within your account on our service (if applicable).
For information about your rights under UK data protection laws, see the website of the UK Information Commissioner.
