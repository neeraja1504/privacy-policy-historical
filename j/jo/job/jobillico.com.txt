Privacy policy
The Internet is an extraordinary tool. It has the power to change how we live and Jobillico recognizes this potential. For us, it is important to help our users and members protect their privacy while taking advantage of all of the benefits the Internet has to offer.
Our “Privacy Policy” applies to all our Internet users and is a complement to Jobillico’s “Terms of Use.” To protect your privacy, Jobillico adheres to various principles in keeping with global practices pertaining to protecting customers’ privacy and electronic documents. We recommend that you read the policy on the confidentiality of electronic documents carefully and regularly. Changes may be made to this Policy, as Jobillico reserves the right to modify, add to and improve its privacy policy.

All your personal financial information is managed by PayPal or Desjardins according to its terms of use. Only your personal information, such as the package purchased, purchase amount, and first and last names, are transmitted to us by PayPal or Desjardins using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) to enable us to generate your invoice.

Registration and password protection
Once you have registered on Jobillico.com, you will receive a message in your inbox confirming your registration. To activate your account, you must click on the link in this email or copy/paste it into the address bar of your Internet browser, which will automatically redirect you to our website. Under no circumstances, will we confirm your password by email. If you receive a message of this nature, do not reply for your own protection, as this email could be an attempt at phishing. We have no control over the confidentiality of your personal information distributed by you or by third parties through other Internet sites.
Consent
If you choose not to register or provide personal information, you can continue to use Jobillico.com. However, you will not be able to access areas that require registration.
Personal information in your curriculum vitae
When posting your online curriculum vitae (CV) on Jobillico.com, we require your telephone number in addition to the mandatory information indicated. Additional personal information included in your online CV serves to describe your skills, experience and job preferences. It is not necessary to indicate in your online CV certain confidential and personal information about your private life, political or religious beliefs or ethnicity.
Your online CV allows you to receive job postings only if you authorize employers and recruiters to access your CV. Jobillico has established strict security measures and rigorously protects the privacy of your personal information and respects how you choose this information to be used. We carefully protect your data from any loss, inappropriate use, unauthorized access or disclosure, modification or destruction. Though our CV bank can be accessed solely by users who pay registration fees, we cannot guarantee or be held liable for the conduct of a third party.
You can remove your online CV from Jobillico.com at any time. Your personal information will remain stored on our servers for a certain period of time in the event that you should decide to use our services again, or for our protection in the event of litigation.
When entering your personal information, you are free to answer or ignore fields marked “optional.” However, the fields marked “optional” that have not been completed could limit the customized services available to you.
Access to your personal information
We have provided means for ensuring the accuracy of your personal information. You will have the option of editing or updating this information at any time from your virtual office. In particular:
You can view, modify or update the personal information already provided.
You can register. Once you have registered, you will no longer have to provide us with your information. Your information will accompany you wherever you go on Jobillico.com.
Security
PayPal and Desjardins guarantees the security of your e-commerce transactions according to their terms of use for all transactions made using a credit card or any other method. You will be required to use a 256-bit encrypted password whenever you wish to access information in your personal account.
Your personal information will never be shared with other users without your explicit authorization, except under the conditions stipulated below in the paragraph “Use of personal information.” Our company stores data on a limited-access server protected by a password. Your information is stored or processed in Québec where Jobillico, its representatives, agents and employees are located.
You also have an important role to play in protecting your personal information. No one can view or modify your personal information without your user name and password. It is therefore important to keep this information confidential. Jobillico cannot be held liable for possible damages caused by the disclosure of information transmitted over the Internet, given that it is impossible to guarantee absolute security. Please be vigilant.
Message for parents
Dear parents and guardians: we want to help you protect your child’s privacy. We recommend that you show your children how to safely and responsibly use their personal information when using the Internet.
Jobillico’s Jobillico.com website is not intended for children under 18 years of age. However, it is not forbidden for adolescents to register and post their CV. If you have concerns about the fact that your children or adolescents are providing personal information on the Internet with your consent, you must provide them with all the necessary safety advice and tips so that they are protected against fraud, harassment or criminal acts that could occur due to a lack of vigilance when using the Internet. If you are a victim of fraud in any form, it is your responsibility to report the incident to the police.
