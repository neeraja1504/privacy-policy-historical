Privacy Policy - Jumia Travel
Bookings: We use the information you give us to manage your bookings, and to share some of it with the accommodation provider so that they know who to expect.
Customer Service: Giving the best customer service possible is very important to us. We use your information to make sure we serve you as well as we can. If we work with 3rd parties as part of our customer service we may share your information with them (e.g. if you ask us to book transport for you)
Account administration and personalisation: We link all of your bookings to your account, using your information and booking history to allow you to manage your account in the most user friendly way possible. We may use this information to personalise your account and the way our website looks to you, to ensure it’s as relevant to your needs as possible.
Guest reviews: We’ll use your information to contact you following a stay, asking you to rate the accommodation and our website to help future visitors to Travel.jumia.com.
Marketing activities: We may use your information and booking history to send you newsletters and special offers relevant to you via email, sms and push notifications. Of course, you can choose to opt out of these at any time. We may also use this information to show a customised selection of offers and accommodation to you when you use our services. From time to time, we may contact you by phone to suggest offers we think would be of interest to you. We sometimes ask our customers to take part in market research. If you do so, any personal information gathered as part of the research will only be used with your consent.
Other communications: There may be other times when we need to get in touch with you for specific reasons and will use your information in order to do this. Examples of this include: responding to specific requests or direct communications from you; contacting you to finalise, confirm or change a booking; asking you to review our services or those of our accommodation partners.
Fraud detection and prevention: We are committed to keeping Travel.jumia.com as safe and secure as possible. To help us do that we may use your information for the detection and prevention of fraud, and other unwanted activities.
Improving our services: We constantly analyse the way people use our services to improve our offering and the customer experience. To do this we use your information and data on how you use our services.
