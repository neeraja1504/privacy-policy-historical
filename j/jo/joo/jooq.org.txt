Data Geekery GmbH operates several websites including datageekery.com and jooq.org. It is Data Geekery GmbH's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.
Website Visitors
Like most website operators, Data Geekery GmbH collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Data Geekery GmbH's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Data Geekery GmbH's visitors use its website. From time to time, Data Geekery GmbH may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website. Data Geekery GmbH also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on the Data Geekery GmbH Blog. Data Geekery GmbH only discloses logged in users under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.

Lastly, they may disclose your Personal Information if required to do so by process of law, or if necessary in order to investigate fraud, a violation of the Site Terms of Use or in connection with any harm being caused to a third party or their rights. They may use and disclose non-personal information for any number of reasons and with any number of third parties. Please note that Disqus may change its privacy policy, and verify the current privacy policy from the Disqus site.
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to Data Geekery GmbH's websites choose to interact with Data Geekery GmbH in ways that require Data Geekery GmbH to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Data Geekery GmbH gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we may ask visitors who sign up for an account at jooq.org or datageekery.com to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Data Geekery GmbH – by purchasing a subscription to a Data Geekery GmbH service, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Data Geekery GmbH collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfil the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Data Geekery GmbH. Data Geekery GmbH does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
Data Geekery GmbH discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Data Geekery GmbH's behalf or to provide services available at Data Geekery GmbH's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Data Geekery GmbH's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Data Geekery GmbH will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Data Geekery GmbH discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Data Geekery GmbH believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Data Geekery GmbH, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Data Geekery GmbH website and have supplied your email address, Data Geekery GmbH may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Data Geekery GmbH and our products. We primarily use our product blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Data Geekery GmbH takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
