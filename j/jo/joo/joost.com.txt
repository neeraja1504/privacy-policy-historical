Information We Collect
Registration and Your Personal Profile
When you register with the Site or the Service, you provide us with certain personal information, such as a username (which may or may not be your real name), email address, gender, zip/postal code and date of birth. The decision to provide this information is optional. However, if you choose not provide the requested information, you may not be able to use certain features of the Site or Services.

Certain third parties will also place and read cookies in your browser. Further information on this can be found below in the section "Third Parties Who Collect And Receive Your Information".

Slurping
You will have the opportunity to connect with friends from your other networks, such as AOL, Gmail, LinkedIn, Hotmail, Netlog and Yahoo.
The Site will identify the email addresses of the friends in your other networks, and if any of these friends are already Joost® users, we will offer you the opportunity to connect as friends on Joost®, and if you choose to do so, a friend request will be sent by email. If any of your friends are not Joost® users, we will enable you to invite those friends to join Joost®. You will be able to select those friends in your other networks that you wish to invite (if any), and Joost will send one email on your behalf to each of these friends inviting them to visit the Site and register as a Joost® user. If any of your friends respond to your invitation, and subsequently register as Joost® users, you will offered the opportunity to connect as friends on Joost®. If you choose to connect, a friend request will be sent by email.
After this process is complete, and any email invitation(s) have been sent, your friends' email addresses will be deleted from our servers (unless they have registered separately as Joost® users). We will not retain or use these email addresses for any purpose whatsoever, and will not contact your friends or create any connections unless you ask us to.
If your email address appears in anyone else's network, Joost may use your email address for the purposes described above.
