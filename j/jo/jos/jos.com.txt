2. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION

JOS may collect, use, and disclose the information it collects for a variety of reasons, including for the following purposes:
Marketing and Promotions. To communicate news and promotions to you relating to JOS related products and services and other products and services we think may be of interest to you, and to operate sweepstakes, contests, or other marketing or promotional activities (you can opt out anytime by updating us as to your preference).
Internal Business Purposes. For our internal business purposes, such as data analysis, audits, developing new products, enhancing the website, improving our services, identifying usage trends and visiting patterns, determining the effectiveness of our promotions, and meeting contractual obligations.
Response to Inquiries. We may process information contained in or relating to any communication that you send to us ("correspondence data"). The correspondence data may include the communication content and metadata associated with the communication. The correspondence data may be processed for the purposes of communicating with you and record-keeping.

Additional Uses. We may also use your data in other ways as described to you when you provide such information to us.
The legal grounds for processing your personal information consists of one or more of the following: (i) your consent, and/or (ii) providing the services you have requested, and/or (iii) compliance with applicable laws, regulations, court orders or other legal process.
3. SHARING INFORMATION
In order to provide you with the best experience, your personal information may be shared with the following parties insofar as reasonably necessary for the purposes, and on the legal grounds, set out in this policy:
to third parties not affiliated with JOS when we have your consent to do so;
to our trusted business partners to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures;
to our marketing and advertisement partners to provide you with more-relevant ads on our site and to encourage you to return to our site;
to third parties not affiliated with JOS if we have a good-faith belief that it is reasonably necessary to: (1) meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request; (2) enforce applicable terms of service, including investigation of potential violations; (3) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues;
to any third parties to the extent necessary with respect to a sale of all or part of our business operations or assets; and
to any courts, law enforcement bodies or governmental authorities in order to comply with our legal obligations and respond to any claims asserted against us. We will only disclose information to the extent we are legally obligated to.
4. INFORMATION TRANSFER
JOS is an international corporation, and therefore we may need to share your information internally with subsidiary and/or associated companies within our group and externally with third party service providers and developers for the purposes and activities specified in this Privacy Policy. This may involve information being collected within the European Economic Area being transferred to countries outside of the European Economic Area, including the United States, although such transfers will always be limited to the purposes and activities specified in this Privacy Policy. Your information may therefore be subject to privacy laws that are different from those in your country of residence.
We will take reasonable steps, such as entering into data transfer agreements based on the European Commission model clauses, or requiring compliance with the EU-US Privacy Shield to ensure that while your personal information is within our control, we will handle your personal information using reasonable security and confidentiality procedures to keep your personal information secure and confidential.
5. INFORMATION SECURITY
We implement reasonable administrative, organisational and technical safeguards and security measures to protect personal information within our control from unauthorized access, acquisition, disclosure, destruction or alteration, accidental loss, misuse or damage. We regularly review and monitor such safeguards and security measures.
However, no security measures can ever be completely secure, therefore we cannot guarantee that these measures will stop any users who try to get around the privacy or security settings on the JOS website through unforeseen and/or illegal means.
In the event that we believe that the security of your personal information in our possession or control may have been compromised or could be at risk, we will seek to notify you as promptly as possible. If we have your e-mail address, we may notify you by e-mail.
6. HOW LONG WILL THE INFORMATION BE KEPT
To the extent permissible by applicable law, we will retain your personal information for such periods as necessary in order to satisfy or to fulfill the following:
the purposes for which that personal information was provided,
an identifiable and ongoing business need, including record keeping,
a specific legal or regulatory requirement, and/or
a requirement to retain records that may be relevant to any notified regulatory investigations or active legal proceedings.
Where there is no sufficient justification to retain such personal information, such personal information will be safely and securely deleted, disposed of, anonymised and/or blocked.
