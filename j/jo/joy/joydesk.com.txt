This Joydesk Privacy Policy (this “Privacy Policy”) covers the treatment of personally identifiable information that Joydesk, LLC, a Washington limited liability company (“Joydesk”) collects when you use the Joydesk network of websites and/or our mobile services. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Joydesk does not own or control, or to people that Joydesk does not employ or manage.
Information Collection
Joydesk collects personally identifiable information when you register for a Joydesk account, when you use certain Joydesk products or services, when you visit Joydesk pages, and when you enter promotions or sweepstakes.
Once you register with Joydesk and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us. You will also select an ID and password that you will use to login to the Joydesk services. For your protection, we recommend not using personal information, such as your name or mobile phone number.
Joydesk may also automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, Joydesk cookie information, and the page you requested. Joydesk uses information for three general purposes: to customize the advertising and content you see, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, and to contact you about Joydesk and third party specials and new products.
Information Sharing and Disclosure
We may disclose information that is collected about you to our affiliated and non-affiliated third-parties for purposes of marketing and to provide you with offers as to products they feel may be in furtherance of your interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Joydesk may sell and/or transfer your personally identifiable information to an affiliate and to any successor-in-interest as a result of a sale of any part of Joydesk's business or upon the merger, reorganization, or consolidation of Joydesk with another entity on a basis that Joydesk is not the surviving entity. For the purposes of this paragraph, "affiliate" means any person directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with Joydesk. The term "control," as used in the immediately preceding sentence, shall mean with respect to any person, the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power, through the exercise of voting rights, contractual rights, or otherwise, to direct or cause the direction of the management or policies of the controlled person. As used in this Privacy Policy, the term "person" includes any natural person, corporation, partnership, limited liability company, trust, unincorporated association or any other entity.
Joydesk will send personally identifiable information about you to other companies or people when:
We have your consent to share the information;
We need to send the information to companies who work on behalf of Joydesk to provide a product or service to you (unless we tell you differently, these companies do not have any right to use the personally identifiable information we provide to them beyond what is necessary to assist us);
We respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process; or
We find that your actions violate the Joydesk Terms of Use, the Privacy Policy, or any of our usage guidelines for specific products or services.
Third Party Cookies
In the course of serving advertisements to users of our services, a third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser.
Cookies
Joydesk may, in its sole discretion, set and access Joydesk cookies on your computer and/or mobile device.
Joydesk allows other companies that are presenting advertisements on some of our pages to set and access their cookies on your computer and/or mobile device. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Advertisers or other companies do not have access to Joydesk cookies.
Joydesk may, in its sole discretion, use web beacons (electronic images called a "single-pixel GIF" or "web beacon") that allow a web site to count users who have visited that page or to access certain cookies) to access our cookies within our network of web sites and in connection with Joydesk products and services
In addition to the information collected by us and registration information submitted by you, we may employ both first-party and third-party cookies. A cookie is a piece of data stored on your hard drive containing activity-based information about you, and it is designed to facilitate the receipt of targeted and relevant advertisements. The cookie is not associated with your personally identifiable information.

Other Use of Your Information
Joydesk may use your personally identifiable information to send you information and updates via e-mail regarding your account with Joydesk and the services that Joydesk offers.
Joydesk may use your personally identifiable information to send you information via e-mail regarding products and services offered by third parties, but only if you elect to receive such information.
Use of Joydesk Services by Minors
The Joydesk services are not directed to children under the age of 13. You must be at least 13 years of age to sign up or use the Joydesk services and each user who signs up or uses the Joydesk services represents to Joydesk that they are at least 13 years of age.
The Joydesk services are available to people at least 13 years of age, but if you are between 13 and 18 years of age, you agree that you have received parental or guardian permission to provide personal information to the Joydesk services and to order and pay for any products or service through the Joydesk services.

Security
Joydesk follows generally accepted industry standards to protect all personal information sent to us, both during the transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while Joydesk strives to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
