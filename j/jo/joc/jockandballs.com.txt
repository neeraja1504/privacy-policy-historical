1. INTRODUCTION
1.1. Purpose of Policy
Comedy.com, LLC (“us,” “we,” or “Company”) is committed to respecting the privacy rights of its customers, visitors, and other users of its website located at http://comedy.com (the “Site”). We created this Website Privacy Policy (this “Policy”) to give you confidence as you visit and use the Site, and to demonstrate our commitment to fair information practices and the protection of privacy. This Policy is only applicable to the Site, and not to any other websites that you may be able to access from the Site, each of which may have data collection and use practices and policies that differ materially from this Policy.
1.2. Notice Concerning Children
We are a general audience site, and do not direct any of our content specifically at children under 13 years of age. In addition, you must be at least 14 years of age in order to set up an account and obtain a user ID with us. We understand and are committed to respecting the sensitive nature of children’s privacy online. If we learn or have reason to suspect that a Site user is under age 13, or that any registered user is under the age of 14, we will promptly delete that user’s account, including any personal information that might be stored in that user’s account. We also strongly recommend that minors between the ages of 14 and 18 get permission from a parent or guardian before using the Site and before sending any information about themselves over the Internet.
2. INFORMATION COLLECTION PRACTICES
2.1. Basic Information We Collect
(a) USER PROFILE INFORMATION. We collect a variety of user-submitted information such as names, ages, and email addresses, in order to establish and authenticate user accounts and to send information and notices to our users regarding the Site and the services we offer. We may also collect descriptive information about users, which can include gender, occupation, employer, education, schools attended, likes, dislikes and other interests, and we may make this information available so that users can find others with similar traits and shared interests.

In addition to the foregoing, in operating the Site, we may include registration, online surveys, and other online forms that ask users to provide their names, e-mail addresses, and other contact information, as well as information related to the subject matter of the activities requiring registration, of the surveys or of the other online forms. Users may also have the opportunity to post photos and videos, maintain a blog or other form of online journal, and share other materials about themselves, their friends, families and colleagues. Users will have some ability to control access to these user-provided materials, and to prevent the Site from making these materials accessible to all other users.
2.2. Additional Information We Collect
(a) AUTOMATIC COLLECTION. Our servers automatically recognize visitors’ domain names and IP addresses (the number assigned to computers on the Internet). No personal information about you is revealed in this process. The Site may also gather anonymous “traffic data” that does not personally identify you, but that may be helpful for marketing purposes or for improving the services we offer.
(b) COOKIES. From time to time, we may use the standard “cookies” feature of major browser applications that allows us to store a small piece of data on your computer about your visit to the Site.
