other relevant information and may allow you to use the applicable application on your phone. The
sending of SMS notifications may be handled through a third party service provider.
With your consent, we may send push notifications to your mobile device to provide application

our online services, or to register for other Juxta products or services, we will collect the
information that you disclose and analyze the data to discover new facts that could help us better
understand our products and services. We may use this information for our internal business
purposes, such as research to improve our products and analyses that may help us better market our
products.

boards and promote application user achievements, to solicit input and feedback to improve our
products and services, and to inform users about new products or promotional offers.
Sharing Your Information
We may share your personal information, with third parties in the following circumstances:
Some of your profile information may be exposed publicly when you participate in the Services such as
by posting content, chatting with other users, or commenting on content. This includes: your name,
profile photos, username, school or network name, bio and descriptions of your activity.
Your information and your online communications may be accessed and monitored as necessary to
provide the Services and may be disclosed or reported: (i) if we have a good faith belief that we are
required to disclose the information by law, (ii) in response to legal process (for example, a court order,
search warrant or subpoena); (ii) to satisfy applicable laws, (iii) if we believe that the Services are being
used to commit a crime, (iii) including, but not limited to, to report such criminal activity or to
exchange information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection and
credit risk reduction, (iv) if we have a good faith belief that there is an emergency that poses a threat to
the health or safety of a person or the general public, and (v) in order to protect the rights or property of
Juxta, including to enforce our Terms of Service.
If you give us your consent, we may actively share personal information with third party advertisers for
their direct marketing purposes. We may share aggregated or anonymous information and certain
technical information to develop and deliver targeted advertising in the Services and on the websites of
third parties. We may also allow advertisers to collect those types of information within the Services
and they may share it with us. We may use this information for behavioral advertising and for web
analytics. Our collection, use, and disclosure of anonymous or aggregated information are not subject to
any of the restrictions in this privacy policy.
We may display an “offer wall” that is hosted by an offer wall provider. The offer wall allows third
party advertisers to provide virtual currency to users in exchange for interacting with an advertisement
or for completing a marketing offer that may include signing up for an account with one of those
advertisers. These are not offers made by us. We may display these offers to you based on certain
information, such as your geographic area or anonymous demographic information. If you click on one
of these advertisements, you will no longer be on a site hosted by Juxta or a partnering SNS.
We may provide your information to third party companies to perform services on our behalf, including
payment processing, data analysis, message delivery, hosting services, customer service, and marketing.
If we sell all or a portion of our business, we may transfer all of your information, including personal
information, to the successor organization.
Security of Your Information
We implement security measures we believe are reasonable to protect your information. It is
important that you protect and maintain the security of your account and you need to immediately
notify us of any unauthorized use of your account. No website, mobile application or Internet
transmission is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data
loss, or other breaches or other type of misuse will never occur. We may post a notice via the Services
if a security breach occurs. We may also send you notice by the contact information you have
provided to us in these circumstances. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to
receive written notice of a data privacy or security breach. If you have reason to believe that your
personal information that we have collected or our Services’ security has been breached, please notify
us by support@juxtalabs.com.
Accessing and Controlling Your Information
If you have accounts on our Services you can access and edit the information you provided to us
through individual settings in the Services. If you want to delete your accounts and information on our
Services, please contact us directly at: support@juxtalabs.com.. To manage the information we receive
about you from an SNS you will need to follow the instructions at that the SNS. Once we receive your
information from an SNS, that information is stored and used by us in accordance with this Privacy
Policy.
Opting Out of Marketing Communications
Similarly, you may opt-out of commercial communications by clicking on the unsubscribe link in an
email or by replying “STOP” to text messages. We will process your requests as soon as possible, but
please be aware that it may take us some time to respond to your request and, in some circumstances
regarding opt-out requests, you may receive a few more messages until your request is processed.
Our Policy Toward Children
Our Services are not intended for children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect any
personal information from such children. Children under the age of 13 should not use our Services at
any time. If we learn that we have collected personally identifiable information from a child under the
age of 13 we will delete such information as quickly as possible.
International Operations and Information Transfer
We may transfer data to foreign affiliates, partners or vendors. If you are located outside of the United
States of America and choose to use our Services and share information with us, we may transfer your
data across borders, and from your country or jurisdiction to the United States or other countries or
jurisdictions around the world, and process it there. If you are visiting from Canada, the European
Union, or other jurisdictions with laws governing data protection that may differ from United States
law, please note that you are transferring your personal information to the United States which does not
have the same data protection laws as your country and which may provide more limited recourse
mechanisms, including dissimilar or, at times, weaker data protection rights. With knowledge of these
risks, by providing your personal information you consent to: (1) the use of your personal information
for the uses identified above in accordance with this Privacy Policy; and (2) the transfer of your
personal information to the United States and other countries as indicated above.
Third Party Apps and Websites
Our Services may link to third-party apps and websites from companies other than Juxta that may link
to their own websites, such as offer wall providers. We are not responsible for the privacy practices,
security, or the content of such websites. If you have any questions about how these other websites use
your information, you should review their policies and contact them directly. We are not responsible for
the actions of third-party advertisers and service providers.
Third Party Advertisers
We may use advertisers, third party ad networks, and other advertising companies to serve
advertisements on the Services. Please be advised that such advertising companies may gather
information about your visit to the Services or other websites (such as through cookies, web beacons,
and other technologies) to enable such advertising companies to market products or services to you, to
monitor which ads have been served to your browser and which webpages you were viewing when such
ads were delivered. If you would like to learn more about this practice, and know your choices with
respect to it, please visit here.
AGAIN, PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS PRIVACY POLICY DOES NOT COVER THE COLLECTION
AND USE OF INFORMATION BY SUCH THIRD PARTY SITES AND ADVERTISERS.
Assignment
In the event that all or part of our assets are sold or acquired by another party, or in the event of a
merger, you grant us the right to assign your personal information collected via the Services.
Changes to Our Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes to our Privacy
Policy, we will notify you and other users by posting the changes on the Juxta Labs Services or by
using the contact information you have on file with us and will indicate when such changes will become
effective. By continuing to use our Services you are agreeing to be bound by any changes or revisions
made to this Privacy Policy.
California Privacy Rights & How We Respond to Do-Not- Track Disclosures
California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits visitors to the Services who are California residents to
request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their
direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please contact us at the address provided at the
bottom of this Privacy Policy.
We do not share personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you
affirmatively agree to such disclosure, typically by “opting in” to receive information from a third party
that is participating in a sweepstakes or other promotion on one of our Services. If you do ask us to
share your personal information with a third party for its marketing purposes, we will only share
information in connection with that specific promotion, as we do not share information with any third
party (other than our service providers) on a continual basis.
At this time our Services do not recognize automated browser signals regarding tracking mechanisms,
which may include ‘do not track’ instructions.
Agreement to Arbitrate
By visiting the Services or otherwise using the Services, you and we agree that, if there is any
controversy, claim, action or dispute arising out of or related to any transaction conducted on the
Services, or the breach, enforcement, interpretation, or validity of the Privacy Policy or any part of them
(collectively, a "Dispute"), both parties shall first try in good faith to settle such Dispute by providing
written notice to the other party describing the facts and circumstances of the Dispute and allowing the
receiving party thirty (30) days in which to respond to or settle the Dispute.
Notice shall be sent:
To Juxta Labs Inc., 525 Brannan St. Suite 408, San Francisco, CA 94107,
ATTN: Legal Department, or
To you at: your contact information that we have on file.
Both you and we agree that this dispute resolution procedure is a condition precedent that must be
satisfied before initiating any litigation or filing any claim against the other party.
IF ANY DISPUTE CANNOT BE RESOLVED BY THE ABOVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURE, YOU AGREE
THAT THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION FOR SUCH DISPUTE WILL BE DECIDED BY BINDING
ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS MEANS THAT YOU
WILL NOT HAVE, AND YOU WAIVE, THE RIGHT FOR A JUDGE OR JURY TO DECIDE YOUR CLAIMS, AND
THAT YOU MAY NOT PROCEED IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY. Other rights
that you and we would have in court will not be available or will be more limited in arbitration, including
discovery and appeal rights. All such Disputes shall be determined by arbitration in the San Francisco,
CA area, exclusively submitted to JAMS (www.jamsadr.com) for binding arbitration under its rules then
in effect, before one arbitrator to be mutually agreed upon by both parties.
The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve
any dispute arising under or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of
the Privacy Policy, including any claim that all or any part of the Privacy Policy is void or voidable.
