A message from the jog.fm team
We're people just like you. We care about our privacy, we hate pop-up and pop-under ads, we despise spam , we dislike obligatory registrations, and we really don't like insecure websites. We spent a lot of time making sure our site was secure, and as private as you'd like it to be. We have, and will continue to reject distasteful, or otherwise "sketchy" ads. We'll never spam, or distribute your email address to anyone. And more importantly, we've built the site so you can use most of the functionality without an account.
If you have any questions or concerns about the privacy of this site, please contact us. We're willing to go well out of our way to make sure you have a safe, enjoyable experience on our site.

Privacy Policy
Blendist LLC ("Blendist", "we", "our", or "us") owns or controls, and provides users ("Users") access to the web pages located at jog.fm, and the associated subdomains including but not limited to walk.jog.fm, cycle.jog.fm, and ride.jog.fm (the "Website"), and all proprietary services, software, mobile applications, data and materials accessed via the Website (the "Services"). The Website and the Services are referred to together in this Privacy Policy as the "Properties".
Your privacy and security are some of our top concerns. Accordingly, we have developed this Privacy Policy (the "Policy") in order for you to understand how we collect, use, communicate and disclose and make use of personal information. The following outlines the Policy.
1. Audience
Children under the age of 13 are not eligible to use our Properties and must not attempt to register with the Properties and/or submit any personal information. We do not knowingly collect personal information from any person who is under the age of 13 or allow them to register. If it comes to our attention that we have collected personal data from a person under the age of 13, we will remove this information as quickly as possible. If you have reason to believe that this has occurred, please contact us at legal@jog.fm, and we will delete all relevant information.
Persons between the ages of 13 and 17 should not send any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet without asking for parental/legal guardian permission beforehand.
2. Revisions to the Policy

While we make a concerted effort to provide access to as many features of the Properties as possible without requiring personal information, some features (such as playlist creation) require user registration. When registering you will be asked to provide an email address and create a username and password. You may also choose to create a more detailed profile of yourself on the Properties by submitting additional personal information. Your username and additional personal information will be publicly visible to Users of the Properties. We will never publish or display your email address, unless it is used as your username. Please note that if you choose a username that includes or reveals your real name, email address, or any other personal information, such information may be available to other Users of the Properties and to the general public.
If you choose to purchase music or other goods or services by clicking on a third party link provided on the Website (e.g. a link to iTunes or Amazon.com), such third party may collect your personal details for the purpose of completing a transaction (e.g. credit card number). We may be provided with confirmation of your transactions with such third parties and, in some instances, such confirmation may include your personal information. Aside from such confirmations, the only information that we will collect with respect to such third party links is: (a) the number of Users who utilized such links; and (b) the number of purchases made by these Users.
Where you upload photographs or other content as part of your user profile, you should be aware that Blendist is entitled to use those photographs and content in accordance with our Terms of Use.

5. Use of Personal Information
We will not sell or distribute your email address or any other personal information to any third parties.
We may use the email address that you provided when you registered to contact you from time to time.
