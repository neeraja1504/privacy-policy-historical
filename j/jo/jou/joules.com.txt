Security: We respect the security of your data and treat it in accordance with the law.
International: We may transfer your personal information outside the EU and, if we do, you can expect a similar degree of protection in respect of your personal information.

18. Where you enter one of our stores, your image may be recorded by our CCTV cameras. CCTV footage may be used in order to ensure the security and safety of our staff and customers and could potentially be used as evidence in an investigation or civil or criminal legal proceedings.
Placing an order or a request for information
1. Many of the services that we offer are only made available if we have certain information about you. To access these services, you will, from time to time, be asked to submit personal data about yourself. If you do not provide that personal data, we will not be able to offer those services to you. For example, if you do not provide information about your method of payment or delivery address, we will not be able to complete your order with us.
Use of the Joules Sites
2. If you do not agree for us to your personal information when you access the Joules Site, you should not use the Joules Sites.
1. We will comply with data protection law. At the heart of data protection laws are the "data protection principles" which say that the personal information we hold about you must be:
1. used lawfully, fairly and in a transparent way;
2. collected only for valid purposes that we have clearly explained to you and not used in any way that is incompatible with those purposes;
3. relevant to the purposes we have told you about and limited only to those purposes;
4. accurate and kept up to date;
5. kept only as long as necessary for the purposes we have told you about; and
6. kept securely.
1. In accordance with the data protection laws, we need a "lawful basis" for collecting and using information about you. There are a variety of different legal bases for using personal data which are set out in the data protection laws.
2. The lawful bases on which we rely in order to use the information which we collect about you for the purposes set out in this statement will be:
1. **Contract:** Using your information will be necessary for us to either perform the contract between us or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into the contract;
2. **Legal compliance:** Using your information will be necessary for us to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation which is placed on Joules;
3. **Legitimate interest:** Using your information will be necessary for our legitimate commercial interest and our interest is not outweighed by the potential impact on your privacy. For example, we rely on legitimate interest as our lawful basis to send you marketing information by email or by post if you have placed an order with us and you have not objected to receiving such marketing information. **If you would prefer not to receive marketing information from us, please email us at[joulesteam@joules.com](mailto:joulesteam@joules.com);**
4. **Consent:** It is possible that you may give us your consent to use your information for a particular purpose.
1. We may share some of your personal data with third parties as described below.
Sharing your information within the Joules group
2. We may disclose your personal information to any member of our group, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries, as defined in section 1159 of the UK Companies Act 2006.
3. We will share your personal information with other entities in our group as part of our regular reporting activities on company performance, in the context of a business reorganisation or group restructuring exercise, for system maintenance support and hosting of data.
Sharing your information with third parties
4. We may also share your personal information with third parties, such as:
1. To our nominated third party carriers to enable them to deliver your order and to contact you if there is a problem with delivery (i.e. telephone, name and address only);
2. To our nominated marketing agencies who provide marketing services on our behalf;
3. To registered credit reference or fraud prevention agencies who may retain and use your personal information; or
4. To third party companies who are co-hosting a competition and you have consented to that transfer.
1. We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal information from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal information to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal information on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
2. **We will never ask you to confirm or supply any account or credit card details via email or text message.** If you receive such an email or text message, please do not respond and notify us immediately at: [joulesteam@joules.com](mailto:joulesteam@joules.com).
3. All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology. When you proceed to make your purchase and your browser connects to the secure section of a Joules Site your browser window frame will show a padlock icon to indicate that you are entering a secure area.
4. If you are using a computer or other device to access the Joules Sites in a public location we recommend that you always log out and close the website browser down when you complete an online session for your security.
5. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.
6. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.
Third parties security measures
7. Third parties will only process your personal information on our instructions and where they have agreed to treat the information confidentially and to keep it secure.
8. All our third-party service providers and other entities in the group are required to take appropriate security measures to protect your personal information in line with our policies. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes. We only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.
1. The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff may be engaged in, amongst other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. **By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing.** We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy statement.
2. We will transfer the personal information we collect about you to the following countries outside the EU in order to perform our contract with you:
1. USA, Australia
2. There is an adequacy decision by the European Commission in respect of those countries listed above with an asterix (*). This means that those countries are deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for your personal information.
3. For the remaining countries which do not have an adequacy decision from the European Commission, we have put in place the following appropriate measures to ensure that your personal information is treated by those third parties in a way that is consistent with and which respects the EU and UK laws on data protection:
1. The third party organisations based in the US are each subject to the US/EU Privacy Shield. This means that both organisations are part of a scheme which is designed to protect your personal information. As a result, we are not required to obtain specific authorisation to transfer your information to the US.
2. Standard data protection clauses in the form of template transfer clauses adopted by the European Commission.
4. If you require further information about these protective measures, you can request it from the Data Protection Officer.
1. We typically will only use your personal information for the purposes for which we collect it. In limited circumstances we may use your information for a purpose other than those set out in this policy. If we intend to do so, we will provide you with information relating to that other purpose before using it for the new purpose.
2. We may use your personal information without your knowledge or consent where such use is required or permitted by law.
1. The Joules Sites may contain links to third party websites. If you follow a link to any such website, please note that your use of such website will be subject to the terms of that website’s privacy policy and we do not accept responsibility or liability for your use of such website. Please check the terms of the third party website’s privacy policy before submitting any personal data to such a website.
1. The Joules Sites use cookies to distinguish you from other users of the Joules Sites. This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse the Joules Sites and also allows us to improve the Joules Sites. For detailed information on the cookies we use and the purposes for which we use them see our [Website Cookie Policy](https://www.joules.com/cookie-policy).
1. We will only retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. Details of retention periods for different aspects of your personal information are available in our retention policy which is available from our Data Protection Officer.
2. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
3. In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal information so that it can no longer be associated with you, in which case we may use such information without further notice to you.
1. If you have any questions about our use of your personal data, you are welcome to contact us. You will find our contact details at the bottom of this page. If you notice any errors in your personal data, you have the right to have them corrected.
2. Under certain circumstances, by law you have the right to:
1. **Request access** to your personal information (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
2. **Request correction** of the personal information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected.
3. **Request erasure** of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below).
4. **Object to processing** of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground. **You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes.**
5. **Request the restriction of processing** of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal information about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.
6. **Request the transfer** of your personal information to another party.
You are not always entitled to exercise each of these rights. The rights which you are entitled to exercise depend on a number of factors including the lawful basis on which we rely to use your personal data. Therefore, if you make a request to exercise a right which is not available to you, we have the right to decline the request.
7. If you want to review, verify, correct or request erasure of your personal information, object to the processing of your personal data, or request that we transfer a copy of your personal information to another party, please contact [joulesteam@joules.com](mailto:joulesteam@joules.com) in writing.
1. In the limited circumstances where you may have provided your consent to the collection, processing and transfer of your personal information for a specific purpose, you have the right to withdraw your consent for that specific processing at any time. To withdraw your consent, please contact joulesteam@joules.com. Once we have received notification that you have withdrawn your consent, we will no longer process your information for the purpose or purposes you originally agreed to, unless we have another legitimate basis for doing so in law.
1. You also have the right to complain to the Information Commissioner's Office (the "ICO") if you are not satisfied with the way we use your information. You can contact the ICO by writing to Information Commissioner's Office, Wycliffe House, Water Lane, Wilmslow, Cheshire, SK9 5AF.
1. We may amend this privacy policy at any time so please review it frequently and at least each time you submit personal information to us. The date at the top of this page will be amended each time this policy is updated. Our current privacy policy applies to all information that we have about you and your account.
