What are Clear GIFs?
Clear GIFs (also known as web beacons) are used in combination with cookies to help Site operators understand how visitors interact with their websites. A clear gif is typically a transparent graphic image (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel) that is placed on a site. The use of a clear gif allows the Site to measure the actions of the visitor opening the page that contains the clear gif.
How We Use Clear GIFs
We utilize clear GIFs to measure visitor behavior, to help us improve visitor experience, and to manage site content. We, and our Subsidiaries, may use clear GIFs on this Site, in our e-mails, in our advertisements on other web sites, or in our advertisements in others' e-mails.

Security
The Site has physical, administrative, and technical measures in place to maintain the security, confidentiality, and integrity of the data under our control, and to help protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of such data. For example, when the Site is accessed using Netscape Navigator, Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 5.0, or higher, Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology protects information using both server authentication and data encryption to help ensure that the data is safe, secure, and available only to our customers and us. In addition, we use secured server areas and advanced firewall technology to minimize the risk of security breaches for individually identifiable information that is volunteered on the Site. Finally, we provide unique usernames and passwords that must be entered each time a customer, or one of our employees that has a business need to access the information, logs on to one of our products via the Site. These safeguards help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and help ensure the appropriate use of all data.
While we strive to protect your personal information, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be totally secure and therefore we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you send to us. You send any information via the Site at your own risk.
