JFrog (“ JFrog “,“ us ” or “ we ”) respects the privacy of its customers, partners and visitors to its Websites (as defined below)  (“ User ” or “ you ”). We are committed to protecting the personal information that you share with us. We believe that you have a right to know how and why we collect your information and to know what measures we take to protect it. This Privacy Policy is intended on providing you with such information. We have taken efforts to make our Privacy Policy as clear and informative as possible and we encourage you to carefully read it.
By accessing and/or using our Websites and Services you agree to the terms and conditions set forth in this Privacy Policy (the  “Privacy Policy” ), including to the collection and processing of your personal information. ** ** Please note that this Privacy policy applies to the information provided by you through our websites that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “ Websites ”), through our services/products or as you may otherwise interact with us (including, for example, by attending events and meetups) (collectively, “Services”). In case you disagree to any of these terms please do not provide us with any Personal Identifiable Information (as defined below).
1. What information do we collect?
We collect two types of data and information from our Users:
The first type of information is non-identifiable and anonymous information (“ Non-Identifiable Information ”). Non-Identifiable Information is any information that does not enable the identification of an individual. This kind of information is made available to us while you enter and/or use the Websites or the Services. Non-Identifiable information consists of technical information and behavioral information, and includes, among other things, the type of browser you use and the actions you take on the Websites or by using the Services, date/time stamp, referring/exit pages, clicked pages and any other information your browser may send us.
The second type of information that is collected, either alone or in combination with other information, is information that could identify an individual ( “Personal Identifiable Information ” or “ PII ”). PII may include your Internet Protocol Address, first and last name, email or physical address and phone number.
At all times, you may choose whether to provide or disclose PII. If you choose not to provide PII, you may still visit parts of the Websites or receive limited Services, but you may be unable to access certain options, programs, offers, and services that involve our interaction with you.
2. How your information is collected – and the lawful basis for that collection
Non-Identifiable Information is collected when you access or use the Websites and/or the Services. We use industry standard tools and software to monitor your navigation and usage of the Websites and services, your usage pattern-logs and other communications data. We may also use “cookies” and Flash (or similar technologies), which stores certain information on your computer (“ Local Storage ”) and which allows us to enable automatic activation of certain features and improve your experience. It is easy to prohibit Local Storage, most browsers will allow you to erase cookies from your hard drive, block acceptance of cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. To erase or disable the Local Storage option in Flash you should use the settings option of Flash according to the specific instructions provided by the technology provider. However, if you block or erase cookies, or change the settings of Flash, your online experience may be limited.
We also collect information that you provide us voluntarily, for example, we collect PII when you:
File an online form on one of our Websites
Provide us with information at a live event
Register for our services and making payments
Post materials, participating in online forums or providing comments and feedback to online discussions on our Websites
Contacting us by email
Register (directly or indirectly) to any of our events
In addition, we may receive your PII from your employer
Your personal data is stored by us on our servers and on the servers of various cloud-based database management services we engage, located in the United States and the European Union (“ EU ”). We will only collect and process personal data about you when we have a lawful basis to do so. Such basis includes your consent, a contract between us and you or a third party you are associated with, as well as other legitimate interests (for example: our compliant with applicable law, protecting the security of ours and our customers’ systems and data, and enable our services).
3. How we use the information collected?
We collect each type of information for different purposes.
Non-Identifiable Information is collected to allow enhancement of your experience on the Websites and Services, for statistical and research purposes and for customization and improvement of our various interfaces. It also helps us learn about the preferences of our users and general trends relating to the Websites and Services.
PII is collected to:
Enable use of the Services. For example, in order to register to the Services you will need to provide us with your name and email so we will be able to issue a license key.
Allow us to contact you (in accordance with applicable law) with proposals and tailored information regarding new products, events, offers, services, features, enhancements, special offers, upgrade opportunities, and events of interest. For example, when you fill out a request for a quote, we will need you to provide us with contact details.
Provide you with technical assistance and support.
Issue invoices and contact you in connection with payments for our services
4. How can you control your information?
JFrog may retain your information for a period consistent with the original purpose of collection. For example, we will retain your information for as long as you are using our services, and for a reasonable period thereafter. Aggregated and/or anonymous data, and any other Non-personal Information may remain on our servers indefinitely all as permitted under the applicable privacy laws.
You may request to review, correct, delete or otherwise modify any of the PII that was provided to us, or request to confirm whether we process your personal information. In addition, you may object to our processing of your PII for a legitimate interest. Kindly send an email to PII@jfrog.com in connection with the aforementioned issues and we will provide you with all required information.
Please note that you may manage the receipt of marketing and non-transactional information from us by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link located on the bottom of marketing emails sent by us.
5. Sharing information with third parties
Our Websites and some of the Services allow you to share information with other users and create and publish content.
