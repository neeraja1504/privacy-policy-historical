Your Email Lists and Databases
JangoSMTP and its parent company JangoMail, Inc. will never sell, rent, share, or otherwise make available your email lists and/or databases to anyone except internal support personnel who may be assisting you in troubleshooting your account, unless it is required to do so in connection with legal process or in accordance with any law, regulation or order of a court or regulatory agency of competent jurisdiction.

These technologies are deployed as part of sophisticated security architecture. All data resides in a tightly controlled, secure data center. These investments mean that information about the identity and preferences of individual members is never accessible to anyone outside JangoSMTP. We will maintain safeguards to protect the security of these servers and your personally identifiable information.
