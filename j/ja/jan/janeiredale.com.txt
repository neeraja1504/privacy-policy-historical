Last updated August 2, 2017
We at Iredale Mineral Cosmetics, Ltd. (“IMC”) are committed to protecting the privacy of our customers and visitors. This Privacy Notice describes the ways in which we collect, use, disclose and protect information about you in connection with your use of our website. When you use our website, you consent to our collection, use, and disclosure of information about you as described in this Privacy Notice.
1. Personal Information
“Personal information” is information by which you can be identified, such as your name, e-mail address, billing and mailing addresses, telephone number(s) and credit card number(s). When you provide personal information on our website, you are consenting to the way in which we collect, use and disclose your personal information, as described in this Privacy Notice.
We may collect personal information that you provide when you:
Register with our website;
Make a purchase from our website;
Submit an entry in a contest or sweepstakes sponsored by us, respond to one of our surveys or participate in another feature of our website; or
Provide us with user content, ideas, information, user reviews, comments, feedback or other submissions.
We do not sell (or trade or rent) your personal information to third parties for their own marketing use. It’s possible, however, that we might acquire or merge with or be acquired by another company or that we might sell certain of our assets. In that event, we may disclose your personal information to another company, but that disclosure will be subject to the privacy notice that we then have in effect.
As do most Internet retailers, we engage third parties to perform functions on our behalf consistent with this Privacy Notice. We may provide your personal information to those third parties in order to allow them to perform their functions for us. Such information will be transmitted only through reasonably secure channels. We may also receive information from third party partners, such as marketing and demographic data, offline records and information from an advertiser about your experiences or interactions with them, which information we may combine with other information we receive from or about you.
2. Registration at Our Website
You have the option to register at our website, but no registration is required to browse our website. In order to register, you may be required to select a password and provide your name, e-mail address, and other information. You may edit any of your personal information at any time by logging into your account and following the "edit this information" link. If you do not create an account during a purchase, you may choose to create one later with the same email address you used for the purchase.
3. Purchases
When you make a purchase from janeiredale.com, we will collect the personal information needed to process and ship your order, including your name, phone number, e-mail address, shipping and billing addresses, and credit card number. We will use that information to process your order and to provide you with customer service.
We employ reasonable security measures to protect your personal and financial information. Credit card details supplied at checkout are transmitted directly to our payment provider over a secure connection (SSL). We do not save your full credit card number or security code on our servers. We keep only your card’s expiration date and the last four digits of your card number. This helps you and us to identify your saved credit card(s) when you call us or visit us online.
4. Participation in Contests, Sweepstakes, and Similar Promotions
Any sweepstake, contest or similar promotion made available through our website (or other of our platforms, such as social media) may be governed by rules specific to that contest, sweepstake or other promotion.

The data these companies collect may be combined with data from other websites, mobile applications and sources. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and web beacons is not linked to any personal information about you collected by us.
