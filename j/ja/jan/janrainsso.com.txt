Information We Collect Automatically and Cookies
We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our website.  For example, like many websites, our Janrain.com website uses “cookies”: We set a cookie for every user who visits our Janrain.com website. This initiates an anonymous browsing record until a visitor fills out a form (at janrain.com or developers.janrain.com) at which point we match the visitor’s anonymous record to an identifiable visitor using the information the visitor provided by filling out the form.  We also gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.

Cookies allow us to store and retrieve login information on a user’s system. They provide us with data that we can use to improve the quality of our website and make it easier to use.
We use information gathered automatically and stored in log files to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.  For example, we may use the non-personally identifiable information, like your IP address, to statistically analyze site usage and to customize our site’s content, layout and services. The resulting information will allow us to improve our services and better understand and serve our website users.
5.  Sharing of Personal Information Collected
We share information that identifies you only as described below and with subsidiaries we control that follow the same practices described in this Privacy Statement.
Third Party Service Providers : We may retain other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf, such as sending email, removing repetitive and inaccurate information from customer lists, analyzing data, processing credit cards, and providing marketing assistance.   They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.
Protecting Others and Ourselves : We will disclose your personally identifiable information if we believe disclosure is necessary to comply with the law or to protect our rights, property, or safety, our customer, or others.

8.  Customer Data
- Observance of Safe Harbor Principles
As mentioned at the beginning of this Privacy Statement, we offer our customers a software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) customer profile management platform and abide by the U.S. – EU and U.S. – Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks for protecting the privacy of data flowing from the EU and Switzerland to the United States.  As a processor of personal information on behalf of our customers, we observe the Safe Harbor Principles, several of which are discussed below.
Notice and Choice:  Individuals may submit personal information to our customers through the use of the website registration and login services we provide to our customers. (Some of these services may have a notice that they are “powered by Janrain”). This personal information is submitted with notice to, and the consent of, the individual user via identity providers’ permission screens, or voluntarily provided by the user at registration. Once Janrain has successfully facilitated the transmission of personal information to a customer’s database that is not hosted by Janrain, it is that customer’s responsibility to guard any the personal information against unauthorized access or transmission.
Our Role Processing and Protecting Customer Data: As part of our Janrain Customer Identity Management Platform™, we may receive and host on our customers’ behalf such personal information and other data a customer may provide to us for hosting (collectively, “Customer Data”). Our customers are the data controllers of Customer Data. As the processors of personal information on behalf of our customers, we follow their instructions with respect to the information they control. In doing so, we implement appropriate technical, physical and administrative measures against unauthorized processing of such information and against loss, destruction of, or damage to, personal information. We do not determine how our customers use Customer Data, and we will not access or disclose it except as directed by our customers or required by law.
Accessing, Correcting, Amending, or Deleting Personal Information: If you are an individual seeking access to, or who would like to correct, amend, or delete your personal information which Janrain may be storing on behalf of our customer, you should direct your request to the applicable Janrain customer acting as the data controller for such information. Customers may access and delete Customer Data, including an individual record, via an application provider interface or API. Following the deletion of personal information in a database we host, the related backup data will be deleted, generally within 30 days.
