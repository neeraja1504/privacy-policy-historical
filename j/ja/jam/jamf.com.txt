Privacy Policy | Jamf
Your privacy is important to JAMF Software, LLC. As a result, we’ve developed this Privacy Policy that covers how we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store your information. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with our privacy practices and let us know if you have any questions.
A. Overview
JAMF Software, LLC and its Affiliates (identified in Section F below) (herein collectively “Jamf”) makes reasonable efforts to protect the privacy of your personal information. This Privacy Policy was created to demonstrate our commitment to fair information practices. This Privacy Policy covers Jamf’s use of personal information that we collect in the normal course of our business, when you use our corporate websites or applications, and when you otherwise interact with us, including when you attend events hosted or attended by Jamf and when you contact us for customer support (collectively, the “Services”).
In addition to covering how we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store your information, this policy also discloses our purpose and lawful basis for processing your information, and your related rights.Our legal basis for collecting and using personal information will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. In most cases, the lawful basis will be that the processing: (i) is necessary for our legitimate interests in carrying out our business with you, including direct marketing, provided those interests are not outweighed by your rights and interests, or (ii) is necessary to perform a contract with you. Where processing is based on your consent, we will identify the processing purposes and provide you with relevant information to make the processing fair and transparent. If you have consented to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place.
Our Services are not directed to anyone under the age of 16, and Jamf does not knowingly solicit or collect information from anyone under 16 years of age.If you are a parent or guardian and believe we may have collected information about a child, please contact us at privacy@jamf.com.
Jamf may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. In the event we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by email or by posting the revised policy on our corporate website (www.jamf.com/privacy-policy). When we update this Privacy Policy, we will note the date the most recent revision was posted below, at the end of the policy. Any revisions will become effective upon (7) calendar days following such posting on our corporate website.

For legitimate human resources purposes, employees may choose to voluntarily disclose personal information about family members. If our employees choose to do this, their family member’s personal information shall be treated, for the purposes of this Privacy Policy, the same as an employee’s personal information. Unless otherwise noted or excluded by context, “employee information” is included within the definition of “personal information” for the purposes of this Policy. Employee information is never sold, leased, or rented to any third party. Employee information will never be disclosed to third parties except as follows:
to those retained by JAMF Software, LLC or its affiliates for processing only for the purposes set forth above;
where required pursuant to an applicable law, governmental or judicial order, law or regulation, or to protect the rights or property of JAMF Software, LLC or its affiliates;
in the event of sale of the business, merger, acquisition, etc.;
where authorized electronically or in writing by the employee; and
where the employee voluntarily provides personal information and the context makes it clear that employee information will be provided to a third party/subprocessor (ex. payroll, benefits, travel, reimbursement, and other systems used in the employment context).
we disclose your personal information to our private equity sponsor, Vista Equity Partners, and its affiliates, including Vista Consulting Group (collectively, “ Vista ”), for administration, research, database development and business operation purposes, in line with the terms of this Privacy Policy. Vista processes your personal information on the basis of its legitimate interests in overseeing the recruitment process and, if applicable, your employment relationship with Jamf. If you have consented to us doing so, we also share your personal information with other Vista portfolio companies for the purpose of being considered for other job opportunities in the pooling system, both inside and outside the EEA. Please find a full list of all Vista portfolio companies at: https://www.vistaequitypartners.com/companies/. Where this requires us to transfer your personal information outside of the EEA, please refer to Section B of the Privacy Policy for further details. In connection with the recruitment process, we transfer your personal information outside of the EEA to Hirebridge, LLC and Criteria Corp., which provide applicant tracking services. Hirebridge, LLC and Criteria Corp. both comply with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and ensure that your personal information is adequately protected whilst outside of the EEA.
Where personal information is transferred from the EU or Switzerland to the US in the context of the employment relationship, we will cooperate in investigations by and comply with the advice of the EU Data Protection Authorities (DPAs) and Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commission (FDPIC).
G. Sharing of Personal Information & Accountability for Onward Transfer
From time to time, Jamf may engage third party business partners, vendors, or subprocessors to perform functions such as sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, data storage, processing credit card payments, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), and providing customer service. Such companies shall only use your information for those purposes required to perform their functions. Additionally, Jamf may share your information, without your prior consent, in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, or transfer of assets. When information is shared, Jamf will ascertain that any third parties are obligated to provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required under this policy. Should Jamf transfer information outside of a local jurisdiction, it shall only be done with adequate protections in place and in compliance with applicable laws and standards.
Jamf may share your information if we have a good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (i) protect and defend the rights or property of Jamf; (ii) enforce this Privacy Policy or the Services’ terms and conditions of access and use agreement; (iii) participate in dispute resolution pursuant to this Privacy Policy; (iv) protect the interests of other users of the Services or any other person; or (v) operate or conduct maintenance and repair of the Services or equipment.
Jamf may be required to disclose an individual’s information in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
Jamf shall remain liable under the Principle of Accountability for Onward Transfer if its subprocessors process your information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, unless Jamf proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
H. Protection of Information
Taking into account the risks involved in the processing and nature of information and to prevent loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction and while maintaining data accuracy, Jamf has put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial policies and procedures to safeguard the information Jamf collects. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology. However, the safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where you have chosen or we have given you a user name and password for access to certain parts of the Services, you are responsible for keeping the user name and password confidential. Although we do our best to protect the information, we cannot and do not guarantee the security of your information.
I. Retention
Jamf will retain your information for only as long as it serves the purposes for which it was collected and will be retained in a form identifying or making identifiable only for as long as it serves a purpose of processing.
J. Other Limits to Your Privacy
The Services may contain links to other non-Jamf websites. Jamf is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites. Jamf has no control over the use of such websites and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose any information on these websites.
K. Choice
We seek to provide you with choices regarding the information you provide to us. You can always opt not to disclose information. However, if you elect to do so, this may impact functionality or prevent the use of Jamf’s products or services.

Please note that if you opt-out of receiving marketing-related emails from us, we may still send you important operational or administrative messages.
L. Access and Correction
You have the right to access the personal information we hold about you. You may access your information that Jamf holds by contacting us via Section N below. You have the right to correct, amend, or delete that information where it is inaccurate, or has been processed in violation of the Privacy Shield Principles, except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the individual’s privacy in the case in question, or where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated.
To protect your privacy and security, Jamf may also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before making corrections to or deleting your account.
M. Regulatory Oversight
For this Privacy Policy and its content, Jamf is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
