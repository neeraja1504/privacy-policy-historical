JamLegend does not share your personally identifiable information with other organizations for their marketing or promotional uses without your prior express consent.

JamLegend may disclose Automatically Collected and other aggregate non-personally-identifiable information (such as IP addresses, anonymous User usage data, listening preferences, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third parties to assist those parties in understanding the usage and demographic patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, promotions, or other functionality on the JamLegend Platform.
We may disclose some limited User information to affiliated companies or other businesses or persons to: provide web site hosting, maintenance, and security services; fulfill orders; conduct data analysis and create reports; offer certain functionality; and assist JamLegend in improving the JamLegend Platform and creating new services features.

JamLegend may disclose User information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. copyright or trademark law) or respond to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena, or warrant in the manner required by the requesting entity.
JamLegend also reserves the right to disclose User information that we believe, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to take precautions against liability; enforce our Terms of Use; protect JamLegend from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses; to investigate and defend ourselves against third-party claims or allegations; to assist government enforcement agencies; to protect the security or integrity of the JamLegend Platform; or to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of JamLegend, our Users, or others.

5. Advertisers
JamLegend allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the JamLegend Platform. These third-party ad servers or ad networks may use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements that appear within the JamLegend Platform and they automatically receive your IP Address and other automatically collected information when this happens. Such third-party ad servers may also use other technologies (such as cookies, javascript, or web beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize their advertising content.
JamLegend does not provide your personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent. However, please note that if an advertiser asks JamLegend to show an advertisement to a certain audience or audience segment and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience that they were trying to reach.
You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks. This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites. JamLegend reserves the right the add or remove third-party ad networks or ad servers in its discretion and JamLegend may not at all times list such updated ad network or ad server partners in this Privacy Policy.
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.

These cookies enable more customized ads, content or services to be provided to you. To trigger these cookies, we may pass an encrypted or “hashed” (non-human readable) identifier corresponding to your email address to a Web advertising partner, who may place a cookie on your computer. No personally identifiable information is on, or is connected to, these cookies. To opt-out of these cookies, please go to http://www.privacychoice.org/choose.
