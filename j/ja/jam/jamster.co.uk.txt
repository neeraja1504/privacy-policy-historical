We may collect your name, email address, billing information, mobile telephone number and other information reasonably requested from time to time. You voluntarily submit information to Company when you (1) register for the Service (via web, WAP, SMS or otherwise), (2) access or view Jamster content without registering for the Service, (3) participate in activities like sweepstakes, contests, games, surveys and forums in connection with content, or (4) suggest (via emails, chats, bulletin boards, etc.) how we can improve the Service.
b) Third Party Sources . We may collect PII from reputable third parties and sources including, without limitation, public databases.
c) Non-Personally Identifiable Information . When your computer contacts our web servers (for example, when you visit the Site, or view an HTML e-mail), our web servers automatically collect Site usage information. Site usage information is non-identifying information that describes how our visitors use and navigate our Site. It can include the number and frequency of visitors to each web page and the length of their stays, browser type, referrer data that identifies the web page visited prior and subsequent to visiting our Site, and IP addresses (see below for more information on IP addresses). We also may determine the applicable technology available in order to serve you the most appropriate version of a web page, e-mail or similar service. This information is used to analyze and improve the Site.
d) Cookies . We may collect PII using "cookies". Cookies are small bits of information that a website places on your computer’s hard drive. Cookies remember information about your activities on the Site and can make your visits to the Site easier and more enjoyable. For example, Jamster may store your password for easy logon next time you visit the Site, and may save your preferences and subscription options to personalize your home page. Company may use cookies to identify your web browser, determine whether you have installed software necessary to access certain material on our Site, determine the total number of visitors to our Site, and to recognize you when you return to our Site. We may also use information about your activities on the Site to limit the ads you see on our Site to those we think you may be interested in. You can program your computer to warn you when a cookie is being sent or to refuse cookies completely, but without cookies you may not have access to certain Service features. Third party advertisements displayed on as part of the Service may also contain cookies set by the advertisers. Company does not control these cookies. Users should check the advertiser’s privacy policy to determine whether and how it uses cookies.
e) Use of Web Beacons . Our web pages or e-mail messages may contain a small graphic image called a web beacon, which is sometimes also called a "clear gif", that allows us to monitor and collect certain limited information about our Users, such as the type of browser requesting the web beacon, the IP address of the computer that the web beacon is sent to and the time the web beacon was viewed. Web beacons can be very small or invisible to the user, but, in general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page or e-mail, including HTML based content, can act as a web beacon. We may use web beacons to count visitors to Site or to monitor how our users navigate the Site, and we may include web beacons in e-mail messages in order to count how many messages we sent were actually opened or acted upon. We may also use web beacons to compile aggregate statistics about the Service and our marketing campaigns.
f) Site Visitors . We may collect certain information about Site visitors for site maintenance, optimization, security and other legally permissible purposes. Such information may include, without limitation, visitors’ IP addresses, browser types, dates, times, and duration of visits, and particular pages viewed. An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer or network when you are linked to the Internet. When you request pages from our Site, our servers log your IP address. We may use IP address for a number of purposes, such as system administration, to report aggregate information to our business partners or to audit the use of the Site. We may associate your IP address with the PII you provide.
