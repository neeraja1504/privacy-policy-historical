James Perse Enterprises, Inc. (“James Perse” or “we” or “us”) respects your privacy.  This Privacy Policy applies to personal information we collect on JamesPerse.com (the “Site”), in our stores and through other channels, as described below.   The policy explains how we collect and use this information and with whom we share it.  Please know that James Perse will never share, sell or rent your information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.  The policy also explains our efforts to secure your information and ways you may access and change your information and preferences.
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time without prior notice to you.  If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy or by providing more prominent notice, as appropriate.

We automatically collect certain information from you when you access our Site, such as your browser type, operating system, IP address, pages accessed on our Site, links clicked, time spent on the Site and your general location.  Subject to applicable law, we treat this information as non-personal.  We use this information to tailor the content of our website and to enhance your shopping and customer service experience.
Cookies And Other Tracking Technology
We use "cookies," "web beacons" and other tracking technologies, which sometimes distinguish you from other visitors to this website, to understand better how you interact with our Site and email communications. A cookie is a small text file that may be stored on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies enable our Site to recognize your device upon future visits. Web beacons, typically a one-pixel image on a webpage or in an email, are used to communicate information from your computer to a website, such as the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the beacon appears and browsing activity. By using cookies and web beacons, we may: (1) remember you when you return to JamesPerse.com; (2) keep track of your order as you shop our Site; (3) preserve your shopping bag for later consideration; (4) grant access to the secure parts of the Site; and (5) monitor, improve and customize our web content, our products and services and our promotional and advertising activities. You can manage, refuse or block cookies and web beacons at any time through the settings in your web browser. However, by doing so, you may not be able to access or use certain features of our Site.
In addition, we and select service providers may collect personal information about our visitors' online activities over time and across third party websites. Some web browsers and devices permit you to broadcast a preference that you not be "tracked" online. Our website is not designed to respond to "do not track" signals received from browsers or other mechanisms that provide internet users the ability to choose how their information is collected over time and across third party websites or online services.

With vendors, consultants and other service providers who use the information solely to carry out our instructions and for no other purpose;
To comply with a request for information by law enforcement, or to the extent required by applicable law, regulation or legal process;

How We Secure Your Information
Security is extremely important to us. We maintain appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect the personal information you provide on this website and in our stores against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized access, disclosure, destruction, loss, alteration or use.  We use Secure Socket Layering (SSL) technology to ensure that personal and payment information provided on JamesPerse.com is protected when transmitted over the Internet.  Please check the URL line of your browser when submitting information.  When the letters in the URL line change from "http" to "https," the "s" is an indication that you are now in a secure area employing SSL.
Unfortunately, the transmission of data via the Internet is never completely secure.  While we do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of information shared with us online.  If you prefer to order by telephone, you may contact us at 866 466 0668.  One of our customer service representatives will be happy to take your order.
When you store information in an online account, we ask that you protect such information with a password.  Please take care to protect your password.  We will never ask you for your password.
Third Party Sites And Stores
Our website may, from time to time, contain links to other sites operated by companies that are not affiliated with James Perse.  These third party sites may have different privacy policies, which you should review if you access the sites from JamesPerse.com.  We are not responsible for the content or practices of any websites that are not affiliated with James Perse.
This Privacy Policy also does not apply to the department, specialty or other non-James Perse stores in which our products are sold.   Unless information is supplied in a James Perse shop-in-shop on a James Perse Client Contact card (in which case this policy will apply), information collected in a non-James Perse store is subject to those stores’ privacy policies or notices.
