Effective as of August 1, 2017, Zendesk, Inc., (“Zendesk”) and its subsidiaries, (collectively, the “Zendesk Group” or “we” or “us” or “our”) have updated our Privacy Policy (“Policy”). For a prior version of our Privacy Policy, click here.
1. Introduction
This Policy details our commitment to protecting the privacy of individuals who visit our Websites (as herein defined) (“Website Visitors”), who register to use our Services, or who attend or register to attend sponsored events or other events at which the Zendesk Group participates (“Attendees”). For the purposes of this Policy, the term, “Websites”, shall refer collectively to www.zendesk.com as well as the other websites that the Zendesk Group operates and that link to this Policy.
2. Scope Of This Policy
In addition to the Websites that link to this Policy, this Policy applies to the following:
The Zendesk Marketplace, which is an online marketplace for on-demand web applications utilized in conjunction with some of the Services. The Zendesk Group and third parties may post applications to the Zendesk Marketplace. When we post an application and the application links to this Policy, this Policy applies. When a third party posts an application, the privacy policy of the third party applies.
The Zendesk Developer Portal, which enables Subscribers to create web applications and other integrations with our Services. For the purposes of this Policy, “Subscriber”, as the term is used herein, shall refer to an individual or an entity that has agreed to a Service Agreement for use of our Services.
In this Policy, personal information means information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. An identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to his/her physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity. The use of information collected through our Service shall be limited to the purpose of providing the service for which the Subscribers has engaged.
Our Websites may contain links to other websites and the information practices and the content of such other websites are governed by the privacy statements of such other websites. We encourage you to review the privacy statements of any such other websites to understand their information practices.
With the exception of Account Information (as defined below) and other information we collect in connection with your registration or authentication into our Services (as defined below), this Policy does not apply to our security and privacy practices in connection with your access to and use of the products and services which we market for subscription on our Websites (our “Services”). These security and privacy practices, including how we protect, collect, and use electronic data, text, messages, communications or other materials submitted to and stored within the Services by You (“Service Data”), are detailed in and governed by our Master Subscription Agreement, available here, or such other applicable agreement between you and any member of the Zendesk Group relating to your access to and use of such Services (“Service Agreement”).
Subscribers to our Services are solely responsible for establishing policies for and ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, as well as any and all privacy policies, agreements or other obligations, relating to the collection of personal information in connection with the use of our Services by individuals with whom our Subscribers interact. If you are an individual who interacts with a Subscriber using our Services, then you will be directed to contact our Subscriber for assistance with any requests or questions relating to your personal information.
We collect information under the direction of our Subscribers, and have no direct relationship with individuals whose personal information we process in connection with the use of our Services. If you are an individual who interacts with a Subscriber using our Services (such as a customer of one of our Subscribers) and would no longer like to be contacted by one of our Subscribers that use our Services, please contact the Subscriber that you interact with directly.
We may transfer personal information to companies that help us provide our Services. Transfers to subsequent third parties for these purposes are governed by the Service Agreements with our Subscribers.

4. Information That We Collect From You on our Websites
Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies:
We and our authorized partners use cookies and other information gathering technologies for a variety of purposes. These technologies may provide us with personal information, information about devices and networks you utilize to access our Websites, and other information regarding your interactions with our Websites. For detailed information about the use of cookies in the Websites, please read and review our Cookie Policy found here.
We partner with third parties to either display advertising on the Websites or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partners may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on our Websites and other sites in order to suggest advertisements based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking here (or if located in the European Union click here). Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads and you will continue to receive generic ads.
Web beacons, tags and scripts may be used on our Websites or in email or other electronic communications we send to you. These assist us in delivering cookies, counting visits to our Websites, understanding usage and campaign effectiveness and determining whether an email has been opened and acted upon. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by our third-party service providers on an individual and aggregated basis.
We use Local Storage Objects (“LSOs”) such as HTML5 to store content information and preferences. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our Websites or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity use LSOs such as HTML5 and Flash to collect and store information.

This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses as well as browser type, internet service provider, URLs of referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, information you search for, locale and language preferences, identification numbers associated with your devices, your mobile carrier, and system configuration information.

We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information you submit within the mobile application.
5. Information Collected From Other Sources
Social Media Widgets:
The Websites include social media features, such as the Facebook Like button, and widgets, such as the Share This button or interactive mini-programs that run on our Websites. These features may collect your Internet protocol address, which page you are visiting on the Websites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on the Websites. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy statement of the companies that provide them.
Information From Third Party Services:
We may also obtain other information, including personal information, from third parties and combine that with information we collect through our Websites. For example, we may have access to certain information from a third party social media or authentication service if you log into our Services through such a service or otherwise provide us with access to information from the service. Any access that we may have to such information from a third party social media or authentication service is in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by that service. By authorizing us to connect with a third party service, you authorize us to access and store your name, email address(es), current city, profile picture URL, and other personal information that the third party service makes available to us, and to use and disclose it in accordance with this Policy. You should check your privacy settings on these third party services to understand and change the information sent to us through these services. For example, you can log in to the Services using sign-in services such as Facebook Connect or an Open ID provider, as further described below.
Single Sign-On:
You can log into certain Services using sign-in services such as Facebook Connect or an Open ID provider. These services will authenticate your identity, provide you with the option to share certain personal information (such as your name and email address) with us, and pre-populate our sign up form. Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities in the Services to your profile page to share with others within your network.

8. International Transfer Of Information Collected
Zendesk is a U.S.-based, global company. We primarily store personal information about Website Visitors and Subscribers within the European Economic Area (the “EEA”), the United States and in other countries and territories. To facilitate our global operations, we may transfer and access such personal information from around the world, including from other countries in which the Zendesk Group has operations for the purposes described in this Policy. We may also transfer your personal information to our third party subprocessors as detailed here, who may be located in a different country to you.
Whenever Zendesk shares personal information originating in the European Economic Area (EEA) with a Zendesk entity outside the EEA, it will do so on the basis of its approved binding corporate rules known as the Zendesk Binding Corporate Rules (“Zendesk’s BCR”) which establish adequate protection of such personal information and are legally binding on the Zendesk Group.
Zendesk’s BCRs were approved by the European data protection authorities on 19 May 2017 and are available online. To access Zendesk’s BCRs, please follow the relevant links below:
– Zendesk’s Processor Binding Corporate Rules (which apply when Zendesk’s processes personal data on behalf of its customers); and
– Zendesk’s Controller Global Binding Corporate Rules (which apply when Zendesk processes personal data for which it is a data controller).
Where Zendesk’s BCR do not apply, Zendesk will instead rely on other lawful measures to transfer your personal information outside the EEA and Switzerland, such as the EU standard contractual clauses or Privacy Shield Framework detailed in this section.
If you are visiting our Websites from the EEA or other regions with laws governing data collection and use, please note that you are agreeing to the transfer of your personal information to the United States and other jurisdictions in which we operate. By providing your personal information, you consent to any transfer and processing in accordance with this Policy.
Privacy Shield Frameworks:
Zendesk abides by and has certified adherence to the principles of the EU-U.S. and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States. Zendesk has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view Our certification, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/. If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request.
For residual Privacy Shield disputes that cannot be resolved by the methods above, you may be able to invoke a binding arbitration process under certain conditions. To find out more about the Privacy Shield’s binding arbitration scheme, please see: https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-introduction. The Federal Trade Commission has investigation and enforcement authority over our compliance with the Privacy Shield.
If we have received your personal information under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfer it to a third party service provider for processing, we will remain responsible if they process your personal information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
9. Communications Preferences
We offer those who provide personal contact information a means to choose how we use the information provided. You may manage your receipt of marketing and non- transactional communications by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link located on the bottom of our marketing emails or you may send a request to privacy@zendesk.com.
10. Correcting, Updating and Removing Your Information
Upon request we will provide you with information about whether we hold, or process on behalf of a third party, any of your personal information.

To make a request to have personal information maintained by us returned to you or removed, please email support@zendesk.com. Requests to access, change, or remove your information will be handled within 30 days.
An individual who seeks access to, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccuracies in personal information stored or processed by us on behalf of a Subscriber should direct his/her query to the Subscriber (the data controller). Upon receipt of a request from one of our Subscribers for us to remove the data, we will respond to their request within thirty (30) days. We will retain personal information that we store and process on behalf of our Subscribers for as long as needed to provide the Services to our Subscribers. We will retain and use this personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once it is received.
