Jackson Hewitt | Privacy Policy
Effective Date: 11/14/2018
Jackson Hewitt Inc. (“Jackson Hewitt,” “we,” “us” or “our”) recognizes the importance of protecting the information provided to us by visitors to www.jacksonhewitt.com (our “Website”). This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) explains what information may be collected from you when you visit our Website, regardless of how you access or use the Website, whether via personal computers, mobile devices, or otherwise, and how that information is used and how it is shared with third parties. It also describes your choices regarding the use, access, and collection of your personal information.
Jackson Hewitt offers individual tax preparation services and related products and services, including in certain markets, tax debt resolution services, through various affiliates, franchisees and company-owned stores. Because we offer in-store and online tax preparation services, our privacy policies will vary depending on how you interact with Jackson Hewitt. This Privacy Policy applies solely to our Website, independent of any business relationship you may have with us. This Privacy Policy does not apply to our data collection activities offline or otherwise outside of our Website (unless otherwise stated below).
This Privacy Policy may change and will be updated on our Website. Changes are made when necessary to maintain the security, effectiveness, and appropriateness of our privacy and data security policies and practices, and to reflect the on-going changes in our industry. You should check this page periodically to ensure that you are in agreement with any changes. If we amend this Privacy Policy to permit material changes in the way we collect, use, and/or share your personal information, we will notify you of such amendment by prominently posting notice of such amendment on our Website’s homepages prior to the change becoming effective or by email (sent to the email address associated with your account). However, we will not use your previously collected personal information in a manner materially different than indicated at the time it was collected without your consent.
In addition, please review the Website’s Terms of Use, which governs your use of the Website. By using our Website, you consent to our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use, and our collection, use, and sharing of your information and data, and other activities, as described below.
If you have questions or concerns regarding our Privacy Policy or practices, please contact us by calling (800) 234-1040 or emailing us at privacy@jhnet.zendesk.com.
A. Information Collected by Jackson Hewitt
1. Voluntary Registration
We collect personal information (which may include, without limitation, your name, email address, social security number, date of birth, credit card information, mailing address and/or telephone number) from you when you voluntarily register on the Website or when you request information or a service (e.g., tax preparation services) on the Website. Additional information may be gathered during your subsequent use of the site, or when we communicate with you via telephone, email or other means. This personal information may include, without limitation, your employment and income information, your bank account information, credit scores and credit history, and tax return information and associated IRS filings. In order to create an account on our Website and administer that account, we will also collect a username and password which you will then use to access your account and other information.
2. Surveys or Contests
From time-to-time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our Websites. If you participate, we may request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address) and demographic information (such as zip code).
3. Passive Collection
As is true of most websites, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies to gather certain information automatically. This information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, the files viewed on our Website (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data to analyze trends in the aggregate and administer the Website.
4. Tracking Technologies
Jackson Hewitt and our partners use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the Website, track users’ movements around the Website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole (“Tracking Technologies”). These Tracking Technologies may set, change, alter or modify settings or configurations on your device. You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functions on our Website or service.
A few of the Tracking Technologies include, without limitation, the following (and subsequent technology and methods later developed):
Cookies. A cookie is a data file placed on a device when it is used to visit the Website. A Flash cookie (or locally shared object) is a data file placed on a device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your device. HTML5 cookies can be programmed through HTML5 local storage. Unlike Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies do not require a plug-in. Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools that are available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some but not all instances can be blocked in the future by selecting certain settings. Each browser you use will need to be set separately and different browsers offer different functionality and options in this regard. Also, these tools may not be effective with regard to Flash cookies or HTML5 cookies. For information on disabling Flash cookies, go to Adobe’s website at http://www.adobe.com. Please be aware that if you disable or remove cookies, Flash cookies, or HTML5 cookies on your device, some parts of our Website may not function properly, and that when you revisit our Website your ability to limit cookies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.
Web Beacons. Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1x1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”) may be included in our Website’s pages and messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a page or email can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Website, to monitor how users navigate the Website, to count how many emails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.
Embedded Scripts. An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Website, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Website, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.
Browser Fingerprinting. Browse Fingerprinting is the collection and analysis of information from your device, such as, including without limitation, your operating system, plug-ins, system fonts and other data, for purposes of identification. ETag, or entity tag, is a feature of the cache in browsers. It is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL. If the resource content at that URL ever changes, a new and different ETag is assigned. Used in this manner ETags is a form of device Identifier. ETag tracking may generate unique tracking values even where the consumer blocks HTTP, Flash and/or HTML5 cookies.
Recognition Technologies. Recognition Technologies include the application of statistical probability to data sets collected about devices or users. When utilized, Recognition Technologies can attempt to recognize or make assumptions about users and devices based on the data sets available. For example, a Recognition Technology might analyze available data about multiple devices and make the assumptions that the user of multiple devices is the same user.
Dynamic Number Insertion. Dynamic Number Insertion (“DNI”) is a technology used in call tracking to assign attribution to inbound phone calls. Executed via embedded scripts, DNI allows a specific phone number to be dynamically displayed on a web page. This technology also allows tracking platforms to capture the phone number the caller is calling from without any other identifier of a person.
There may be other Tracking Technologies now and later devised and used by us in connection with the Website. Further, third parties may use Tracking Technologies in connection with our Website, which may include the collection of information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services. We may not control those Tracking Technologies and we are not responsible for them. However, you consent to potentially encountering third-party Tracking Technologies in connection with use of our Website and accept that our statements under this Privacy Policy do not apply to the Tracking Technologies or practices of such third parties.
5. California Do-Not-Track Disclosures
Various third parties are developing or have developed signals or other mechanisms for the expression of consumer choice regarding the collection of information about an individual consumer’s online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services (e.g., browser do-not-track signals). Currently, we do not monitor or take any action with respect to these signals or other mechanisms.
6. Behavioral Targeting / Re-targeting
We partner with a third party to display advertising on our Website and manage our advertising on other websites. Our third-party partner may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on this Website and other websites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by visiting http://preferences.truste.com. Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads. You will continue to receive generic ads.
7. Live Chat
We use live chat to assist you with answers to your questions concerning certain products and offerings. We collect email address and your name to create a customer contact record to assist our Support Center in handling questions. Our chat operations hours are published within the chat feature.
8. Information from Third Parties
We may receive information about you from other individuals that use the Website. Additionally, we may, from time to time, supplement the information we collect directly from you on our Website with outside records from third parties for various purposes, including to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities that may be of interest to you. To the extent we combine information we receive from those sources with your personal information we collect on the Website, it will be treated as personal information and we will apply this Privacy Policy to such combined information, unless we have disclosed otherwise. In no other circumstances do our statements under this Privacy Policy apply to information we receive about you from third parties.
Examples of the types of personal information that may be obtained from public sources or purchased from third parties and combined with information we already have about you, may include:
* Address information about you from third party sources, such as the U.S. Postal Service, for verification and fraud-prevention purposes.
* Purchased marketing data about our customers from third parties that is combined with information we already have about you, to create more tailored advertising and products.
You may opt-out of these practices by emailing us at privacy@jhnet.zendesk.com. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe.
9. Collection and Use of Third Party Personal Information
We may also collect, from you, the following personal information about your contacts: name and email address. When you provide us with personal information about your contacts we will only use this information for the specific reason for which it is provided.
If you believe that one of your contacts has provided us with your personal information and you would like to request that it be removed from our database, please contact us by calling (800) 234-1040 or emailing us at privacy@jhnet.zendesk.com. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe.

Jackson Hewitt may keep track of what portions of the Website visitors are viewing and other visitor statistics such as geographic location, and aggregate this information to help us create a better experience for future Website visits. This is all done without knowing your name or other personal information in order to describe our viewers and services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes. If you do not wish to provide geographic location information, please contact us at privacy@jhnet.zendesk.com. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe.
Our use or disclosure of your information whether collected by us, uploaded by you, or otherwise provided to us, may be limited by Section 7216 of the Internal Revenue Code, the Gramm Leach Bliley Act of 1999, and certain other laws, as well as our policies.
Section 7216 of the Internal Revenue Code requires that we obtain your consent (“opt in”) to the disclosure and use of information you provide us in connection with your tax return information. We will not disclose or use your tax return information for any purpose other than preparing, assisting in preparing, or obtaining or providing services in connection with the preparation of your tax return unless you authorize us to do so, except when expressly required or authorized by law, necessary to the preparation of the tax return, or pursuant to court order. For information, please see the Consent to Disclosure of Tax Return Information form and the Consent to Use of Tax Return Information Consent form that you were provided at the time of receiving tax preparation services.
We may collect personally identifiable information in connection with the resolution of your tax debt through Jackson Hewitt’s Tax Debt Resolution Service (“tax debt resolution information”).

We may use or disclose your personally identifiable information as described below or where you have provided consent under Section 7216, or as otherwise permitted by applicable laws.
At the time of tax preparation or tax debt resolution, we will further explain how we handle your tax return information or tax debt resolution information. Depending on the service you use, we may use or disclose personally identifiable information about you to the following types of third parties: Financial service providers; non- affiliated third-parties providing credit, insurance, financial planning, debt management, and other financial products,; and others. You can find copies of our privacy notices at the following links: Jackson Hewitt Tax Client Privacy Notice and Jackson Hewitt Tax Debt Resolution Privacy Notice.
If you apply for a product or service, we will ask you to authorize us to disclose your tax return information to the financial institution providing such product or service. We will provide you with Consent to Disclosure of Tax Return Information within the tax interview. You should review the agreements and the privacy policies of the financial institution to understand how it may use and disclose your personal information.
In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

We also may disclose such information where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our terms of use, or for other purposes permitted or required by law. In addition, we may transfer information about you if we are acquired by or merged with another company. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Website of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.
C. How Collected Information May Be Shared with Third Parties
Jackson Hewitt may disclose the personal information you provide to us to our service providers, business partners, sponsors or affiliates so they can assist us in providing the services you request. By requesting information from our business partners, sponsors, and affiliates through the Websites, you give us permission to transfer your personal information to them so they can fulfill your request. We may also share aggregated user statistics with third parties.
We may also disclose collected information in certain cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference (either intentionally or unintentionally) with any of our rights or property, visitors, or anyone else. We may disclose or access account information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it and for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain, service, and improve our products and services.
The IRS requires a device ID as part of the electronic filing record to aid in their defense against fraudulent return filing. Device ID identifies the device (e.g., computer, tablet, phone or other device) used to create the tax return. Our software system is recording this ID during the preparation of your tax return and will provide it to the IRS (and states) when your tax return is filed electronically.
