Personally identifiable information
We may collect personally identifiable information from Users in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, when Users visit our Site, register for an Account, place an order, subscribe to a newsletter, or otherwise choose to provide personally identifiable information.

Users may, however, visit our Site anonymously. We will collect personally identifiable information from Users only if they voluntarily submit such information to Us. Users can always refuse to supply personally identification information, except that this may prevent them from engaging in certain Site related activities, creating or accessing an Account, or doing business with us if they do not provide the information that We need.

Confidentiality and security
We adopt appropriate data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures to protect against unauthorised access, alteration, disclosure or destruction of Your personal information, username, password, transaction information and data stored on our Site.

When our Account registration process requests Sensitive Information (such as bank account information and/or credit card information), and when we transmit such Sensitive Information, that Sensitive Information is encrypted and protected with SSL encryption software. While we use SSL encryption to protect Sensitive Information online, we protect all other user information online and offline. The Third Party Agent servers that we utilise to store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure physical environment. The Third Party Agent has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of personally identifiable information stored on its servers.
Please be advised that, although we take every reasonable precaution available to protect your data, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot warrant that your information will be absolutely secure. Any transmission of data on or through our Site is at your own risk. However, access to your personally identifiable information is strictly limited, and not accessible to the public. Only employees, and Third Party Agents, that need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees are dedicated to ensuring the security and privacy of all User information. Employees not adhering to our written firm policies are subject to disciplinary action. In compliance with applicable laws, We shall notify You and any applicable regulatory agencies in the event that We learn of an information security breach with respect to your personally identifiable information. Where possible, You will be notified via e-mail in the event of such a breach. Please be advised that notice may be delayed in order to address the needs of law enforcement, determine the scope of network damage, and to engage in remedial measures.
You acknowledge that you provide your personally identifiable information to us with knowledgeable consent and at your own risk.
