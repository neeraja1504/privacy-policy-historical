Privacy Policy
Your privacy is important to us. We want you to be comfortable viewing our web site
and providing information to us.
What we do
Jackson Associates is in the business of data collection for the purpose of tailoring marketing and advertising to better serve consumer needs. We maintain a database of respondent information in order to more efficiently locate and screen potential participants for marketing research studies. While we screen, recruit and host the marketing research studies, it is our clients who determine the nature of the study, as well as the criteria required for participation.
Information gathering and security
Registration for our database is voluntary. Complete only the information that you are comfortable sharing. You may register two ways:
Sign up online using a form that is electronically transmitted via email to a private email address or database, or
Call 770-394-1701, ext. 705 and leave your complete name and address. A data processing representative will mail you our standard form.
Note: Basic demographic information (sex, age, race, income, education) remains key to the marketing research process, and contact lists are generated from our database based on a study's screening criteria.When a particular piece of information is missing from a respondent record that file is simply excluded from a particular list.
You may be contacted periodically to update your respondent information, either by phone, mail or email. Your information is handled with the utmost respect to privacy. Records are managed by a limited number of specialized personnel. Paper records remain in a secure filing system during and after the processing phase.We never sell or exchange respondent information.
Printed database call lists contain abbreviated information specific to the query.Call lists reside in our call center until a study's conclusion, then they are returned to Data Processing for editing (this is the process we use to update information provided to us over the telephone during screening.)Once editing is complete, lists are shredded onsite.
Only authorized personnel are permitted to access customer information. In addition, all Jackson Associates employees are required to sign non-disclosure agreements regarding the protection of information provided by clients and survey respondents.
Children
Jackson Associates occasionally recruits children for marketing research studies. We comply with federal and state laws regarding child safety and privacy protection.
