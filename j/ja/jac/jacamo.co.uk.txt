+
We will use your data such as your email address and other online identifiers to send you online targeted marketing information about our product offers and promotions via social media platforms.  To do this, we will share your email address in a secure manner with social media organisations, such as Facebook, who will match our advertising requirements to your social media profile.  We have a legitimate business interest to send you product information via social media which we believe is of relevance to you; this is known as Interest-Based Advertising. However, should you wish to exercise your right to stop targeted social media marketing, you can do this at any time - see Changing Your Marketing Preferences.
Third Party Marketing+

Using Your Personal Data to Improve Your Shopping Experience
We want to make sure that we only contact you with content that you will find relevant and interesting.  For this to work effectively, we collect information about your online browsing activity using Cookies when you are using our websites and apps. These Cookies pass back to us your browsing information using your Internet Protocol ("IP") address as the identifier, which we combine with other anonymised, non-personalised and aggregated data, allowing us to determine what content and product information is most relevant to you when you are shopping online.
We may sometimes share some of your personal data with third parties in order to analyse the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns across various marketing channels, including television. This will allow our third party partners to provide us with aggregated, anonymised analysis and they will not use the data we share with them to market their products or services to you.
We have a legitimate business interest to use the aggregated and anonymised data obtained via Cookies and other data sources to help us provide you with relevant product marketing and improve your shopping experience.
Profiling+
Profiling is a term used to describe a form of data processing where significant volumes of data made up of lots of different data types - such as browser history from Cookies, age, gender, size, transaction history, demographics, financial behaviour, preferences and buying habits - are all used in an aggregated, anonymised and non-personalised form to evaluate and predict, based on statistical analysis, what you may or may not want to purchase from us by assigning you to a profile type.  We use this technique to understand what drives you and others like you to buy from us and the types of products you and others are most likely to be interested in whether that be by email, telemarketing, direct mail or social media.  This is sometimes referred to as Big Data and Data Science and is widely used by retailers to improve their customer offering and Interest-Based Advertising.
Interest Based Advertising+
The data that we collect and use when you browse or shop online, including where we use Cookies, uses your IP address as the unique identifier; however, it will not contain your name, home address or phone number. Along with your IP address, we may also capture data about your device to allow us to track performance across different platforms. We may also use your email address to send you online targeted marketing information, but we always use hashed email addresses to keep your data secure. The email addresses are scrambled before being utilised to ensure nobody else can gain access to your email address. This enables us to offer our customers the best possible online user experience and equally allows us to improve the relevancy of our advertising. This allows us to provide you with more of the content you want to see and allows us to evaluate the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.
Using Your Personal Data to Open Your Personal Credit Account
When you apply for a credit account with us, we will use your personal data to make a decision as to whether or not we will accept your application and, if so, the amount of credit we will offer you.  Without this data, we are unable to perform the services under this contract i.e. to calculate the amount of credit offered and manage your credit account in accordance with the applicable guidelines and regulation. This option is not available for new High & Mighty customers.
You have a choice to opt out of providing us with your personal data for the purpose of making an automated decision at the point of application and select a cash account.  By opting out, we will not be able to provide you with a credit account.  However, you can still shop with us by opting for a cash account as an alternative and pay with credit or debit card for your purchases.
We will hold your personal data for 6 years, plus the current financial year, after the date of your last transaction on your personal credit account.
Automated Decisioning and Profiling+
To make a decision with regards to your credit application, we use automated decision making. To do this we will make searches about you with Credit Reference Agencies. We use the data from Credit Reference Agencies, together with personal data you provided to us, transactional data (such as any previous trading or account history with us), public records (such as insolvency register) and other data which you have given permission to be used for this purpose to verify your identity and determine the level of credit we can offer you. This data is used to calculate a score which allows us to categorise customers according to risk.  We do this so that we can respond to your credit application promptly and to ensure our credit lending decisions are fair and responsible.  By proceeding with your application, you agree to the use of these automated processes and acknowledge that without it we are unable to proceed with your credit application.  However, you can still shop with us by opting for a cash account as an alternative and pay with credit or debit card for your purchases.
We have also partnered with Aire Labs Ltd (Aire), authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority for the provision of credit references (FRN:744817), who we may refer you to in order to ask some additional questions. When transferred to Aire you will need to answer all of the questions to complete your credit application with us.
Aire will ask questions about you and your household, such as your financial circumstances, employment, education, and lifestyle. They may also seek further information about you from other data providers and public sources. All of the information collected will be analysed and used to build a picture of your financial standing, which will only be shared with us.
Both us and Aire will share with each other and use the information provided by you in order for us to continue to process your credit application and to support our lending decision making process. We rely on our legitimate interest in ensuring our credit lending decisions are fair and responsible when processing and sharing your data in this way. We will continue to exchange information about you with Aire while you have a relationship with us, so Aire can perform statistical analysis about credit lending decisions and to improve their service. This data will not be shared with anyone else.
Where we are still unable to make an immediate decision, we will refer your application to our Credit Underwriting Team who may request additional information from you.  Should you not wish to provide such information, we will not be able to make a decision with regards to your credit account application for you.  However, you can still shop with us by opting for a cash account as an alternative and pay with credit or debit card for your purchases.
Credit Reference Agencies+
We will request information about you from Credit Reference Agencies ("CRAs") and we will also supply your personal data to CRAs.  The CRAs that we use are Experian, Call Credit, Equifax and Aire Labs Ltd.  For more information as to how CRAs use your personal data, please refer to the Credit Reference Agency Information Notice ("CRAIN") at:
www.experian.co.uk/crain
www.callcredit.co.uk/crain

You can also find information about how Aire handle your data at:
www.aire.io/privacy-app/
These companies receive and share personal and financial data on you from all the companies that you are connected with financially as well as providing us with verification of your name, address, date of birth and gender details from the Electoral Register to prevent fraudulent applications.  The CRA record details of all credit searches and tell us the risk associated with providing credit and if there is any suspected fraudulent activity associated with you.
We will also share your personal data with CRAs and other companies for fraud prevention.  We will continue to exchange information about you with CRAs while you have a relationship with us. We will also inform the CRAs about your settled accounts. If you borrow and do not repay in full and on time, CRAs will record the outstanding debt. This information may be supplied to other organisations by CRAs.  When CRAs receive a search from us they will place a search footprint on your credit file that may be seen by other lenders.
We may make periodic searches of our records that we hold about you, CRAs and fraud prevention agencies to manage your account with us and to take decisions about credit, including whether to make credit available or to extend existing credit arrangements. These searches will not be available to other lenders for credit assessment purposes.
We, CRAs and fraud prevention agencies may also use the credit records for statistical analysis about credit, insurance and fraud generally.  This is not personal data but is aggregated for the purpose of trend analysis, managing debt and fraud prevention.
You have the right to access your personal records held by CRAs by contacting Experian, Call Credit and Equifax directly.
Using Your Personal Data to Open Your Personal Cash Account
When you register to open a personal cash account, we will hold your personal data which you have provided to us.  When you make a subsequent card or cheque payment to purchase products from us, we will use your personal data and card information to process the order. This involves sending your personal data to our card payment and banking providers to ensure that you have sufficient funds to cover the value of the transaction.  Without this data, we are unable to fulfil your order.
We will hold your personal data for 6 years, plus the current financial year, after the date of your last transaction on your personal cash account.
Processing Card Payments+
We process all card payments in line with our obligations under the PCI-DSS regulations.  Whenever you provide your card details to us either online or over the phone, we will encrypt the payment details before sending to our card payment and banking provider.  If you pay over the phone, we will mask any card data that you provide so that this is not visible to our customer advisors as well as stopping card data from being recorded in our Call Recordings.  This is regularly monitored for quality assurance as part of our PCI-DSS obligations.
Any card details provided by customers via paper order forms will be immediately, and securely, destroyed once processed.
Using Your Personal Data for Fraud Prevention
We carry out fraud checks before providing goods or credit to you. In order to do this, we use data sourced from Credit Reference Agencies and other external agencies that are involved in fraud detection to prevent fraud and money laundering, and to verify your identity. Data we use to do this may include: name, address, date of birth, contact details, financial information, employment details and device identifiers, including IP address.
The personal information we have collected from you will be shared with fraud prevention agencies and law enforcement agencies who will use it to prevent fraud and money-laundering and to verify your identity. If fraud is detected, you could be refused certain services, finance, or employment. Further details of how your information will be used by us and these fraud prevention agencies, and your data protection rights, can be found by https://www.cifas.org.uk/fpn
We process your personal data on the basis that we have a legitimate interest in preventing fraud and money laundering, and to verify identity, in order to protect our business and comply with laws that apply to us. Such processing is also a contractual requirement of the services or financing you have requested.
We process your personal data on the basis that we have a legitimate interest in preventing fraud and money laundering, and to verify identity, in order to protect our business and comply with laws that apply to us. Such processing is also a contractual requirement of the services or financing you have requested.
As part of the processing of your data, decisions may be made by automated means. This means we may automatically decide that you pose a fraud or money laundering risk if our processing reveals your behaviour to be consistent with money laundering or known fraudulent conduct, or is inconsistent with your previous submissions, or you appear to have deliberately hidden your true identity.
If we, or a fraud prevention agency, determine that you pose a fraud or money laundering risk, we may refuse to provide the services or financing you have requested, or we may stop providing existing services to you. A record of any fraud or money laundering risk will be retained by the fraud prevention agencies, and may result in others refusing to provide services, financing or employment to you. If you have any questions about this, please contact us on the details above.
Whenever fraud prevention agencies transfer your personal data outside of the European Economic Area, they impose contractual obligations on the recipients of that data to protect your personal data to the standard required in the European Economic Area. They may also require the recipient to subscribe to ‘international frameworks’ intended to enable secure data sharing.
