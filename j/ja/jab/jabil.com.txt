While this Policy is intended to describe the broadest range of our personal information processing activities globally, these processing activities may be more limited in some jurisdictions based on local applicable laws.
Note: If you are a Jabil employee, please see the “Global Privacy Policy for Employees” available on JabilWeb, as this Policy does not apply to your personal information other than as a visitor to this site.

III. HOW WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION
Jabil is a global provider of product design, manufacturing and other related services. Our business entities and departments may share information with each other for business purposes, such as internal administrative activities, marketing and sales, research and development, talent management, and providing you and your organization with Services. We are not in the business of selling, renting, or otherwise sharing information that reasonably identifies you with unaffiliated third parties for their independent use.
In addition to sharing information amongst our affiliates and as otherwise described in this Policy, we may disclose and/or share your information under the following circumstances:
Authorized Service Providers. We may provide access to or share your information with select authorized third party service providers who perform supporting activities or functions on our behalf, such as research, marketing, customer support, personnel recruiting and evaluation, web hosting, data storage, analysis and processing, and legal services.

Business Transfers. As we continue to develop our business, we may buy, merge or partner with other companies. In such transactions, (including in contemplation of such transactions, e.g., due diligence) user information may be among the transferred assets. If a portion or all of Jabil’s assets are sold or transferred to a third-party, customer information (including your email address) would likely be one of the transferred business assets.

Contractual Obligation  - Where use of your information is necessary to perform our obligations under a contract with you;
Legitimate Interest  – Where use of your information is necessary to further our legitimate business interests, such as the following ways:
- To provide customer service;
- Improve our products and service offerings;
- Attract workforce talent and process job applications;
- Grow our business through marketing and other strategic initiatives;
- Protect our customers, personnel, and property; and

V. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS OF INFORMATION
When you use the Services, your data may be sent to the United States and possibly other countries. Specifically, as part of our international operations, your personal information may be transferred to any country where we have facilities or in which we engage service providers. By using the Services, you consent and understand that your information may be transferred to countries outside of your country of residence, which may have data protection rules that are different from those of your country.
Specific to data transfers outside the European Union (“EU”), some non-European Economic Area (“EEA”) countries are recognized by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of data protection according to EEA standards (the full list of these countries is available here). For transfers from the EEA to countries not considered adequate by the European Commission, we will take reasonable steps, such as implementing the Standard Contractual Clauses adopted by the European Commission, to protect your personal information.
In addition, to further legitimize our commitment to securing data transfers from the EEA to the United States, Jabil will be seeking certification pursuant to the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework. This Policy will be updated to reflect our promises and obligations under these frameworks once certification is complete.
VI. DATA SUBJECT RIGHTS AND YOUR CHOICES
You may always choose what personal information (if any) you wish to provide to us. However, if you choose not to provide certain details, some of your experiences and access to Services may be affected. Again, details on how to limit the collection of your information and exercise your opt-out options are provided in Section 1 “Information We Collect” (above) and further detailed in the Cookie Policy.
If you provide us with your contact details, we may contact you to let you know about the products, services, and events offered that we think may be of interest to you. If you no longer want to receive such marketing-related communications from us on a going-forward basis, you may opt-out by following the unsubscribe instructions in any such messages or by contacting us by email at privacy@jabil.com. We will respond to and comply with your request(s) as soon as reasonably practicable.
To the extent you use Service features that require log-in and thus create an account, you may review and update certain of your personal data by logging into your account. If you need additional assistance, you may contact us by email at privacy@jabil.com. In situations in which we have your information as part of a customer relationship or business transaction, we may refer the request to the relevant customer and cooperate with their handling of the request, subject to any special contractual arrangement with that customer.
In addition, individuals in the EU and some other jurisdictions outside the United States have certain legal rights with regard to accessing personal information that you have provided to us. If you would like to request to review, correct, update, restrict, object, or delete personal information that you have previously provided to us, or if you would like to request to receive an electronic copy of your personal information for purposes of transmitting it to another company (to the extent this right to data portability is provided to you by applicable law), you may contact us by email at privacy@jabil.com. The rights described here are subject to limitations and exceptions under applicable law. We will respond to and comply with your request(s) consistent with applicable law as soon as reasonably practicable.
In addition to the rights above, residents of the EEA also have the right to lodge a complaint with your relevant supervisory authority. However, we encourage you to contact us first, and we will do our very best to resolve your concern in accordance with applicable law.
VII. SECURITY
We have implemented industry accepted administrative, technical, and physical security measures to protect against the loss, misuse and/or alteration of your information. However, we cannot and do not guarantee that these measures will provide absolute security. No Internet, wireless and/or other electronic transmissions can be completely secure. Moreover, we are not responsible for the security of information you transmit to us over networks that we do not control.
If you have created a Services related account, we recommend that you change your passwords periodically. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your applicable account usernames and passwords. If you believe that your account username and/or password have been stolen or been made known to others, you must contact us immediately at privacy@jabil.com and change your password immediately. We are not responsible if someone else accesses your account(s) through information that they have obtained from you.
VIII. DATA RETENTION
We keep your information for no longer than necessary for the purposes for which it is processed. The length of time for which we retain information depends on the purposes for which we collected and use it and/or as required to comply with applicable laws.
IX. LINKS TO OTHER SITES AND SERVICES
The Services may contain links to or “frame” third-party websites, applications and other services. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites and services. We encourage users to be aware when they leave our Services and to read the privacy statements of each and every site they visit that collects their information.
X. INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN
The Services are not directed to children under the age of 18 and children under the age of 18 are not permitted to use the Services. More specifically, if we discover we have received any “personal information” (as defined under the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act) from a child under the age of 13 in violation of this Policy, we will take reasonable steps to delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe we have any information from or about anyone under the age of 13, please contact us at privacy@jabil.com.
