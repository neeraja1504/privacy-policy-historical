Privacy | Policies | Japan Travel
Last updated: July 23, 2018
At Japan Travel, your privacy is critically important to us and is guided by the following principles:
Your data is yours – we are thoughtful about the personal information we ask you to provide and the personal information that we collect about you through the operation of our services.
We store personal information for only as long as we have a reason to keep it.
We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what information in your profile is shared publicly (or kept private).
We aim for full transparency on how we gather, use, and share your personal information.
Our Privacy Policy below incorporates and clarifies these principles in more detail, and applies to all information that we collect about you across our website (www.japantravel.com), web store (shop.japantravel.com) and Japan Travel Bike (www.japantravel.bike)
How does Japan Travel collect data about me?
We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so – for example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better.
Basic Account Information: We ask for basic information from you in order to set up your account. For example, we require individuals who sign up for a Japan Travel account to provide your name and email address–and that’s it. You may provide us with more information–on your profile–but we don’t require that information to create a Japan Travel account.
Public Profile Information: If you have an account with us, we collect the information that you provide for your public profile. For example, if you have a Japan Travel account, your name is part of that public profile, along with any other information you put into your public profile, such as a photo or an “About Me” description. Your public profile information is just that–public–so please keep that in mind when deciding what information you would like to include.
Transaction and Billing Information: If you buy something from us—a tour or activity from our shop, or a custom tour requiring accommodation and/or transportation, for example—you will provide additional personal and payment information that is required to process the transaction and your payment, such as your name, credit card information, and contact information.
Customer Personal Information: We keep a portion of personal information provided by customers in travel requests and other transactions as personal data. Japan Travel also handles personal data entrusted to it by other travel companies in order to provide travel arrangements requested by those companies..
Communications with us: You may also provide us information when you respond to surveys, communicate with our support team, or apply for a role with us.
Technical, Usage and Location Information: We automatically collect information on how you interact with the Services, such as the IP address from which you access the Services, date and time, information about your browser, operating system and computer or device, pages viewed, and items clicked. We may also collect location information, including location information automatically provided by your computer or device. We use cookies and similar technologies to collect some of this information.
Sensitive Information

In cases where we may pass such sensitive information, such as a survey that you have completed as part of a campaign conducted by a third-party sponsor, we will always inform you that such information-sharing may occur. You will be able to decide for yourself whether to proceed or not.
When sensitive information is collected, used, or provided to a third party, Japan Travel takes special care in its handling so as not to collect, use, or provide information in a way that is not in accordance with the laws of Japan.
