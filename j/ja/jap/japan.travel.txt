Privacy Policy | Japan Travel | JNTO
Privacy Policy of Japan National Tourism Organisation (‘JNTO')
We strive to handle personal information in a manner which is consistent with the local privacy laws that apply in the various international jurisdictions in which JNTO operates.
Collection of personal information
The types of personal information that we collect will depend on the nature of your dealings with us. For example, we may collect personal information directly from you when you:
Subscribe to any of our publications or register to receive brochures;
Apply to attend or exhibit at a JNTO event, or enter a promotion or competition;
Have business dealings with us (whether as an employee of one of our external service providers, or if you work for any agencies or companies we deal with, or in the context of a transaction, or if you volunteer personal information to us).
We need to collect personal information so that we can provide you with the publications or services you have requested. The particular purpose for which we collect personal information will either be explained when we collect that information, or will be obvious from the context in which it is collected.
Access to personal information
You have the right to request access to any information held by JNTO, which relates to you. You also have the right to request the correction of any information which relates to you and is inaccurate. Any request for access or corrections should be advised to us in writing.

In general on our website, IP addresses are logged to track a user's session while the user remains anonymous.
