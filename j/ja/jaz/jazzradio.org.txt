8. Are Cookies used on our Site?
Cookies are used for a variety of reasons. We use Cookies to obtain information about the preferences of our Visitors and the Services they select. We also use Cookies for security purposes to protect our Authorized Customers. For example, if an Authorized Customer is logged on and our Site is unused for an extended period of time, we will automatically log the Authorized Customer off. * Many web browsers automatically contain an option that allows you to disable cookies. As a visitor to the JALC website, you may choose to disable cookies on your browser. However, if you choose to disable cookies, you will be unable to use certain functions on the JALC website. For example, customers who disable cookies will be unable to purchase tickets for JALC events online. *
JALC does not allow unrelated third parties to set cookies via JALC’s website.
JALC uses web beacons to monitor the activity of our email messages. Web beacons are electronic images that allow JALC’s email service provider to obtain information when an email is opened. When an e-mail is opened, the web beacon is able to obtain the computer’s IP address and the links that each user clicked within the e-mail. The information that JALC collects from web beacon technology is anonymous. The information is not personally identifiable because it does not specifically identify the individual user.
JALC employs various third parties to perform certain functions. These functions include sending postal mail and email, removing information from customer lists and processing credit card payments. The parties that JALC employs have access to personal information, only to the extent that it is necessary to perform their functions properly.

9. How does Jazz at Lincoln Center use Login Information?
We use login information, including but not limited to, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and browser types, to analyze trends, administer our Site, track Visitors’ movement and use, and gather broad demographic information.
10. How does Jazz at Lincoln Center keep Personally Identifiable Information Secure?
Our employees are familiar with this Policy and our security practices. The Personally Identifiable Information of our Visitors and Authorized Customers is only accessible to a limited number of authorized operators with access to said information.
We audit our security systems and processes on a regular basis. Sensitive information (such as, credit card numbers and Social Security Numbers) is secured by encryption protocols, put in place to protect Information sent over the Internet.

11. How do we handle Children’s Personally Identifiable Information? **
Our Site is directed to a general audience comprised primarily of adult users. Therefore, we do not typically collect Personally Identifiable Information from children under the age of 13. If Jazz at Lincoln Center creates online activities intended for children under the age of 13, the child will be able to access the activity without providing Personally Identifiable Information. For example, children may be allowed to access child-friendly activities online (subject to offering) by entering a username, or other non-personal login information.
If we intend to collect personal information from a child, we will take extra steps to protect the child’s privacy, including:
Notifying parents about the types of information that we collect from children, how the children’s information is used, and whether the children’s information is disclosed to third-parties.
Obtaining parental consent for the collection, use and disclosure of children’s information. We reasonably verify parental consent by requesting personally identifiable information from parents on portions of our Site or web-connected software applications intended only for adults. JALC may also verify parental consent by requiring children under the age of 13 to provide a parent or guardian’s direct e-mail address.
Giving parents the opportunity to access, review, edit, or delete the information that we have collected from their children. We also allow parents the opportunity to refuse further collection of information from their children. Moreover, any children’s information is generally stored as part of the corresponding adult’s account with Jazz at Lincoln Center, and can only be accessed by the adult account holder.
Limiting our collection of personal information from children to no more than is reasonably necessary to participate in an online activity.
