Privacy Policy
Is shopping on Jazp.com secure?
Absolutely. Our site uses the latest SSL encryption technology, which ensures that all data, including your personal information, remains private and secure.
We also use CyberSource, a secure global payment management platform, so you can use your credit card to shop at Jazp.com, completely stress-free.
Our Privacy Policy also explains everything else we do to keep your personal information secure, once received. Once you place an order the seller confirms receipt of the order and begins processing it.
Jazp.com gives a complete guarantee for the protection of privacy of site visitors and customers.

Site Statistics
We may disclose aggregate, anonymised statistics about the number of visitors to this Website or number of purchases made as required by our investors. We use an independent measurement and research company to gather data regarding the visitors to this Website on our behalf using cookies and a code which is embedded in the site. Both the cookies and the embedded code provide statistical information about visits to pages on the site, the duration of individual page view, paths taken by visitors through the site, data on visitors' screen settings and other general information. Jazp.com uses and stores this type of information, as with that obtained from other cookies used on the site, to help it improve the services to its users.

Protecting your security
We may use personal information provided by you in order to conduct appropriate anti-fraud checks. Personal information that you provide may be disclosed to a credit reference or fraud prevention agency, which may keep a record of that information. This is done only to confirm your identity - a credit check is not performed and your credit rating is unaffected.
Transfers of your Information The information that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the UAE. It may also be processed by staff operating outside the UAE who work for Jazp.com or one of our suppliers or agencies. Such processing may, for example, be required in order to fulfill your order, process your payment details or provide support services. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. We will do our best to protect your personal data, but cannot guarantee the security of data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access.
Disclosure of personal information  We may disclose your personal information to third parties:
If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our terms of; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Jazp.com, our customers, or others.

Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites.
Checking your Details
