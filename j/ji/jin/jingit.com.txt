Jingit - Privacy Policy
Jingit Privacy Policy
Introduction
Thank you for using the Jingit mobile applications or Jingit web properties such as https://www.jingit.com. The Jingit mobile applications (or “apps”) and Jingit web properties, are owned and operated by Jingit, LLC. (“Jingit”). Together or individually, as the context in this Privacy Policy requires, we refer to the Jingit apps and web properties as the “Jingit Service”. At Jingit, we understand the importance of your privacy and are building innovative methods to allow you to manage it. We are committed to protecting your privacy and keeping your experience on the Jingit Service secure, enjoyable, efficient and easy.
Personal Information Collected Through the Jingit Service
In an effort to make it easier and more rewarding for you to use the Jingit Service and access our services, when you register through the Jingit Service, we collect certain personally identifiable information (collectively, the “Personal Information”). For example, we may ask for certain basic information to complete and submit your application for various payment options (eGift cards, bank account linking, debit card linking, etc.), or in order to service your Jingit account or other accounts linked to Jingit. This information may include: your name, e-mail address, telephone number and payment information such as your bank account or credit card number. Additionally, Jingit may request information about what you like and do not like about the Jingit Service. By knowing your preferences, Jingit may provide services and other special offerings on a personalized basis. Any data provided during the registration process, including information that is provided by or acquired through a third party site, will become part of your Personal Information to the extent it identifies you personally and will become information owned by Jingit. Jingit utilizes secure encryption technology that is industry standard or higher to assure the privacy and security of any Personal Information you submit through the Jingit Service. Our legal advisors require us to add that no security technology or practice is infallible. Please see the section of this policy titled “Security of Personal Information” below.
As permitted under applicable law, we may use the information we collect through the Jingit Service for various other business purposes such as customer service, fraud prevention, market research, and improving our products and services. We may combine your Personal Information with other information that is publicly available or that we receive from other reputable sources. In addition, we may remove all the personally identifiable information from data we collect, and combine such anonymous data with other aggregated data compiled by Jingit for historical, research or statistical purposes. Because such anonymous aggregated data does not include Personal Information from which the identity of an individual can be determined, Jingit reserves the right to use aggregated data in any way it considers appropriate.
You may receive advertising, promotional and other similar materials from Jingit in print and/or electronic format, however your receipt of such promotional communications from Jingit is optional. In compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act, you will be given the opportunity to manage and unsubscribe from these promotional emails. IT IS Jingit’S POLICY TO NEVER SEND PROMOTIONAL MATERIALS TO CUSTOMERS THAT HAVE “OPTED-OUT” OF RECEIVING SUCH INFORMATION.
You may also receive notifications from Jingit in print and/or electronic format relating to actions or inactions that affect your account, or information we believe you should have concerning your account. We refer to these as “transactional notifications” and they may be triggered by your actions, actions taken on your behalf, the actions of others, or changes in the status of your account. Examples include notifications of: an email address verification or a password reset, a triggered thank you, a balance update, a re-engagement, or certain kinds of inaction by you. These notifications may be delivered in print or email or on a mobile device. While you may not have the opportunity to unsubscribe from transactional notifications, if you have questions about them, or you believe you are receiving notifications in error, please contact support.

We collect non-personal information about your use of the Jingit Service through the use of a standard technology referred to as “cookies.” Cookies allow Jingit to monitor the number of people using the Jingit Service to determine which aspects of the Jingit Service are most popular among visitors and users, to determine the length of time visitors and users access the Jingit Service, and to develop methods for improving the Jingit Service.
Most browsers offer instructions on how to reset the browser to reject cookies in the “Help” section of the toolbar. You must accept our cookies to use the Jingit Service. We do not, however, use cookies to collect or store Personal Information about you.

Use of Personal and Non-Personal Information
Any Personal Information that you submit to Jingit will only be used within Jingit’s domain. Any non-personal information that is automatically collected by Jingit will be maintained indefinitely by Jingit and used for Jingit’s internal business and marketing purposes, such as assessing site usage and traffic patterns. No Personal Information collected by Jingit via the Jingit Service will be sold or otherwise disclosed to third parties; provided, however, Jingit reserves the right to disclose any information in its possession if it is required to do so by law, or if Jingit determines that such disclosure is necessary to comply with applicable law, or to defend its rights or property, or to respond to an emergency situation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Jingit may disclose your Personal Information to third parties for marketing purposes if you have opted in to such disclosure. If Jingit sells one of its product lines or divisions, your Personal Information may be transferred to the buyer so that the buyer can continue to provide you with information and services. If Jingit provides your Personal Information to individuals and entities which assist us with our business activities, it is Jingit’s practice to require those individuals and entities to keep your Personal Information confidential and to use your Personal Information only to perform functions for Jingit.
In the event that you opt to share personally identifiable information with a sponsor, such as a reward account number associated with that sponsor, Jingit will allow that sponsor to use the shared information for its own business purposes.
We may also use third parties to facilitate our business. In connection with these business operations, our service providers may have access to your Personal Information for use for a limited time in connection with these business activities. Where we utilize third parties for the processing of any Personal Information, we implement reasonable contractual and technical protections limiting the use of that information to the Jingit-specified purposes.
