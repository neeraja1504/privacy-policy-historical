Privacy Policy
This policy was last updated on July 31, 2007.
Selling to Big Companies, a Leapfrog Strategies company, takes your privacy seriously. We strive to keep your personal and financial information totally secure. To that end, we have prepared this privacy policy to disclose and describe our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website.
We pledge to hold all information you provide to us in absolute privacy.
We do not sell, rent, loan, or give your email address or other personal information to anybody and will never do so.
We will NEVER sell or rent your name or personal information to any third party without your express permission.
Use of Your Personal Information
If you subscribe, your email address will be used to send the Selling to Big Companies newsletter. Special offers are sometimes sent to subscribers as well on behalf of third parties. But these third parties do not have access to your information since we alone send out the emails. However, all recipients of the newsletter may opt-out of receiving future newsletters or offers when so desired, and are given opportunity to opt-out of these emails at any time.
We may also use personal information in a manner that does not identify you specifically nor allow you to be contacted but does identify certain criteria about our users in general. For example, we may inform third parties about the number of subscribers to the newsletter, open rates and website pages most frequently browsed.
Only authorized employees may access your information. All employees are required to adhere to our strict privacy policies and any employee who violates the privacy policy is subject to termination and other disciplinary measures, up to being criminally prosecuted for their violation.
Aside from these uses of user information, we do not sell, nor plan to sell any user information to anyone.
