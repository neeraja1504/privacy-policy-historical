This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) applies to those who visit the websites owned and operated by the Company, download any downloadable software, install any mobile applications, and/or use the Company’s products and Jivochat Service offered at jivochat.com, jivochat.com.br, jivochat.es, jivochat.de, jivochat.ng, jivochat.co.ke, jivochat.co.za, jivochat.mx, jivochat.co.id, jivochat.com.co, jivochat.com.ar, jivochat.com.pe, jivochat.cl, jivochat.com.bo, jivochat.com.ve, jivochat.co.in, jivochat.pt (collectively, the “Jivochat Service”).

This might be by reference to an identifier such as a name, ID number, location data or online identifier, or by factors specific to them, such as their physical, genetic, economic or social identity.

The capitalized terms used in this Policy but not defined herein shall have the same meaning assigned to them in Company’s Terms and Conditions (jivochat.com/terms) (the “Terms”).
NOTICE TO SUBSCRIBER’S OBJECTS :  If a Subscriber uses the Jivochat Service to interact with other individuals, such as the Subscriber’s customers or potential customers (the “Subscriber’s Objects”), the Subscriber is solely responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable laws in connection with the collection and/or processing of personal data of the Subscriber’s Objects.  If you are a Subscriber’s Object please note that the Company has no relationship with you whatsoever and its only relation is with the Subscriber with whom you may interact.  For any questions regarding the collection of your personal data or to amend your personal data, and for all other reasons, you must contact the Subscriber.

To the extent that the Company suffers any losses as a result of the breach by the Subscriber of the foregoing obligations or failure to abide by the foregoing obligations, the Subscriber shall hold harmless and shall fully indemnify the Company from such losses. The Company is not responsible for the content of any personal data of Subscriber Objects or any other information that is stored on the Company’s or its third party suppliers’ servers at the discretion of the Subscriber.  The Company owes no responsibility and bears no liability vis a vis the Subscriber’s Objects.  If you need a signed Data Processing Agreement in addition to this Policy and the Terms, please contact us at privacy@jivochat.com.
