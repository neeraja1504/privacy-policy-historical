Privacy Statement:
If information is being gathered about you, we believe you have the right to know about it.
JigsawADay.com does not collect personal information on its website visitors including as names, addresses, or email addresses except as you specifically permit. This information will be used only for business purposes relating to your purchases, information or notifications as described below.
We hate spam as much as you do, and as such we will not mail you except as required for information regarding changes to the website, or updates and announcements such as specials, CD-ROMS, bonus puzzles including those offered by a 'Tell A Friend' button, etc. (Note: Using a 'Tell A Friend' button will automatically send you an e-mail containing a link to extra 'reward' puzzles, and an e-mail describing the site to the 'friend' you enter. The 'friend's e-mail address is not recorded by us unless THEY give us their address.) In all cases we will try to keep it to once a month or less but reserve the right to mail you more often if circumstances require it.
In any case, you will always have the ability to opt out of our list and removal instructions will be included at the bottom of any e-mails we send you, including e-mails generated by 'Tell A Friend' buttons as described above.
PayPal and Google Base - We collect payments for our CD-ROMs through both PayPal and Google Base, as well as use Google for advertising, and PayPal for collection of donations through programs such as the 'Buy me a cup of coffee' buttons (The donations are greatly appreciated!).

Google.com defines a cookie as "A 'cookie' is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the website again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information.

You can also Google 'cookie cleaners' and find many free programs there. Our favorite program is CCleaner. It is free and does a better job than some paid programs we have seen.
We will also, from time to time, use other advertising sources such as Commission Junction or the Share-A-Sale network. You can Google these businesses for more information.
