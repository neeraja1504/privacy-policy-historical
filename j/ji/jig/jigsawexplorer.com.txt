Privacy Policy
Email Addresses
You may choose to provide your email address to be notified of specific events, such as the release of Jigsaw Explorer mobile apps and the availability of a white label edition of Jigsaw Explorer’s puzzle player. Collected email addresses will only be used for the stated notification purpose for which they were provided. We do not share these email addresses with anyone outside of Jigsaw Explorer and SendLoop (unless they were to be requested by law enforcement). SendLoop is the email service which we use to implement our email lists. See the SendLoop privacy policy for more information. If you wish to have your email address removed from our lists then send us an email at .
If you communicate with us by email then your email, including the reply-to email address, will reside in our email storage. The reply-to email address will only be used to reply to email inquiries and will not be shared outside of Jigsaw Explorer and Microsoft (unless they were to be requested by law enforcement). Microsoft will necessarily have access to the reply-to email address because we use Microsoft’s Office 365 online service to manage our email. See Microsoft’s privacy statement for more information.
Cookies
Jigsaw Explorer uses Google Analytics to measure its website traffic. Google Analytics stores cookies through the Jigsaw Explorer website as part of its implementation. Note that Google Analytic’s cookies do not contain any personally identifiable information. You can find detailed information about Google Analytics’ use of cookies on the Google Partners page and on the Google Privacy Policy page.
Jigsaw Explorer’s web pages contain Facebook “Like” buttons which involve the use of cookies from Facebook. More information on Facebook cookies can be found in Facebook’s Cookies Policy.
Jigsaw Explorer uses cookies to store your jigsaw puzzle data. This data is primarily used to save puzzle progress so you can return to unfinished puzzles at a later time. The puzzle data cookies do not contain personally identifiable information.
Jigsaw Explorer also uses cookies when displaying advertisements. See the advertisements section further below for more information.
Error Reports
Occasionally, Jigsaw Explorer’s puzzle player might encounter an error caused by a bug in the browser, in a browser plug-in, or in the puzzle player program itself. In those instances the puzzle program automatically sends error data in the background to the Errorception error tracking service. Our Support personnel can then examine the resulting error report and use the information it contains to determine the cause of the error and apply a fix to the puzzle program if needed. The error report contains information such as computer operating system version, browser brand and version, and log information showing the type and code location of the error as well as information regarding the state of the puzzle program leading up to the error. The error reports contain no personally identifiable information.
In the event of an error, the user’s IP address is part of the error data sent to Errorception. The IP address is anonymized by Errorception so that it cannot be used to personally identify the user. The IP address is not stored. For more information see Errorception’s privacy policy.
