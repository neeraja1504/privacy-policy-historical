Information Collection and Use
Information Collected Upon Registration: When you create or reconfigure a Jigsaw Planet account, you provide some personal information, such as your username, password, and email address.

Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type, the referring domain and pages visited. Other actions, such as interactions with advertisements, may also be included in Log Data.
Links: Jigsaw Planet may keep track of how you interact with links by redirecting clicks or through other means. We do this to help improve our Services, including advertising, and to be able to share aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on.
Cookies: Like many websites, we use "cookie" technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve our Services. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer's hard disk. Jigsaw Planet may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to improve our Services.

Current versions of web browsers offer enhanced user controls of cookies (disabling, removing).

In particular, Google uses the DoubleClick DART cookie to enable it and its partners to serve ads to our users based on their visit to our sites and/or other sites on the Internet. Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google advertising opt-out page.
