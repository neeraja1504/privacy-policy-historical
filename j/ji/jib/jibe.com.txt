1. Information We Collect
Information you provide to “Jibe sites”:
Visitors can browse most areas on our website and our mobile products without providing any personal information. However, certain interactions with us may require personal information. For example, we may collect and retain your name, address, phone number and e-mail address, if you request a demo from our website or contact us for information about our products or services. If we provide forums, blogs, or bulletins that allow for user-generated content, then we may also collect and retain personal information that you provide in relation to such content. If you correspond with us by email, we may retain the content of your email messages, your email address and our responses.
Information That Customers Provide to Us Through “Jibe Enterprise Services”:
In providing Jibe Enterprise Services, we collect, store, process, and disclose personal information belonging to individuals who are involved in recruiting or employment activities with our Customers (e.g., job applicants, job referrers, an applicant’s social-networking connections who are employed by a Customer). In all of these cases, our software has been integrated into a Customer Recruiting System and we are handling personal information solely on behalf of the Customer, and in accordance with our agreements with the Customer.
If you are interacting in recruiting or employment contexts with one of our Customers, please review the Customer’s privacy policy, terms of use or other notices to learn more about the Customer’s information practices, including its use of service providers like Jibe. For your information, here are some examples of how Jibe collects and uses information in the course of providing Jibe Enterprise Services to our Customers:
Jibe Enterprise Services may facilitate the job application process through the Customer’s Customer Recruiting System, and in that capacity Jibe may receive personal information of individuals (i.e., job applicants) requested by the Customer’s application, including for example, an individual’s name, contact information, and employment history. Jibe handles this information solely on behalf of the Customer and our use, retention and deletion of the personal information is governed by our agreements with the Customer.
Jibe Enterprise Services may request contact information from your friends as part of the Service we provide to our Customers. For example, our Customers may provide an invitation service for individuals to share job listings with each other or to request referrals. If you utilize these features, you will input another person’s name and email address and we or our third party service providers will send an email or message via your social network to this person on your behalf. Jibe may store this information on behalf of our Customer to send this email or message, to provide the Service to our Customer, and to track the success of this Service. The individual invited to this Service may contact us at this link to request that we remove this information from our database.
Information Collected Through Technology:
Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies: Technologies such as cookies and similar technologies are used by Jibe and our partners, affiliates, or analytics or service providers, including those who provide targeted advertising and marketing. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users’ movements around the site, serving targeted advertising on our site or on other sites around the Web, and gathering demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.
Log File Information: Log file information is automatically reported by every browser each time a web page is accessed. When visitors browse Jibe Sites, or in the course of our providing Jibe Enterprise Services to Customers, our servers automatically record certain information that web browsers send whenever websites are visited or services are accessed. These server logs may include information such as the type of web request, the computer’s Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. We may link this automatically collected data to other information we collect about you.
Jibe Enterprise Services allow Customers to provide individuals (e.g., job applicants) the ability to use information from social networking sites (e.g., Facebook, LinkedIn). If you utilize this feature, then you are giving us permission to collect and share information about you, your friends, and your contacts (which may also include information such as your profile picture, interests, work experience, and education) to provide Jibe Enterprise Services to our Customer. You should always review the social networking site’s privacy policy, terms of use or other notices, as well as your privacy settings with the social networking site, to learn more about the site’s information practices (e.g., what information the site allows third parties to access).
