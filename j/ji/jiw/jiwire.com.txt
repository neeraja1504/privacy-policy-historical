Information Collection
We automatically collect and receive information about users such as, but not limited to, browser identifiers, session information, advertising identifiers (such as IDFA and AAID), device type, carrier provider, IP addresses, carrier user ID, precise geo-location information, sites visited and clicks on advertisements we display.
We use cookies and web beacons in connection with our advertising technology platform. Web beacons are invisibly embedded electronic images and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. These technologies help us to deliver ad, count impressions, and understand usage activity of users. We use cookies to store this type of information when we serve ads onto Internet browsers. For more information about cookies and web beacons, please visit:  http://www.allaboutcookies.org/cookies/.
When you visit our website, we do not link the information we store in cookies to any personal information you may submit through our website, www.ninthdecimal.com.
How We Use and Disclose Information
NinthDecimal uses the collected information to target and display advertisements that may be of interest to you. We may also use the information to help measure the effectiveness of advertising campaign and similar market research programs. And where we are able to infer that one or more browsers or devices are from the same user or household, we will link those browsers and devices into a device graph.
NinthDecimal does not knowingly use information on our platform that comes from what we consider to be sensitive health information. We may use health-related segments that are inferred from data we collect but are not derived from sensitive health data (e.g. we don’t use things like medical records).  Click here for a list of the standard health-related segments that may be used in NinthDecimals’s Platform.
We may provide the collected information to our subsidiaries, third party partners and agents to improve advertisement targeting, make and create offers, provide reporting to advertisers and clients, and to improve our systems and products.
We may onboard additional information from clients into our data set to help those clients obtain additional insights about their customers and prospective customers.
Opting Out
If you don’t want the information we collect used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads while you access the third-party applications of our mobile partners, we offer a number of choice mechanisms. We generally don’t respond to browser based Do Not Track signals. Please note that none of our choice mechanisms will opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads but they won’t be targeted by us and we will remove opted out browsers or devices from our ad targeting device graph. Your opt-out choice will be applied only to the browser or device that has opted out.
AdChoices Icon
In Ad Opt-Out .  You may opt-out by selecting the Ad Choices icon within an advertisement targeted by NinthDecimal and following the instructions.
TRUSTe Privacy Application Opt-Out .  You may also opt-out of targeted advertisements on mobile applications from NinthDecimal by using the TRUSTe Privacy Application; you may download the TRUSTe Privacy Application by visiting your App Store, or by clicking here for Apple iOS or here for Android..

To exercise this opt-out, please visit the privacy settings of your Android or iOS device and select “limit ad tracking” (Apple iOS) or “opt-out of interest based ads” (Android). For devices where we are able to see that such a selection has been made, we will not use information collection from that device to deliver targeted advertising.
Mobile Location Choices. If you’d like to adjust your setting regarding the use of precise location data by third parties such as NinthDecimal, you may do so via your device settings. Also, most mobile applications that collect precise location information offer mechanisms to control the collection and use of precise location information. Please note that these choice mechanisms won’t impact previously collected precise location information that has been de-identified. Also, by turning off location-based services, you will lose all the benefits of those location-based services on your phone.
Browser based Opt-Out. If you’d like to opt-out of receiving targeted ads from NinthDecimal via your browser, please click  here and TRUSTe will drop an opt-out cookie on your browser. The opt-out cookie tells our systems not to serve targeted advertising to that browser. Please note that if you delete your cookies, you may need to renew this opt-out choice.

NinthDecimal retains the data it collects through its advertising solution for a period of up to 13 months. After this time the data is anonymized, aggregated and then stored for analytical purposes.

Tracking Technologies / Cookies

We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.
We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. The use of cookies by our partners is not covered by our privacy statement.

Clear gifs have a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages.

17. General.
All matters relating to your access to and use of the Site are governed in all respects by the laws of the State of California as such laws are applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within California between California residents, without reference to conflicts of law provisions. You and NinthDecimal each agree to attempt in good faith to resolve any bona fide controversy or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Site by confidential mediation under the then-current CPR Mediation Procedure before resorting to arbitration. Mediation of the controversy or claim will be conducted on an agreed date by a single, agreed upon, independent mediator in San Francisco, California, or another agreed location. Any bona fide controversy or claim not resolved within a reasonable period of time by discussion or mediation will be finally resolved by confidential, binding arbitration in accordance with the CPR Institute for Dispute Resolution Rules for Non-Administered Arbitration by a sole arbitrator appointed in accordance with those rules. Any such controversy or claim shall be arbitrated on an individual basis, and will not be consolidated in any arbitration with any claim or controversy of any other party. The place of the arbitration will be San Francisco County, California (unless you and NinthDecimal otherwise agree prior to the initiation of the arbitration). The arbitration will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Section 1-16, and judgment on the arbitration award may be entered into by any court having jurisdiction thereof. The award of the arbitrator will be final and binding upon the parties without appeal or review except as permitted by California law. The arbitrator will not be empowered to award damages in excess of compensatory damages. Any claim by either party will be time-barred unless that party commences the arbitration within one year after the claim arises, provided that this time limit shall be tolled during any discussion or mediation of the claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek any interim or preliminary relief from a court of competent jurisdiction in San Francisco County, California as necessary to protect the party’s rights or property pending the completion of arbitration. By using the Site, you consent and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located in San Francisco County, California. If any portion of these Terms is deemed unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction or an arbitrator, then that portion will be enforced to the maximum extent possible and the remaining portions of these Terms will be given full effect. NinthDecimal’s failure to act in a particular circumstance does not waive the ability to act with respect to that circumstance or similar circumstances. NinthDecimal will be excused for any failure to perform to the extent that its performance is prevented by any reason outside of its control. No agency, partnership, joint venture, employment or franchise relationship is intended or created by these Terms. NinthDecimal may require registration or payment to continue use of any aspect of the Site at any time. These Terms constitute the entire agreement, and supersede the provisions of any other agreements or understandings (oral or written), between the parties with respect to your access to and use of the Site and the subject matter of these Terms.
