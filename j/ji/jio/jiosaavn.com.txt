International Transfers
JioSaavn is a global business headquartered in the United States. JioSaavn processes, transfers and stores information about its users on servers located in the United States, India and Singapore. As a result, JioSaavn may transfer your information with third parties located in countries other than your home country. Your personal information may therefore be subject to privacy laws that are different from those in your country of residence.
If you are located in India, the European Economic Area (“EEA”), Canada or elsewhere outside of the United States, please be aware that information we collect may be transferred to and processed by third parties in a country outside of your country of residence.

We may transfer your personal information outside the EEA:
in order to store it;
in order to enable us to provide goods or services to you and fulfil our contract with you. This includes order fulfilment, processing of payment details, and the provision of support services;
where we are legally required to do so;
in order to facilitate the operation of our group of businesses, where it is in our legitimate interests and we have concluded these are not overridden by your rights.
Where your personal data is transferred outside the EEA we will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that this data is subject to appropriate and required safeguards. Some non-EEA countries are recognized by the European Commission as having an “adequate” level of data protection according to the standards set by the European Commission. For a list of these non-EAA countries with adequate safeguards and how the European Commission came to this determination click here.
For data transfers from the EEA to non-EEA countries that are not considered to have adequate data protection measures, JioSaavn has instituted other legal and contractual measures to protect your personal data. In particular, JioSaavn requires that the non-EEA recipient be bound by the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses to protect your personal data.
