COOKIES AND AUTOMATIC DATA COLLECTION TOOLS
The Website uses certain tools, such as cookies, to automatically collect Data. A cookie is a small text file that is used to store information on a user's Internet browser or a user's computer's hard drive when the user visits a website, such as the Website. A cookie does not contain information that identifies a person, but it allows for the linking of a user's computer to the information provided by the user on the Website (such as, for example, linking a user's IP address and other information about the user's experience on the Website to his/her preferences expressed while choosing services and purchasing products offered through the Website). Cookies are disseminated by servers and no one may gain access to information contained therein. The information stored in cookies is gathered directly and automatically by the Website and is processed in an aggregate and anonymous manner.
The use of cookies and other automatic data collection tools is necessary for the proper functioning of the Website and its services. In the event a user disables cookies, Jimmy Choo cannot ensure that all web pages of the Website will be displayed and/or that certain services will be supplied.
JIMMY CHOO uses the following types of cookies:

2. ANALYTICAL COOKIES: These cookies are used to measure and analyse how the visitors use the Website (for example site traffic, total sales through the Website, the pages visitors go to most often and pages from which the visitors get error messages) in order to continuously improve the Website and the shopping experiences offered through the Website.

They also may enable us (or third-party advertising services we work with) to track the actions of users online over time and across different websites or platforms to measure statistics of our marketing efforts, and to deliver electronic advertisements that may be more relevant to individual consumers and that will improve the overall consumer experience.
