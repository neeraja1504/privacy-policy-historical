Security
Although we may provide certain encryption technologies and use other reasonable precautions to protect your confidential information and provide suitable security, we do not and cannot guarantee or warrant that any information transmitted through the Internet is secure, or that such transmissions are free from delay, interruption, interception or error.
The federal government and technology industry have developed practical tips (available at www.onguardonline.gov/) to help you guard against Internet fraud, secure your computer and protect your personal information.
Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for the "Verified and Secured" badge located in the website footer, or looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the web page.
While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.
Data Retention
We will retain and use your Personal Information for as long as is needed for us to be able to provide our products and services to you, and as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, comply with our internal business practices and standards, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Personal Information is destroyed when it is no longer necessary for these purposes. Our business partners and third-party service providers may have their own data retention policies.

Choices with Your Personal Information and Opting Out
Whether you submit any Personal Information to us is entirely up to you. You are under no obligation to provide any Personal Information to us. However, this information is essential for the provision and quality of some of the services that we offer to you, so we cannot provide you with certain services or provide you with access to certain features if you choose to withhold requested information.
You may choose to prevent us from disclosing or using your Personal Information under certain circumstances ("opt out"). You may opt out of any disclosure or use of your Personal Information for purposes that are incompatible with the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected or for which you subsequently gave authorization by notifying us by one of the methods escribed at the end of this Privacy Policy, or by following the procedures set forth in an electronic communication from us, if applicable. Furthermore, even where your Personal Information is to be disclosed and used in accordance with the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy, you may elect to opt out of such disclosure to and use by a third party that is not acting as our agent. There are some uses from which you cannot opt out, such as to provide products, features or services that you have requested from us.
Please note that making such requests does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of your content. For example, we may retain the information for our own internal records in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.
