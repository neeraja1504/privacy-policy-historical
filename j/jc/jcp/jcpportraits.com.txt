How does Lifetouch use the personal information it collects about me?
We responsibly limit the use and disclosure of your personal information. We may use your personal information for the following purposes:
to provide the products or services or benefits you request, or information about them,
to produce and deliver photographic products and services per our agreement with the organization you are affiliated with, as applicable,
to develop and improve our products and services,
to improve the content of our site and the services we provide, and their usefulness to you,
to deliver Lifetouch  marketing communications and promotional materials that may be of interest to you, and
to protect the security or integrity of our databases or website, to take precautions against liability, and to detect and remediate violations of our Terms & Condition or other misuse of the Site.
If you upload Your Content to a Site, it remains your property.  Lifetouch will only use Your Content to fulfill your orders and otherwise as directed by you.
Please be assured that Lifetouch does not use its customers’ photographs in marketing or advertising materials without first obtaining a release from the photo subject (or, in the case of a minor, the photo subject’s parent or legal representative).
Lifetouch does not sell, trade or share your personal information with unaffiliated third parties for their marketing purposes.
We do share your personal information within Lifetouch and with J.C. Penney Company Inc.  for the purposes described in this Policy.  We may also share this information with third parties who provide support services to us such as helping us fulfill customer orders, process credit card orders and the like. If so, these parties are authorized to use the personal information solely in conjunction with the specific service they provide to or on behalf of Lifetouch.
We may also be required to share or transfer your personal information in other, limited circumstances, for example, to respond to judicial process, to comply with state, federal or local laws, to protect the security or integrity of our databases or website, to take precautions against liability, in the event of a corporate reorganization or, to the extent required by law, to provide information to law enforcement agencies.
What choices do I have about your use of my personal information?
Our goal is to inform you about our products and services, including special promotions and coupons. However, if you are contacted and do not wish to receive further information, you may contact us at the phone number listed below, or for email: select unsubscribe at the bottom of the email.

We will act promptly to honor your request. Please allow 7-10 business days for your record to update in our system. However, even if we remove your information from use in our marketing programs, you may still receive offers and other promotional materials from Affiliated Companies, or from outside vendors or service providers who obtained your information before we received your request or from another source.
How can I review and update the personal information you have about me?
If you would like to review, correct or delete your personal information, or if you are the parent or legal guardian of a minor and would like to review, correct or delete that minor's personal information, you may be able to do so by logging into your account with the Site.  If not, please contact us as noted below (see For further information).  There may be times when we are unable to fulfill your request - for example, if providing access to your personal information would reveal confidential commercial or proprietary information or personal information about someone else (and we cannot separate your data), if we are prohibited by law from disclosing the information or if we have a legal obligation to retain certain data. We may require additional personal information from you for the purposes of verifying your identity and rights.
How does Lifetouch safeguard personal information?
Lifetouch has implemented safeguards reasonably designed to protect against unauthorized access and disclosures of personal information under its control, including appropriate technical, physical and administrative safeguards and security measures. A comprehensive set of IT policies based on ISO 27001/2 governs information systems practices and procedures throughout the Lifetouch enterprise, and Lifetouch maintains third party certification of its compliance with the stringent Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard.  Please be advised, however, that despite these measures, no website, application, database or system is completely secure or “hacker proof”; accordingly, we cannot guarantee that our information security safeguards will never be compromised.
