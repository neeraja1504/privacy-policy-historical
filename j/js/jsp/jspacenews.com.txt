Cookies and Web Beacons
Jspace News, like many websites, uses cookies to prepare customized Web pages for you. A cookie is a file containing a string of code that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive, to be kept there for later use. With cookies in place, whenever you use your Web browser (such as Internet Explorer, Chrome, AOL or Mozilla Firefox) to connect to Jspace News, our systems are able to recognize you. This enables Jspace News to present you with custom Web pages. So, for example, instead of seeing just a generic welcome page, you see a welcome page with your name on it and information that relates to where you live (your ZIP code) and products or services that reflect your interests.
In addition to Jspace News’ cookies, when you visit Jspace News your computer may receive cookies from our advertisers and from other sites displayed as search results or links.

No personal information is transmitted through web beacons.
