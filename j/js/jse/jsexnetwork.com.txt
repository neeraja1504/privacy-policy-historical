All information is confidential and will never be sold or disclosed to a third party.
Encrypted Credit Card Purchases
When you use a credit card to purchase a JSexNetwork.com subscription, the credit card number is encrypted as it passes over the Internet. Your credit card number is not kept or recorded on our computers - it is simply passed through to the credit card company to purchase the subscription. In addition, we are sensitive to the fact that some users are uncomfortable submitting their credit card number over the Internet, no matter how secure the environment.

You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this different manner.

** Disclosure of personal information will be made available to others on the ground that you purposely perform a credit card chargeback or a payment gateway credit on your member subscription based on our suspicion that you are deliberately trying to scam, or download for free at JSexNetwork.com or at its affiliated sites. We will not tolerate payment gateway abuse.
