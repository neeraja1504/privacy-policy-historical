Web Beacons/Web Bugs
JM Bullion may utilize a software technology called “clear gifs” (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to “Cookies,” and are used to track the online movements of users. In contrast to “Cookies,” which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customer’s personal information. Rather, we may use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.
From time to time, JM Bullion may release traffic data and information gathered using “Cookies” in the aggregate, such as by publishing a report on trends in the usage of the Website.
Google Analytics
JM Bullion use Google Analytics remarketing codes to log when users view specific pages or take specific actions on a website. This allows us to provide targeted advertising in the future. If you do not wish to receive this type of advertising from us in the future you can opt out using the DoubleClick opt-out page (http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/) or the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page (http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/).
JM Bullion also utilizes Google Analytics Demographics and Interests Reporting.  Using the Ad Settings (https://www.google.com/settings/u/0/ads/authenticated), you can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads.
3. SHARING OF PERSONAL/NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION
JM Bullion may share your information where complying or in good faith attempting to comply with any law, regulation or law enforcement request; where JM Bullion has obtained your consent; where sharing or disclosure of your information is necessary between JM Bullion’s parents, subsidiaries, successors, assigns, licensees, affiliates, or business partners; where JM Bullion has been purchased by a third party; where sharing or disclosure of your information is necessary to respond to requests by government authorities; where your information is demanded by a court order or subpoena; where sharing or disclosure of your information is needed to protect the employees, independent contractors, officers, directors, members, users, or shareholders of JM Bullion; and where sharing or disclosure of your information is needed to help prevent against fraud or the violation of any applicable law, statute, regulation, ordinance, or treaty.  Without limiting the above, in an effort to respect your privacy, JM Bullion will maintain an email database, in-house, and will never sell your data or otherwise make it available for unaffiliated third party marketing purposes.
JM Bullion may also disclose personal information to those who help it provide products and services, including those who perform technical, administrative and data processing tasks, such as hosting, fulfillment, and data storage and security.

4. CONSENT TO RECEIVE EMAIL AND PROMOTIONAL MATERIALS
By establishing an account, making a purchase or registering to receive the JM Bullion Newsletter, you consent to receive periodic commercial/promotional email communications from us. You may opt-out of receiving such promotional communications at any time by following the unsubscribe instructions contained in each email, or by contacting our customer service department. By unsubscribing from our Promotional Newsletter only, you may still receive promotional materials and transactional emails from us in the future.
5. STORAGE AND SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
Your personal information is stored and processed on computers and servers in the United States and, through your use of the Website, you unequivocally consent to the processing and storage of your personal information.
JM Bullion transmits information via the highest industry standard secure server (SSL) provided by Trustwave. This SSL creates the secure and encrypted https:// Website address for our important pages like Checkout and the My Account area. When you see the https:// website address, you know the information you are in-putting is protected and secure.
We comply with payment card industry data security standards that require merchants to implement security measures for credit card information. We never have access to your credit card information, as it is processed securely following the most stringent PCI-compliant standards. This ensures in the extremely unlikely case the JM Bullion servers are compromised, your financial details would not be accessible.
We have implemented and maintain generally accepted industry standards to protect against the unauthorized access, use, modification, destruction or disclosure of your personal information both during transmission and once we receive it. The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information during the registration process, we encrypt that information using state-of-the-art technology. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
JM Bullion assures you that we will use your personal information only for the purposes stated in the  Terms of Use Agreement and this Privacy Policy. We will not otherwise rent or sell your personal information to unaffiliated third parties, and we will prevent your email address from being recorded by “web crawlers” or “web spiders” to the best of our ability. If you believe that your email address has been recorded in this way, please let us know immediately.
The time periods for which we retain your personal information depend on the purposes for which we use it. JM Bullion will keep your personal information for as long as you are a registered user of our products and, thereafter, for no longer than is reasonably necessary for internal reporting and reconciliation purposes pursuant to legal requirements and to provide you with any feedback or information you might request or require.
If you have any questions about security on our Website, you can email us at support@jmbullion.com.
