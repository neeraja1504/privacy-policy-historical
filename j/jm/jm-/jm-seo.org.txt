reCAPTCHA Data
The reCAPTCHA SPAM protection feature analyzes traffic, potentially containing Users’ Personal Data, with the purpose of filtering it from parts of traffic, messages and content that are recognized as SPAM.
Google reCAPTCHA is a SPAM protection service provided by Google Inc.
The use of reCAPTCHA is subject to the Google privacy policy and terms of use. You acknowledge and understand that the reCAPTCHA API works by collecting hardware and software information, such as device and application data, and sending these data to Google for analysis. The information collected in connection with your use of the Service (such as cookies and usage data) will be used for improving reCAPTCHA and for general security purposes. It will not be used for personalized advertising by Google.
YouTube
We have embedded YouTube videos on our site, which allows you to view content hosted on external platforms directly from the pages of this Service and interact with them. The embedded videos might still collect web traffic data for the pages where they are installed, even when users do not use it. YouTube is a video content visualization service provided by Google Inc. that allows this Service to incorporate content of this kind on its pages.
The personal Data collected includes cookies and usage data and the place of processing is in the United States. Please see Google’s Privacy Policy for more information.

Redirection
We use the Redirection plugin to help make your browsing experience seamless and more enjoyable. Please see this link for the developer’s Privacy Policy.
Site Backups – UpdraftPlus
We use the UpdraftPlus plugin as one of the ways we perform site backups. We will not delete information out of our website backups, because this becomes technically difficult to accomplish. However, our backups are stored in a safe place, including Google Drive. Please see this page for more information specifically on this. These links also offer additional information on the Google Privacy Policy and on UpdraftPlus.
Site Backups – Hosting Provider
Our hosting provider also provides us with backup functionalities for our Service.
Bootstrap
Our Service links to the third-party Bootstrap CSS in order to improve the layout of our site for visitors.
Wordfence Data
We use the Wordfence plugin to help with site security. To help you understand which cookies the Wordfence plugin sets, when in use on this Service, please see below. Wordfence currently sets three cookies and the below explains what each cookie does, who will have the cookie set, and why the cookie helps secure our Service. You can read Wordfence’s privacy policy here.
wfwaf-authcookie-(hash)
What it does: This cookie is used by the Wordfence firewall to perform a capability check of the current user before our Service has been loaded.
Who gets this cookie: This is only set for users that are able to log into our Service.
How this cookie helps: This cookie allows the Wordfence firewall to detect logged in users and allow them increased access. It also allows Wordfence to detect non-logged in users and restrict their access to secure areas. The cookie also lets the firewall know what level of access a visitor has to help the firewall make smart decisions about who to allow and who to block.
wf_loginalerted_(hash)
What it does: This cookie is used to notify the Wordfence admin when an administrator logs in from a new device or location.
Who gets this cookie: This is only set for administrators.
How this cookie helps: This cookie helps site owners know whether there has been an admin login from a new device or location.
wfCBLBypass
What it does: Wordfence offers a feature for a site visitor to bypass country blocking by accessing a hidden URL. This cookie helps track who should be allowed to bypass country blocking.
Who gets this cookie: When a hidden URL defined by the site admin is visited, this cookie is set to verify the user can access the site from a country restricted through country blocking. This will be set for anyone who knows the URL that allows bypass of standard country blocking. This cookie is not set for anyone who does not know the hidden URL to bypass country blocking.
How this cookie helps: This cookie gives site owners a way to allow certain users from blocked countries, even though their country has been blocked.
Google Fonts
The Google Fonts API is designed to limit the collection, storage, and use of end-user data to what is needed to serve fonts efficiently.
Use of Google Fonts is unauthenticated. No cookies are sent by website visitors to the Google Fonts API. Requests to the Google Fonts API are made to resource-specific domains, such as fonts.googleapis.com or fonts.gstatic.com, so that your requests for fonts are separate from and do not contain any credentials you send to google.com while using other Google services that are authenticated, such as Gmail.
In order to serve fonts quickly and efficiently with the fewest requests, responses are cached by the browser to minimize round-trips to the Google servers.
Requests for CSS assets are cached for 1 day. This allows Google to update a stylesheet to point to a new version of a font file when it’s updated, and ensures that all websites using fonts hosted by the Google Fonts API will be using the most updated version of each font within 24 hours of each release.
The font files themselves are cached for one year, which cumulatively has the effect of making the entire web faster: When millions of websites all link to the same fonts, they are cached after visiting the first website and appear instantly on all other subsequently visited sites. Google does sometimes update font files to reduce their file size, increase coverage of languages, and improve the quality of their design. The result is that website visitors send very few requests to Google: Google only sees 1 CSS request per font family, per day, per browser.
Google Fonts logs records of the CSS and the font file requests, and access to this data is kept secure. Aggregate usage numbers track how popular font families are, and are published on the Google Fonts analytics page. Google Fonts uses data from Google’s web crawler to detect which websites use Google fonts. This data is published and accessible in the Google Fonts BigQuery database. To learn more about the information Google collects and how it is used and secured, see Google’s Privacy Policy.
Comments
If visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.
An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here: https://automattic.com/privacy/. After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.
Media
If you upload images to the website, you should avoid uploading images with embedded location data (EXIF GPS) included. Visitors to the website can download and extract any location data from images on the website.

If you have an account and you log in to this site, we will set a temporary cookie to determine if your browser accepts cookies. This cookie contains no personal data and is discarded when you close your browser.
