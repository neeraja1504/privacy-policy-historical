Privacy Policy | HL7 International
Overall Policy
HL7 is committed to respecting the privacy of its members and visitors, and this policy has been created to protect your privacy online, provide transparency into how and why we use your data, and to keep your data safe. With regard to personal data HL7 strives to ensure:
That we have legitimate grounds for collecting and using personal data;
That we do not use the data in ways that may have unjustified adverse effects on the individuals concerned;
That we are transparent about how we intend to use the data and give individuals appropriate privacy notices when collecting their personal data.
Notice and Disclosure
HL7 uses information collected online to keep its members and visitors aware of HL7 activities and events. We ask interested parties to furnish their contact information so we can share free information such as newsletters, conference or seminar details, publications and membership information. HL7’s bylaws require that notice of a ballot be communicated to members, and HL7 notifies members of such events primarily by email.
Information Collected
Personally identifiable information is information that identifies you as an individual, such as your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, credit card information and password. We may collect personally Identifiable Information from you when you make a purchase, register to become a member, respond to an HL7 survey, voluntarily provide it when you use one of our sites or communicate with us, or voluntarily join a mail list server or chat system to contribute or request information on an HL7-related topic.
In all cases, HL7 will only collect information in accordance with legitimate interests. We collect personal data from individuals in the course of their participation in HL7 activities and events and will only use it in a manner that is consistent with their expectation as HL7 members, participants or stakeholders.
In the course of participating at HL7, members or external parties may post comments, feedback and enhancement requests related to HL7 standards or activities. HL7 is an ANSI-accredited standards development organization, and the maintenance of records related to HL7 ballots is a necessary element of ANSI compliance. Thus individuals participating in ballot activities should use caution when submitting comments, since maintaining an accurate and auditable record of all such actions is a necessary element for ANSI compliance, and may not be retractable.
Choice/Consent
HL7 does not make any personally identifiable information available to any unrelated third parties. However, HL7 members, as well as online registrants, do receive information from HL7 about activities that HL7 is involved with, as a benefit of their participation.
