We also rely on European Commission adequacy decisions about certain countries, as applicable, for data transfers to countries outside the EEA.
Our goal is to give you simple and meaningful choices regarding your information. If you have a hybridtechcar.com account, many of the choices you have on hybridtechcar.com are built directly into hybridtechcar.com or your settings. For example, you can:
Edit information in your profile at any time, decide whether your profile is available to search engines, or choose whether others can find your hybridtechcar.com account using your email address.
Link or unlink your hybridtechcar.com account from other services (like Facebook, Google or Twitter). For some services (like Facebook), you can also decide whether or not to publish your hybridtechcar.com activity to that service.
Create or be added to a secret board. Secret boards are visible to you and other collaborators in the board, and any collaborator may choose to make the board available to anyone else. For example, another collaborator can invite someone else to the board, make the board available to an app they use to view hybridtechcar.com, or even just take an image from the board and email it to their friends. For more information about secret boards, please visit our Help Center.
