Except as described in this section, we will not disclose your personal information to any third party without notifying you of our intent to share the information and giving you an opportunity to prevent your information from being shared. From time to time, we may partner with companies based on the interests of our users. These partner companies will never see your email address or any other information that could identify you or be used to contact you directly. Any exceptions to this policy of sharing your name, address or email address with a partner company will be done only with your permission. Kickdrum reserves the right to disclose information when required by law. We occasionally use other companies to perform services necessary to our operations. In the course of providing these services, those companies may have access to your personal information. By contractual agreement, those companies must treat your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. However, we will not be liable for any damages that may result from the misuse of your personal information by these companies. Kickdrum may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with Kickdrum’s server and to administer Kickdrum’s web site. Your IP address may also be used to help identify you and your online profile and to gather broad demographic information. The Kickdrum site registration form requires users to give Kickdrum contact information (such as your name and email address) and demographic information (such as your zip code, age, or income level). Kickdrum uses your contact information from the registration form to send you information about Kickdrum and promotional material from some of Kickdrum’s partners.
