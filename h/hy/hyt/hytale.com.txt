Information Hypixel Collects
Hypixel may collect information about the Services you use and how you use them, such as the selections you make on our Services. We may collect PII and DII (as defined below) when you use the Services.
Personally identifiable information (“PII”) is information that can be used to identify or contact you online or offline, such as your name, address, email, phone number, photos or audio data, and payment information. The Services may collect PII only when it is provided to Hypixel and at no other time. Specifically, if you submit an email with your name and email address or if you fill out a contact form, Hypixel collects such information. At the present time, and in no other way, other than the ways just described, does Hypixel collect your PII.
Hypixel may also create or collect device-identifiable information (“DII”), such as cookies, unique device identifiers, and similar identifiers that are linkable to a browser or device. From these platforms, we may also receive other information, such as your IP address, user agent, timestamps, precise and imprecise geolocation, sensor data, apps, fonts, battery life information, and screen size.

How Hypixel Uses the Information Collected
Hypixel uses the information we collect from our Services to provide, maintain, protect, and improve our Services, to develop new Services and offerings, and to protect us and our users.
PII is primarily used for business purposes, such as for sending you correspondence. When you contact Hypixel, Hypixel may keep a record of your communication as well as the other information associated with this correspondence in our database. The database is located on a server managed by Hypixel and no other party has access to this PII. Hypixel may use your email address to inform you about our Services, such as letting you know about changes or improvements and responding to your inquiries. Hypixel may share your PII with third-party services to send out correspondence such as MailChimp but does not share it with any other third-party.
Hypixel uses DII to operate Services and manage user sessions, including analyzing usage of our Services, preventing malicious behavioral and fraud, improving the content, to link your identity across devices and browsers in order to provide you with a more seamless experience online, and helping third parties provide relevant advertising and related metrics. We share DII with Google primarily for advertising and analytics purposes, for external processing, and for security purposes.
