When you visit this or any Web site, information is available to the site on the pages you view, the time of your visit, the browser you are using, the address of the computer you visit from, and the address of the page you are coming from. We use this information internally only, to better understand user needs and preferences and make the Hymnary more useful.

Notification of Changes
This policy may be revised over time as new features are added to Hymnary or as we incorporate suggestions from our users. The Hymnary is not responsible for notifying users of changes to this policy.
We will post the amended Privacy Policy promptly on our Web site so that you can always review what information we gather, how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose it to anyone.
