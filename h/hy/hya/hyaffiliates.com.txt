For the purposes of this policy, personal data shall mean any information relating to you which identifies or may identify you and which includes, for example, your name, address and identification number.
The present Privacy Policy aims to help you better understand the most recent changes to the Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy and how they may impact you. To fully understand the changes and terms that will govern your use of our “Services,” you will need to read the full Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy.
This Privacy Policy applies to the processing activities performed by HYCM to the personal data of its clients and its potential clients, website visitors and employees. This Privacy Policy does not apply to websites operated by any other organisations or other third parties.
Please note that if you are an employee of the Company, a contractor to the Company or a third-party service provider, your personal information will be used in connection with your employment contract or your contractual relationship, whichever applies.
We may process your personal data on the following bases and for the following purposes:
Performance of a contract
We process personal data in order to provide our services and products, as well as information regarding our products and services based on the contractual relationship with our clients (i.e. so as to perform our contractual obligations). In addition, processing of personal data takes place to be able to complete our client on-boarding/acceptance procedures.
In view of the above, we need to verify your identity in order to accept you as our client and we will need to use those details in order to effectively manage your trading account with us. This may include third parties carrying out sanctions checks on our behalf. The use of your personal information is necessary for us to know who you are as we have a legal obligation to comply with ‘Know Your Customer’ and 'Customer Due Diligence’ regulatory obligations.
Compliance with a legal obligation
There are a number of legal obligations imposed by relevant laws to which we are subject, as well as specific statutory requirements (e.g. anti-money laundering laws, financial services laws, corporation laws, privacy laws and tax laws). There are also various supervisory authorities whose laws and regulations apply to us. Such obligations and requirements impose on us necessary personal data processing activities for credit checks, identity verification, payment processing, compliance with court orders, tax law or other reporting obligations and anti-money laundering controls.
These obligations apply at various times, including client on-boarding/acceptance, payments and systemic checks for risk management.
For the purposes of safeguarding legitimate interests
We process personal data so as to safeguard the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party. A legitimate interest is when we have a business or commercial reason to use your information. Despite that, it must not unfairly go against what is right and best for you. Examples of such processing activities include the following:
initiating legal claims and preparing our defense in litigation procedures;
means and processes we undertake to provide for the Company’s IT and system security, preventing potential crime, asset security, admittance controls and anti-trespassing measures;
setting up CCTV systems (e.g. at our premises for security reasons);
measures to manage business and for further developing products and services;
sharing your personal data within the HYCM Group for the purpose of updating/verifying your personal data in accordance with the relevant anti-money laundering compliance framework;
risk management
For Identity Verification purposes
The Company needs to perform its due diligence measures and apply the principles of KYC (Know-Your-Client) before entering a client relationship in order to prevent actions, such as money laundering or terrorist financing, and also to perform other duties imposed by law. Therefore, we collect from our clients’ identity verification information (such as images of your government issued national ID card or International Passport, or driving licence or other governmental proof of identification, as permitted by applicable laws) or other authentication information. We are also requesting our clients to provide us with a recent Utility Bill in order to verify their address. Further to this, the Company can use third parties which carry out identity checks on its behalf.
You have provided your consent
Our storage and use of your personal data is based on your consent (other than for the reasons described or implied in this policy when your consent is not required). You may revoke consent at any time; however, any processing of personal data prior to the receipt of your revocation will not be affected.
