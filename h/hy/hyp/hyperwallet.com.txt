(which, together with their respective parents, subsidiaries and affiliates, are collectively known as “Hyperwallet”, and referred to herein as “We” or “Us”) on behalf of your payor (“Payor”).
By registering for your Pay Portal and accepting the terms of the Pay Portal and Services (the “Terms of Service”), you expressly consent to our use and disclosure of your personal information and direct us to do so in the manner described in this Privacy Policy.
1. Collection of Personally Identifiable Information
Information about you is collected directly from you through the Pay Portal and may also be provided directly by the Payor. This information may include your name, home address, telephone number, personal e-mail address, your forwarding address (e.g. during a vacation), previous address(es), billing and account information (such as credit card, or bank account number), your mailing preferences, delivery instructions, transaction history, and service preferences as well as other information defined as non-public or private information about you pursuant to applicable law. In addition, from time to time, via the Pay Portal or otherwise, you may be asked to provide more detailed information regarding your interests, occupation and background. For example, sometimes users of the Pay Portal may be asked to complete surveys in order to get a better sense of who they are and what issues, products or services may be of interest to such users.

We may use and disclose the resulting “de-identified” information without restrictions. For example, we may create de-identified, statistical, and aggregate data to prepare reports about the Pay Portal that do not identify any individual users.
