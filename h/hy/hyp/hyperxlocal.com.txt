Use of Cookies
Cookies are small bits of information that a Web site transfers to your computer’s hard drive for record-keeping purposes.

The use of cookies is an industry-wide practice and you’ll find them at most major Web sites. By “looking” for a cookie, our server can determine whether you have already registered as a Member of our site. As a result, if you are a Member, you may see a customized front page and will not need to re-register each time you log on. Cookies also help us to serve you better by improving the site. They allow HXL to track your interests and add content that is more relevant to you. Most Web browsers are usually set to initially accept cookies. If you prefer, you can set your browser to refuse cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, the site may not function properly if you do not accept cookies.
