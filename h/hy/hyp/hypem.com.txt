What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?
This Privacy Policy covers Hype Machine's treatment of personal information that Hype Machine gathers when you are on the Site and when you use Hype Machine's services (the "Services"). This policy also covers Hype Machine's treatment of any personal information that Hype Machine's business partners share with Hype Machine.
This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that Hype Machine does not own or control, or to individuals that Hype Machine does not employ or manage.
What Personal Information About Customers Does Hype Machine Collect?
Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you with a friendly, customized, and efficient experience. We collect the following types of information from our users:
a. Information You Provide to Us
We receive and store any information you enter on the Site or provide to us in any other way. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our Site's features. The personal information you provide is used for such purposes as responding to your requests for certain services, customizing the content you see, and communicating with you about surveys, new products and services. In order for you to use our Site, you are not required to register; however, you must register to take advantage of certain features of the Site, such as bookmarking favorites and other information to appear on your dashboard and receiving e-mail newsletters from us. To register, you must provide your e-mail address, a username and a password. If you wish to become a subscriber, or purchase merchandise from our Site, you must disclose certain billing and shipping information to our third-party service providers (such as Big Cartel, Stripe or PayPal), including your name, address and information about your method of payment.
b. Automatic Information
We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. Hype Machine automatically receives and records certain "traffic data" on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, Hype Machine cookie information, and the page you requested. Hype Machine uses this traffic data to help diagnose problems with its servers, analyze trends and administer the Site.
Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Site and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show. This data is only used in the aggregate. This type of collective data enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the Site, so we can make the Site appealing to as many users as possible. In addition, we may provide statistical information, not information about you personally, to our partners about how our users, collectively, use our Site. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use their areas and our Site, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal web experience.
c. E-mail Communications
In certain cases, we may receive a confirmation when you open an e-mail from Hype Machine in order to help us make e-mails more interesting and helpful. We also send out e-mail newsletters with new music or information about product updates to users who have opted in. If you do not want to receive e-mail from us, you can use the unsubscribe link at the bottom of every message. Please contact us at privacy@hypem.com if you have further questions.
d. Information From Other Sources
For purposes such as improving personalization of our service, we may receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information (for instance, if you link your Hype Machine account to your SoundCloud or Spotify accounts). We do not share this information unless it is essential to provide the service (for example, storing and sending an authentication token to Spotify, to keep your favorites synced). We may also receive delivery and address information from our shippers or other sources to facilitate delivery of your membership rewards or purchases.
