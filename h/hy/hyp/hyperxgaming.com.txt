Privacy Statement | Kingston
General
Except for the circumstances which we later explain in the following paragraph, we do not collect PII, except when you specifically and knowingly disclose such information. This information is generally collected when you order our products or services, register your products on the website, provide information on a website, web property, or web-based function directly created by or controlled by Kingston, or through any Kingston presence on a social media platform, fill in surveys, take part in promotional events (including competitions), correspond with us, discuss a service issue on the phone with an associate, sign up to receive Kingston product and service updates whether with Kingston or an agent of Kingston, or when we meet with you at meetings or events. If you disclose your PII, we will only store and use such information that we need to meet your requests and our legitimate interests and business objectives, including, where you have consented, providing you with information about products and services that we consider may be of interest to you. We primarily use your PII to perform our contractual obligations to you and fulfil our legal obligations, to run our business efficiently and provide you with an improved and customized online experience and service.
If you have already consented to receiving information about our products and/or services and have viewed the Website after following a link in an email you have received from us, then we may use a targeting cookie to help us better understand which of our products and/or services interest you. This targeting cookie only collects data about which products and/or services you have shown a particular interest in. That data concerning your interest in our products and/or services is sent to a third party who notes it against the existing record of your consent to receive marketing communications from us.
Product Purchases
When purchasing through the website, we employ a registration process which requires that you provide us with your first and last name, billing and shipping information (which includes your home or other physical address, the name of your city or town, your telephone number, your e-mail address or other PII). We use this information to perform our contract to supply you with our products. If you choose not to provide your PII at the point of collection, you will not be able to purchase products through the website.
Product Registration
When you register, we may ask for your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, type of product, serial number and date of purchase or other product-identifying information. We use this information to fulfil our contractual and legal obligations including providing you with support and information and our legitimate interests of managing our relationship with you. If you choose not to provide this information, you will not be able to register products on the website; however, you may continue to use the products.
Personal Contact Information
We use your contact information to complete and support your purchases from us, to facilitate and improve your use of the website, to communicate with you (including, if you have consented, sending marketing communications) and to comply with any requirements of law. We also use this information to respond to any questions you might have and, if you have consented, to provide you with information about special deals offered through the website. Your personal contact information may be disclosed to our staff and to third parties involved in the completion of your transaction, the delivery of your order or the support of your use of the website.
Credit Card Information
When you order any product through our website or at a Tradeshow or request an RMA (Returned Merchandise Authorization) on our website, you may be redirected to a third-party payment gateway service to provide your credit card information including the credit card number, card security code (also called CVV2, CVC2, CID code), the expiration date and the billing address. This information is used to perform our contract to supply you with our products or services and for our legitimate interest of collecting payments which may be due to us. The third-party payment gateway service is fully compliant with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) for payment processing.
Online Surveys
In order to improve our products and services, we may use your PII (including your identity, contact details, and usage data) to send you online surveys. These surveys help our legitimate interest of learning more about your experience with our products and services. Your responses to these surveys are treated as confidential information. If you do not wish to participate in a survey, you may simply decline when asked.
Product Updates and Promotional E-mails
We regularly send product updates and promotional e-mails as a service to our existing customers, and to individuals who have registered or consented to receive such updates and emails. We will use your PII (including your identity and contact details) to send you newsletters and e-mails periodically listing current specials, promotions and deals only if you elect to receive these e-mails. If you have elected to receive these e-mails and wish to discontinue receiving them in the future, please follow the opt-out instructions provided on the e-mails or log into your account on the website and follow the instructions to make the appropriate changes.
Correspondence
If you contact us with feedback, comments, questions or for any other reason, we may keep records of that correspondence and collect your PII for the legitimate purpose of processing your inquiries, responding to your requests and improving our services.
