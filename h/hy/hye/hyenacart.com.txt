Privacy Policy :: Hyena Cart
This privacy policy exists to let you know what information you provide to Hyena Cart is collected, and how this information is used and shared. Privacy is very important to us at Hyena Cart and you should know up-front that none of your information will be shared with third-parties, nor will you receive unsolicited email from Hyena Cart as a result of account registration.
Please review this policy frequently as it may change in the future.
Account Registration
At the time of account registration, your first name and email address will be collected and stored. Your first name is used in greeting messages throughout the site to make you feel welcome. Your name and email address are provided to sellers from whom you place orders so that they can communicate with you and ensure a satisfactorily completed transaction.
Upon registration, an activation email will be sent to you to confirm your email address. In addition, you may request password resets which will be sent to you via email.
Registration to the Hyena Cart Forums includes optional information such as url, and alternate contact methods. This information is purely voluntary and can be shared by you at will. The forum software will also send notification emails of private messages and post notifications if you choose to receive them.
Orders
When you complete a transaction through a Hyena Cart store, if it is completed via Paypal, your full name and address will be stored within the Hyena Cart database as a reference to the seller. This information is available only to the seller with whom the transaction was completed and will not be shared with anyone else.
Polls and Surveys
Occasionally, polls or surveys may be conducted to determine and prioritize needed Hyena Cart features. These polls will be conducted on-line, with no email, and the individual results will be kept strictly confidential. Statistical and aggregate information from these polls will be shared in a non-personally identifiable manner.
Communications from the Site
Aside from the aforementioned registration confirmation emails, passwords resets, and forum notifications, the only email that will be sent to you by Hyena Cart are purchase and payment notifications during transactions. Hyena Cart will not send promotional, service-related or information emails of any kind. If you wish to stay abreast of the latest Hyena Cart news, you may request email notification from the HC Blog. You can also request to be removed from this mailing list at any time.
