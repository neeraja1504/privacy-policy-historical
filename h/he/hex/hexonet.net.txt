5. Piwik
Website Tracking Hexonet respects the privacy of its Users. Hence, its websites use Piwik for analysing web traffic and statistical purposes. Piwik is open source software, which allows companies to review the code and functionality of the software against privacy concerns. Therefore, by using Piwik, Hexonet alone keeps control of the data of our Users. This data is stored on Hexonet's own MySQL database.  Logs and report data will never be sent to other servers by the Piwik software (see also Piwik's Privacy Policy: https://piwik.org/privacy/).  Piwik uses “cookies”( for information on Cookies see: Cookie Policy) to help the website analyze how a User uses a website. Hexonet Users will have cookies stored on the devices that they use to access a Hexonet website. The information generated by a cookie about a User's use of a website, including their IP address, is anonymized prior to its storage. Users may refuse this use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on their browser.   Hexonet will not associate the website data of a User with the personal data of a User stored for other purposes.

This data includes the Registrants' full name, mailing address, phone number, email address, and where provided the facsimile number and in addition the creation and expiration date of the respective domain name registration and the name server information associated with a Registrant's domain name. Hexonet is obliged by ICANN to make this information available to the public via a "port 43" WHOIS and an interactive webpage. Once this information is made public, Hexonet has no influence on its use by third parties.
7.  Disclosure
Hexonet will only disclose personal information as stated by this policy.
a. Hexonet disclaims any intention to censor, edit, or engage in ongoing review or surveillance of communications stored on or transmitted through its facilities by Users or others.

d. Hexonet may also disclose contact information with the permission of a User when gathering and posting testimonials.

Hexonet may provide information to regulatory authorities and law enforcement officials in accordance with applicable laws or where Hexonet has a good faith belief that the law requires such disclosure.

IV. Security
1.Transport Layer Security (TSL)
Hexonet has security measures in place to help prevent the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under its control. When a User places an order online, their information, including their credit card number, is protected using TSL encryption technology. This encrypts order data and is designed to aid in ensuring the accuracy and security of User information.
2.Two-Factor-Authentication (2FA)
2FA is a technology that improves the security of account access by employing two methods to identify a User as the legitimate account holder. The 2FA login process differs from the standard login in the Control Panel, if a User decides to enable 2FA (https://cp.hexonet.net/cp2/downloads/2FA.pdf).
nbsp;
V. After Termination
After termination of the business relationship, Hexonet will store personal information only in order to comply with its legal obligations, to resolve disputes or in cases where it needs to enforce its agreements.
VI. Policy Amendments
Hexonet may modify this Privacy Policy from time to time. In that case it will notify Users through its service and/or by other means, such as via E-Mail, in order to give Users the opportunity to review those changes before they continue to use Hexonet’s Services. The continued use of the website by a User following any changes to this Policy will be deemed to constitute their consent to such changes. The operative and effective version of this Policy will be the latest version available on the website.
VII. Final Note
Users can access their personal information, such as the address and contact information, at any time to correct, delete or amend any of the data shared with Hexonet. Access of personal User information is available by clicking on the “Customer Login” link at the top any Hexonet Website homepage. The account information is secure and is accessible by the password defined by the User or if the User has enabled Two-Factor-Authorization, a User defined password and auto-generated code by a Two-Factor-Authorization application.
