Such information may be hosted on our Cloud system provider and accessed by Hexagram on a business need to know basis.

When you access our website, cookies will be created.
Cookies are pieces of data created when you visit a site, and contain a unique, anonymous number. They are stored in the cookie directory of your hard drive, and do not expire at the end of your session.
We use two types of cookie- session detail cookies (which are used for session recognition during a session) which we store in browser local storage, and Device ID cookies (which expire after 30 days). Cookies do not contain any personal information about you and cannot be used to identify an individual user. If you choose not to accept the cookie, this will not affect your access to the majority of facilities available on our websites.
Although your browser may be set up to allow the creation of cookies, you can specify that you be prompted before a site puts a cookie on your hard disk, so that you can decide whether to allow or disallow the cookie. You can also opt-out of cookie storage via our domain found at pubocean.com. Alternatively, you can set your computer not to accept any cookie.
Log files are also created when persons visit our website. They allow us to record visitors’ use of the websites and include your IP address. We may put together log file information from all our visitors, which we use to make improvements to the content and layout of the websites and to the information in it, based on the way that visitors move around it. We also use your IP address for geographic analysis (IP2Geo mapping). This can identify your IP geographical address based on your city used to access our website. However, your individual address cannot be deduced by the IP address alone.
Your IP address is recorded automatically when you access our website to assist us in monitoring and improving content and for security reasons. You are, therefore, obligated to provide this when accessing the website. Once you have provided your IP address and we have completed our geographic analysis, we amend the last octet of your IP address so it is set to zero. As such, we do not store your full IP address.
