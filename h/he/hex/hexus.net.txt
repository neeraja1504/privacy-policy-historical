If you provide your opt-in consent to receiving marketing information from any of our “Publications”, We will then process your email address accordingly, allowing us to send you marketing information about our “Publications’” content, products and information on its clients; this may be done using the following means, but not exclusive to competitions and newsletters. The legal ground for processing your email address for this purpose is your consent. You may withdraw your consent at any time by changing your preferences in your “Publication”-based account or through the unsubscribe link at the bottom of our marketing emails. The marketing emails you receive from our “Publications” are based on the preferences you provide in your account. The legal ground for processing this data for this purpose is of our “Publications” legitimate interest in reducing the number of marketing emails sent to each particular customer by selecting which customers receive a particular marketing email rather than sending every marketing email to every customer who has consented to receiving marketing emails.

Personal data is processed when you sign in to your “Publication”-specific user account with Social Media Credentials if you choose them:
You may choose to sign in to your account using your social media sign in credentials (e.g., your Facebook sign-in credentials).

All this information is made available to us by the social media provider due to the way the social sign-in configuration works. However, the only information that we retain and process is your email address. If you do not want your information to be shared within our group of “Publications” by the social media provider, then you can simply sign in to your account using your account credentials instead of your social media account credentials.
Our “Publications” associate the email address provided by the social media provider with your account so that you can use your email address (and/or Username) to sign in to your account in the future if you no longer wish to sign in using your social media account credentials.
