When we transfer Personal Information to third party agents, we will comply with the Privacy Shield notice principle, ascertain that the third party agent is obligated to provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the Privacy Shield principles, and enter into a contract with the third party agent that provides that: (1) the third party agent will process the Personal Information only for limited and specified purposes, (2) the third party agent will provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the Privacy Shield principles; (3) Hexcel will take reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure that the third party agent effectively processes the Personal Information pursuant to the Privacy Shield privacy principles; (4) the third party agent will notify us if the third party agent can no longer provide the same level of privacy protection as required by the Privacy Shield principles; and, (5) upon such notice by the third party agent, we will take steps to stop and remediate any unauthorized processing.
