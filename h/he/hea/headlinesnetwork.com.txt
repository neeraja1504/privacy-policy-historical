Privacy Policy – YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS
Effective Date: November 2016 (Last updated: February 2017)
This Privacy Policy applies to our web and mobile services where it appears.
This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use and disclose information that we collect about users through the web and mobile services where it appears (collectively, the “Services”).
We collect information about you.
Automated information.   We collect personal information about users over time and across different websites when you use the Services.  We also have third party vendors that collect information this way.  We collect statistical information about how users use the Services.  Using technologies such as cookies, web beacons and similar technologies, we may automatically collect information about your computer, mobile devices, and online activity when you access the Services, including information about your browsing history. If you use our Services, we may collect information about the browser you’re using. We might look at what site you came from, or what site you visit when you leave us.  Learn more about these tools and how you can control them, here (or by visiting http://headlinesnetwork.com/ads ).
Information from other sources.   We may combine the information that we collect with information that we obtain from other sources, such as third party service providers.  We may combine information we get from you with information about you we get from third parties.
How we use your information.
We use information to improve our products and services. We might use your information to customize your experience with us.  We may use your information for research on our users’ demographics, interests, and behavior to help us operate the Services or for other business purposes.  We may use your information to serve you with advertising content in which we think you’ll be interested.
We use information to look at site trends and customer interests. We may use your information to make our website and products better. We may use your information to customize your experience with us.
We use information for security purposes. We may use information to protect our company, our customers, or our Services.
We use information for marketing purposes. For example, we might send you information about special promotions or offers. We might tell you about new features or products. These might be our own offers or products, or third party offers or products we think you might find interesting.
We use information as otherwise permitted by law or as we may notify you. For example, we may use your IP address for identification purposes in cooperation with internet service providers or law enforcement agencies.
We may share information with third parties.
**We will share information with our corporate affiliates.   **
We will share information with third parties who perform services on our behalf.  We may share your information with authorized service providers that help us provide the Services or perform other business functions for us.
We will share information with our business partners. For example, we will share information with third party media companies and publishers we partner with to provide the Services. These partners may use your information for their marketing purposes. For example, these partners may serve you with advertising content based on your interests.
We will share information if we think we have to in order to comply with the law or to protect ourselves. For example, we will share information at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation, or to verify or enforce compliance with our internal policies and applicable laws. We will share information to respond to a court order or subpoena. Or, we might share information when we are investigating potential fraud. We may share your information whenever we believe disclosure is necessary to limit our liability or to protect or enforce the rights, interests or safety of our products and services, our users or others.
We may share information with any successor to all or part of our business. For example, if part of our business is sold we may give our customer list as part of that transaction.
We may share information in an aggregated or other non-personally identifiable form.
We may share information as otherwise described to you at the point of collection.
