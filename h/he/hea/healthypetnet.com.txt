Life's Abundance Privacy Policy
Life's Abundance has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to your privacy. The following discloses our information-gathering and dissemination practices for Life's Abundance.
Your credit card is safe with Life's Abundance.
Every time you shop with Life's Abundance, your purchase is backed by a security guarantee. Our secure server encrypts (or scrambles) all of your personal information, including your name, address, credit card number, log-in name and password. Our encryption measures ensure that no one can access or use your personal information. Our encryption is implemented with a secure certificate.
We guarantee your privacy
At Life's Abundance, we are committed to protecting your privacy. Life's Abundance does not trade, sell or rent your personal information to other companies. It may be helpful for you to know how we use the information we collect:
We collect and aggregate non-personally identifiable information about shoppers browsing our site. We collect information such as your IP address, web browser type and operating system to enable us to provide shoppers with an enhanced shopping experience.
Customers
Our ordering process requires you to give us contact information (like name, address, email and phone number), which we use to ship product orders and to contact you if necessary. As a direct sales company, our organization is based upon a network of our Independent Distributors, who own their own websites. Therefore, customers who register with us and do not have a Distributor will be assigned one. Life's Abundance will pass along the customer's contact information (Name, mailing address, phone number and email) and order information (item, quantity and price) to their assigned Distributor. Life's Abundance does NOT pass any financial information along to the Distributor.
What Information is being shared?
We may need to share information with other companies during the course of business. For example, companies like UPS. We need to share your name and address with UPS to ship your order to you. However, these companies do not have any independent right to use this information for any secondary purposes.
Email

We may file your comments to help us make future improvements to our web site, or we may review and discard the information contained in your email.
