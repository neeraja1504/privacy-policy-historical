Cookies.
We make limited use of "cookies," which are small sets of text information stored onto your computer in connection with your use of our website. We use cookies to store temporary individual user information concerning your use of this site and your user identification. We do not use cookies to collect or store personally identifiable information. Our site can't read other data on your hard drive or read cookies created by other sites. Some of our business partners may use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies.
Other Web Sites.
Our site includes links to other web sites whose privacy practices may differ from those of Healthbase. If you submit your information to any of those sites, your information is subject to their privacy statements. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy statement of any web site you visit. If you use a link from Healthbase's site to another site, or if you arrived at Healthbase through a link from another site, it is also possible that these other sites may place a cookie or other identifier on your computer. We do not control and are not responsible for the use of cookies, policies, practices or content of anyone except Healthbase.
Security.
We take precautions to protect your information. Wherever we collect sensitive information such as your personal data, that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption for transmitting personal information. You can verify this by looking for a "https" at the beginning of the address of the web page, or by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web browser. Just like we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job, for example, customer service are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers n which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment. We routinely monitor and upgrade our security systems to ensure that we use the best security technology available.
Listed below are some of the security procedures that Healthbase uses to protect your privacy:
Requires both a personal username and a password in order for users to access their personal information.
Utilizes Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption in transmitting personal information to our servers. In order to take advantage of encryption technology, you must have an Internet browser which supports 128-bit encryption.
Requires all Healthbase employees to abide by our Privacy Policy.
Limits access to personal information to authorized users only.
Healthbase enables you to have full control over who has access to your personal information.
We use efforts consistent with sound industry practice, such as firewalls and SSL encryption, to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal identifying information. Given the nature of the Internet, we cannot ensure complete security and we are not responsible for any breach of security or for the actions of any person or entity other than Healthbase. In addition, Healthbase cooperates with law enforcement inquiries, we obey court orders, and we honor subpoenas and other legal process. Your personal identifying information may be disclosed if we are compelled by law or legal process to disclose it. We may also disclose such information if we determine in our sole discretion that disclosure would be useful in connection with investigating possible non-compliance either with the law or with any Healthbase policy including this Privacy Policy. Although we take precautions against security breaches, hackers pose a threat to any Internet user, and the legal and regulatory status of matters on the Internet is uncertain both in the United States and abroad. For these reasons, we cannot guarantee that all of your private communications and other personal identifying information will never be disclosed in ways you do not expect or which are not described in this Privacy Policy. We will make commercially reasonable efforts to see that your information is treated in compliance with this Privacy Policy.
Changes in Healthbase Policy and Website Maintenance.
As our business grows or changes, and as technology and Internet use and practices change, Healthbase may from time to time change its policies, potentially including this Privacy Policy. If any such changes are made, they will be posted on this website. Therefore we encourage you to review our Privacy Policy and other policies posted on this site for potential changes when you return to the site for future visits or to transact business.
Healthbase accepts no responsibility for the loss or additional expense caused to the users by any acts of God, dangers, incidental to the sea, fire, breakdown, or equipment, adverse weather, acts of government, or other authorities, wars, whether declared or not, hostilities, civil disturbances, political instability or unrest, strikes, labor disputes, riots, thefts, pilferage, epidemics, quarantine, customs regulations, delays, changes in itinerary or schedules, by any other cause, condition or event whatsoever beyond the control of Healthbase.
