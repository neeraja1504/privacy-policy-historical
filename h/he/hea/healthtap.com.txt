Privacy Statement - HealthTap
In this Privacy Statement, “we” refers to HealthTap, Inc
What is this document?
This Privacy Statement describes what personally identifiable information you can share with us on this website (the “Site”) or our other mobile and related services (e.g., your date of birth or some aspect of your medical condition), how that information is stored, how we use that information, and what information other members and doctors can see when they use HealthTap and HealthTap Prime.
For a description of our services (including HealthTap and HealthTap Prime), please read our Terms of Use
For the purpose of this Privacy Statement, “Personally Identifiable Information” means any information that, by itself or in combination with other information, identifies or can reasonably be used to identify an individual, such as their name, email address, telephone number, address, or date of birth. Personally Identifiable Information does not include information that is anonymized, or publicly available information that has not been combined with non-public Personally Identifiable Information.
Why should I read this Privacy Statement?
When you sign up for or use HealthTap, we ask you to confirm that you've read and agree to our Privacy Statement. This means that by submitting Personally Identifiable Information and other information to the Site, you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of such information as set out in this Privacy Statement.
What information do we collect?
Generally, you may browse the Site and/or our applications without providing any Personally Identifiable Information. However, we ask that you provide information at various times and locations through the Site.
This section sets out what Personally Identifiable Information we may collect from you when you use our services:
Information you store on your Profile
We collect information you provide when you create a HealthTap account, including your name, email address, and date of birth. You can add optional health information to your HealthTap Profile (“Profile”), for example personal information, health goals, medications, conditions, and other information, which helps to personalize your HealthTap experience. You choose what health information to add to your Profile when using HealthTap and adding information into your Profile.
Information provided on HealthTap Premium Services
If you decide to sign up for HealthTap Premium Services, including Prime and Concierge, we ask you to provide additional information, including payment information. For more information on HealthTap Premium Services, please consult our Terms of Use
Information provided in Virtual Consults
At the end of every successfully-completed virtual consult (meaning a consultation between a doctor and a patient through a HealthTap service using a video link), the doctor with whom you have had your virtual consult will prepare a brief doctor’s note about the virtual consult (the “Consult Summary”). These Consult Summaries become part of your Profile. When you initiate Virtual Consults on HealthTap, the doctor you see will be able to view all of the Consult Summaries on HealthTap.
Why do we ask you for certain types of information?
Health conditions and appropriate actions often depend on your age group, geography, and gender. This data helps us to provide you with a personalized online health experience. Your Personally Identifiable Information is not visible to other members or doctors on HealthTap. This data is only visible to doctors you connect with using HealthTap Premium Services (including Prime and Concierge).
How do we use your information?
We will use your Personally Identifiable Information only for the purpose for which it was provided, as well as other purposes for which you have given consent. This includes, but is not limited to, the following purposes:
Administration of your Profile: We use your profile information and your health and wellness goals to help you better understand, stay engaged with, and track your health and to present you with personalized, relevant information. Your email address is used to create, log into, and manage your account on HealthTap.

Marketing: You may subscribe or unsubscribe to receive marketing communications from us, such as announcements of new features. Please note that we have a strict “No-Spam” policy. We do not share email addresses or other contact information with third parties without your permission.
Notifications: We will ask you if you want to receive notifications when you open an account with HealthTap. If you agree, HealthTap may send you email, SMS, or mobile push notices, providing you with account-related reminders or updates, or letting you know that you have a message on HealthTap.
We also may use your Personally Identifiable Information to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, as required and/or allowed by applicable privacy laws.
Automated decision making and profiling
We use any relevant information in your health profile to generate better answers to your health questions. For example, we use the information you provide about your medical condition to better triage your symptoms. Your experience on the site and/or our applications is tailored to you based on the profile information you provide. The information you provide is not used for advertising.
Disclosing Personally Identifiable Information to Third Parties
Any Personally Identifiable Information that you provide to us will be used for our purposes only. We do not share Personally Identifiable Information with other individuals or other companies other than as described in this Privacy Statement.

In some instances we may retain other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf, including, but not limited to, website developers, IT services providers, shipping or direct mail organizations, storage facilities, or parties assisting us in a recruitment process.
Such third parties may be provided with access to your Personally Identifiable Information to perform the functions for which they have been retained. Our agreements with these third parties will not permit them to use your Personally Identifiable Information for any other purposes and commit them to comply with applicable data privacy standards.
We further may disclose any information, including Personally Identifiable Information, we deem necessary, in our sole discretion, to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request.

Also, the questions you may enter on HealthTap are anonymous. Only the questions, not your identity, are publicly visible.

Your personal contact information is never visible on HealthTap to other members or doctors.
