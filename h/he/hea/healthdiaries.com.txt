Privacy Policy for HealthDiaries.com
Health Diaries understands the sensitive nature of the topics on this site. Privacy is as important to us as it is to you. When agreeing to keep a diary or blog on Health Diaries, the only personally identifying information we request is a valid email address so that we may contact you with further details about how to set up your diary and to correspond with you about your account. We will never knowingly share or sell your e-mail to any third party.
The amount of information you decide to share in your diary is entirely up to you. We do not post anybody's personal health information on the site. Each individual decides what he or she will post in his or her individual diary. We will never share that information with any third parties. We will only post somebody's information if he or she specifically requests us to, i.e. in the event that he or she is unable to access his or her own diary for technical reasons. The diary and information contained therein belongs to the person writing the information. We simply set up, host, and organize personal diaries under a variety of health topics, with no intent to share the information in those diaries with any individual or corporation other than the visitors to the website who come to read the diaries.
If you choose to use your real name when keeping a diary, we are not responsible for any privacy issues that may arise.
THIRD PARTY LINKS When visiting Health Diaries, you may click on a link that takes you to a third-party site that is not part of HealthDiaries.com. HealthDiaries.com is not responsible for the information contained in those sites or for those sites' own privacy policies.
HealthDiaries.com reserves the right to make changes to this policy at any time. The revised policy will be posted here. Check back from time to time to check for such changes so that you will be fully informed of all privacy issues related to HealthDiaries.com.
