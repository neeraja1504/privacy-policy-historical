This document is the Heart Foundation’s Australian Privacy Principle (APP) privacy policy; it explains how the Heart Foundation approaches privacy and the management of your personal information.  Please contact the Privacy Officer in your state or territory (details below) if you require any further information regarding our Privacy Notice.
The Heart Foundation is Australia's leading heart health charity, saving lives through funding heart health research, community education programs and services to patients. The Heart Foundation is funded almost entirely by public donations and gifts from people's wills.
The Heart Foundation was established in 1959 and since then has played a leading role in decreasing the incidence of death from heart disease by almost 70%. Despite this success, heart disease remains the biggest cause of premature death in Australia today and the Heart Foundation works to help all Australians live longer healthier lives.
The Australian Privacy Principles
The Australian Government introduced new legislation, effective 12 March 2014, which further protects the privacy of individuals.  These principles replace the National Privacy Principles that came into force on 21 December 2001. You can find out more about these principles by calling the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner on 1300 36 39 92 or through their website at http://www.oaic.gov.au/
The Heart Foundation respects and upholds your right to privacy protection under the National Privacy Principles in regulating how we collect, use, disclose and hold your personal information. We have a detailed policy and set of procedures to ensure that only authorised staff have access to your personal information and that it remains confidential and is only used for appropriate purposes and in accordance with this notice.
Why we collect your personal information
Your personal and sensitive information, including health information, is only collected as is necessary for a function or activity, or to enable the Heart Foundation to carry out its work and deliver services to the community.
The Heart Foundation is very grateful to the many thousands of people around Australia who provide financial support to allow us to continue our important lifesaving work. When you give us personal information such as your name and address, we record it on our database and may use it to contact you in the future.
We may use your personal information to send you information on heart health or to let you know about our programs, research funding, special events and fundraising programs.  Each time we send you a direct marketing communication we will provide you with a simple way to ’opt out’ of receiving similar communications in the future.
You can also let us know that you do not wish to receive any further communications by contacting the Privacy Officer in your state or territory as detailed below.
The Heart Foundation will not collect sensitive information about health, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions or membership, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade association or union membership, sexual preferences or criminal record unless you have consented to give this information and it is relevant to the work of the Heart Foundation. We will always collect such information in a non-intrusive, lawful and fair manner.   We will offer you the option of not identifying yourself or of using a pseudonym where it is practical to do so.
Opting out or modifying your information
If you want to change any information that you have previously given us, or if you want to opt out of future communications please contact the Privacy Officer in your state or territory as detailed below.
How we collect your personal information
We collect your personal information when you provide it to the Heart Foundation in a number of ways including but not limited to:
through a call to our Health Information Service
by participating in one of the Heart Foundation's many community fundraising and information events
when you respond to our fundraising campaigns.
We may also collect your personal information in other ways, for example through the purchase of commercial lists, and from publicly available sources such as the telephone directory.
You may be photographed when you attend Heart Foundation events however wherever practical we would seek to obtain your consent prior to using the image obtained.
How we keep your personal information secure
If you provide us with information via a form on our website, it is stored securely in our databases and only accessed by staff authorised by the Heart Foundation. The Heart Foundation uses a range of hardware and software security measures to protect our information and ensure that only authorised staff are granted access.
Disclosing your personal information
The Heart Foundation will not provide your personal information to any other individuals or organisations without your prior consent except where required by law to do so or where that information is provided on a confidential basis to contractors who provide services to the Heart Foundation (for example database management, printing and mailing).  In these cases, we ensure that our contractors are also bound by the Australian Privacy Principles to keep your personal information confidential.
The Heart Foundation is very thankful to people who are willing to share their personal stories of heart disease with others through media stories and in our newsletters. We will only use your personal information for publicity purposes or as stories in newsletters with your express written permission.
The Heart Foundation may, from time to time, include selected messages from Heart Foundation event sponsors, collaborators or third parties however we will not provide your details to any third party for marketing purposes without your prior consent.
Transfer of information overseas would normally only occur for data processing purposes, for example third party payment facilitators may process their data off-shore.  The Heart Foundation’s payment gateway currently processes data in the USA.  The Heart Foundation will not transfer your personal information overseas or into the “cloud” unless we have taken reasonable steps to ensure that the information which is being transferred will not be held, used or disclosed by the recipient of the information in a manner which is inconsistent with the Australian Privacy Principles.
The Heart Foundation will sometimes use third party service providers to conduct surveys and facilitate information collection and event registration.  Some of these service providers conduct all or part of their business overseas and so your personal information may be transferred overseas as a result.  The Heart Foundation conducts a due diligence process before entering into an agreement with these service providers and will take all reasonable steps to ensure that your information is not used in a manner inconsistent with the Australian Privacy Principles.
