2. How we use your information
We may use information we hold about you in one or more of the following ways:
• To ensure that content from this website is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your computer, and to monitor and improve the performance of this website and the products and services available through this website.
• To customise the advertising that you see.
• To provide you with information, products or services that you request from us.
• To send you marketing and promotional materials on our behalf and on behalf of our group companies and marketing partners, where we feel these may interest you, if you have consented to be contacted for such purposes. If you do not want to receive this marketing and promotional material, you can notify us as part of the registration process, and you can always opt out of receiving any further marketing and promotional emails from us by clicking the unsubscribe link at the end of any email you receive from us in future. If you experience any problems unsubscribing, you should contact info@healthyfoodguide.co.uk
• To allow you to participate in interactive features of our services, if you choose to do so.

• For any purpose if we are required to do so by any law or other regulatory or governmental authority.
Where we have a contract with you, for example where we are providing you with specific products or services, or where you have entered a competition, we process your personal information where necessary on the lawful basis that it is necessary to enable us to fulfil our obligations under that contract.
Where we ask for your consent to use of your personal information, such as for marketing purposes, we will process that personal information on the lawful basis of your consent.
For the other purposes listed above (except where we are fulfilling a legal obligation) we process your personal information on the lawful basis that it is in our legitimate interests to do so. We do not believe, considering the nature and extent of the personal information that you provide to us, and the technical and organisational security measures that we apply to our processing of that information, that those interests materially impact any of your rights, freedom or your own interests.
If we ask you or invite you to provide any sensitive personal information to us for any reason, for example information relating to your health or dietary habits, we will always ask for your consent to use that data, and we will not use it without your consent. If you give consent you can withdraw that consent at any time.
3. How we share your information
We use other businesses to provide certain services to us, or to you on our behalf, such as fulfilling orders, sending emails, telemarketing, organising and managing competitions, promotions, surveys and polls, website analysis, data analysis and processing credit card payments. These service providers will have access to your personal information, but only to the extent necessary to provide their services. We do not permit these service providers to make any use of any personal information they process except to provide their services, and they will not contact you unless we give them express permission to do so for the purposes of providing the services.
If you have given your consent to such sharing as part of the registration process or subsequently, we will share your personal information with the applicable group companies and/or associated third parties and (unless you give them further consents) they can only use it to send you the information that you have requested. Their use of your personal information will be otherwise subject to their own privacy policies. We are not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of any third party. You can stop receiving this information at any time by following the unsubscribe instructions on the emails that you receive, by amending your marketing preferences or by emailing info@healthyfoodguide.co.uk.
We may use a third-party network advertiser to serve the advertisements on this website and we may use an audience or traffic measurement service to analyse the traffic on this website. Network advertisers enable us to serve relevant advertisements to you based on your visits to this website and other websites you have visited. Audience and traffic measurement services allow us to collect anonymous traffic and behavioural information from the website by monitoring anonymous visitor activity. This website’s advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may themselves collect information from cookies which they set on your computer if you choose to have your cookies enabled in your browser. See more detail as to the use of cookies in our cookie policy.
We may share your personal data with a third-party auditing organisation (The Audit Bureau of Circulations Ltd) so they can verify aggregated statistics about circulation and usage of our products or review our policies, processes and procedures for compliance with relevant standards. You can view their privacy policy by following this link.
We may share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information, such as demographics and website usage statistics, with advertisers, sponsors and other organisations.
4. Where your personal information is transmitted outside the EEA
Some of our service providers are based outside, or process data outside, the EEA. Because there is a higher risk in the processing of personal information in jurisdictions that do not share the same security standards as countries in the EEA we are obliged to ensure that our contracts with such service providers (who act as data processors) contain standard clauses approved by the European Commission in its decision 2010/87/EU, which you can read if you wish via this link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en. In the case of processors in the US who have self-certified under the US-EU Privacy Shield scheme the certification provides the equivalent protection to these clauses.
5. Retention and deletion of your information
We will not keep your personal information for any longer than required for the purposes for which it is collected, unless there is a legal obligation on us to keep it for a longer period. When it is no longer required your personal information will be deleted.
6. Your rights
You have the following rights under data protection legislation. If you have any questions about your rights, or you wish to exercise any of these rights, please email info@healthyfoodguide.co.uk.
Information Access: You have the right to access and receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you, including the details and purposes of the processing, the organisations to which your personal information is disclosed, and other information that we are obliged to give you about our processing. If you wish to access any of your personal information please contact us giving details of the information you require.
Information accuracy: We have an obligation to keep the personal information we hold about you accurate and up to date, and you have the right to ensure that we do. Please notify us as soon as possible in the event of any change to your personal information.
Information Erasure: You have the right to ask that we erase your personal information (the ‘right to be forgotten’) in certain limited circumstances. We will let you know if any of those circumstances apply on request.
Restriction on processing: You have the right to restrict us from processing your personal information in certain limited circumstances. We will let you know if any of those circumstances apply on request.
Information Portability: You may have the right to require us to transfer the personal information we hold about you to a third party in machine-readable format. Please contact us to find out whether your right applies.
Right to object: If at any point we process your personal information on the basis of our legitimate interests, or on the basis that it is in the public interest to do so, you have the right to object to that processing. In any event, you have the right to request that we do not use your personal information for any direct marketing purposes.
Automated decision-making: Finally, you have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated decision-making that has significant prejudicial effect on you. We do not take any such decisions on this basis
If you contact us by telephone, email or by any other remote means we may require proof of ID before acting.
If you contact us to exercise your rights we will respond as required under data protection legislation, but please note that not all rights are absolute. Sometimes they may not apply, or other legal obligations or third party rights will take precedence.
