HealthLeaders Media wants you to fully understand what information we gather from you, how that information is collected, how that information is used, and how you can control the collection and/or use of information about you. So please read this Policy carefully.
The Privacy Policy for HealthLeadersMedia.com (“Site”) constitutes a legal agreement between you and BLR (“Agreement”). We reserve the right to amend this Agreement at any time, without prior notice, which amendment(s) are to be fully effective upon posting on the Site. By accessing the content and services made available on this Site (collectively “Services”), you are agreeing to all the terms and conditions of the Agreement, whether or not you register as a member of the Services.

This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the HealthLeadersMedia.com Terms of Use.
2. Personally Identifiable Information
There are cases in which HealthLeaders Media may ask you for personally identifiable information, such as your name, mailing address, and e-mail address (“Personally Identifiable Information”). For example, we request Personally Identifiable Information for online shopping or transactions or for other services that require registration or subscription. We may also collect information from e-mail, letters, or other correspondence that you send us. HealthLeaders Media will not collect any Personally Identifiable Information about you unless you provide it to us voluntarily, with the exception of your computer's IP address. The IP address is an identifier unique to each computer or Internet usage session.
When you do provide us with Personally Identifiable Information, HealthLeaders Media may:
Store and process that information to enhance your experience with HealthLeaders Media so that we provide a service that is relevant and easy to use;
Use that information to contact you for informational, marketing, and promotional purposes on behalf of HealthLeaders Media and third parties, including such benefits as welcoming you back to HealthLeaders Media or informing you of service enhancements or promotional items;
To the extent required to provide our services, share Personally Identifiable Information with any merchants that may offer their products and services through HealthLeaders Media;
Share information about your product purchases through HealthLeaders Media with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, or other third parties;
Disclose that Information to third parties when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) HealthLeaders Media's rights or property, other members or users of HealthLeaders Media, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities; and
Disclose that information to third parties when we believe in good faith that the disclosure is required by law or a court of competent jurisdiction; and
As HealthLeaders Media continues to develop its business, we may sell or buy other businesses or assets. A buyer or successor will have access to our customer lists as this information is considered a transferable business asset.
Except as stated in this Policy, or as otherwise stated at the time that the Personally Identifiable Information is gathered, we will not provide Personally Identifiable Information to third parties.
BLR is not a legal services provider and your use of the Site does not create an attorney/client or other confidential or privileged relationship.
BLR may give you the opportunity to share materials (“Contributions”) through various forums and blogs that BLR may make available through the Services. If elect to submit Contributions, all portions of such Contributions will become publicly available and may be viewed by anyone. Any Personally Identifiable Information that you elect to include as part of your Contributions will cease to be considered Personally Identifiable Information hereunder.
