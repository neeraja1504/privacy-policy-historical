Our business model
We teach dog owners how to care for their dogs using nutrition to improve health and longevity.

If you choose to subscribe to our newsletter, we will periodically send you links to our blog posts and videos which teach you different aspects of canine nutrition. In most blog posts, we provide links to relevent products of ours for you to purchase if you wish to understand the topic at a greater depth.

Automatic Collection of Information
As is typical, our web host logs http requests to their server. This means that we know the originating IP (e.g. 18.29.0.1) address of a user agent requesting a URL. We also know the Referrer and User-Agent information accompanied with an HTTP request. They do not log the specific identity of visitors. We occasionally analyze the log files to determine which files are most requested and the previous site or user agent which prompted the request. Our logging is passive; we do not use technologies such as cookies to maintain any information on users. Logged information is kept indefinitely as administrative and research material; it is not disclosed outside of our organization. Aggregate (completely non-identifying) statistics generated from these logs may be reported as part of research results.
