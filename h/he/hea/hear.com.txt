We collect and analyze non-personal information to evaluate how visitors use our website. Aggregate data we collect may include pages visited on the site, unique URLs visited within the site, browser type, and IP address. Most non-personal data is collected via cookies or other analysis technologies.

Like many sites, we use “cookies” to collect information. You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent; however, if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of our site. Some of our business partners may use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers); however, we have no access to or control over these cookies.

We are in compliance with the requirements of COPPA (Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act) and we do not collect any information from anyone under 13 years of age. Our website, products and services are all directed to people who are at least 13 years old or older.
Security
We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you enter, submit, or access your personal information. We offer the use of a secure server.

Your rights to access and control your health information
We want you to know that you have the following rights to access and control your health information.
1. Right To Inspect and Copy Records. You have the right to inspect and obtain a copy of any of your health information that may be used to make decisions about you and your treatment for as long as we maintain this information in our records. This includes medical and billing records. To inspect or obtain a copy of your health information, please submit your request in writing to us as at the address mentioned on top of this statement. If you request a copy of the information, we may charge a fee for the costs of copying, mailing, or other supplies we use to fulfill your request. Under certain very limited circumstances, we may deny your request to inspect or obtain a copy of your information. If we do, we will provide a written denial that explains our reasons for doing so, and a complete description of your rights to have that decision reviewed and how you can exercise those rights.
2. Right to Amend Records. If you believe that the health information we have about you is incorrect or incomplete, you may ask us to amend the information for as long as the information is kept in our records. To request an amendment, please write us at the address mentioned on top of this statement. Your request should include the reasons why you think we should make the amendment. If we deny part or all of your request, we will provide a written notice that explains our reasons for doing so. You will have the right to have certain information related to your requested amendment included in your records.
3. Right to an Accounting of Disclosures. You have a right to request an “accounting of disclosures,” which identifies certain other persons or organizations to whom we have disclosed your health information in accordance with applicable law and the protections afforded in this Notice. Many routine disclosures we make will not be included in this accounting; however, the accounting will include many non-routine disclosures. To request an accounting of disclosures, please write us at the address mentioned on top of this statement and indicate a time period within the past six years for the disclosures you want us to include. You have a right to receive one accounting within every twelve month period for free. However, we may charge you for the cost of providing any additional accounting in that same twelve month period.
4. Right to Request Additional Privacy Protections. You have the right to request that we further restrict the way we use and disclose your health information to treat your condition, collect payment for that treatment, or run our business operations. You may also request that we limit how we disclose information about you to family or friends involved in your care. To request restrictions, please write us at the address mentioned on top of this statement. We are not required to agree to your request for a restriction, and in some cases the restriction you request may not be permitted under law. However, if we do agree, we will be bound by our agreement unless the information is needed to provide you with emergency treatment or comply with the law. Once we have agreed to a restriction, you have the right to revoke the restriction at any time. Under some circumstances, we will also have the right to revoke the restriction as long as we notify you before doing so. In other cases, we will need your permission before we can revoke the restriction. You have the right to restrict certain disclosures of protected health information to a health plan where you pay, or someone has paid on your behalf out of pocket and in full. You have the right to revoke the restriction at any time.
5. Right to Request Confidential Communications. You have the right to request that we contact you about your medical matters in a way that is more confidential for you, such as calling you at home instead of at work. To request more confidential communications, please write us at the address mentioned on top of this statement. We will not ask you the reason for your request, and we will try to accommodate all reasonable requests.
6. Right to Have Someone Act On Your Behalf. You have the right to name a personal representative who may act on your behalf to control the privacy of your health information. Parents and guardians will generally have the right to control the privacy of health information about minors unless the minors are permitted by law to act on their own behalf.
