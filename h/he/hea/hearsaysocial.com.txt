These third party service providers are limited to only accessing or using this data to provide services to us and must provide reasonable assurances that they will appropriately safeguard the data.
Compliance with Laws. We may disclose your data to a third party if (i) we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or government request (including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements), (ii) to enforce our agreements and policies, (iii) to protect the security or integrity of the Hearsay Website or our services and products, (iv) to protect ourselves, our other customers, or the public from harm or illegal activities, or (v) to respond to an emergency which we believe in good faith requires us to disclose data to assist in preventing a death or serious bodily injury.

How we treat Do-Not-Track Signals
Certain internet web browsers allow a “do not track” (DNT) setting that relies on a technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to websites visited by the individual about the individual’s browser DNT setting. At this time, we do not currently respond to DNT signals, whether that signal is received on a computer or on a mobile device. Learn more about DNT here.

3. SERVICES
Below is a description of what data we gather from you as a user of our Services, which you access through our account portal, https://my.hearsaysocial.com/, when you log into your user account with Hearsay. Information about data collected through the Hearsay Website is located in the Section I “Hearsay Website” above.
In this section, “You” may refer to a variety of people, including
Individuals, entities and others who have entered into a subscription license agreement with Hearsay for the Services (“Customers”)
Individuals, entities or others who use the Services (“Users”)
Individuals, entities and others who interact with the Services (“End User Contacts”)
If there are special terms and considerations, we will address the individual group by the capitalized term (Customer, User or End User Contacts). Where terms apply to all groups, we will address the group as “you.”
What data we collect, how we collect it and why
Customers and Users may give us data directly. Through the Services, Customers and Users can populate their accounts with information submitted by a Customer or a User to Hearsay, or uploaded by Customer or a User to the Services, that is meant to be used and shared within the Services. Examples of User Content include articles maintained within the content library, logos and other assets uploaded by a User to personalize their webpage. In uploading or submitting this information, Customers and Users must not include any personally identifiable information contained within the uploaded materials.
Hearsay may also contact Customers and Users to provide feedback on the Services by email, telephone or other means in order to better understand how Customers and Users use the Services. Some of the questions might include requests to provide certain personally identifiable information, such as name, age, geographic location, etc. Any information gathered by Hearsay will be used solely in connection to improve or expand the Services; however, this may include using this information within 3rd party services that are associated with the Services. Please see our cookies section to better understand how we use performance cookies to improve the Services.
You may give us data through the Service. You may give us data through the Services in multiple ways. These options are not mutually exclusive to one another:
Customers may have given us data about End User Contacts. Our Customers maintain their own Privacy Policies on how they collect, retain and share data collected from End User Contacts. In handling User Data about End User Contacts, Hearsay processes and retains information in accordance with those privacy policies.
If you are an End User Contact, you may have been directed to review this Privacy Policy by one of our Customers in lieu of their own Privacy Policy. In this case, any data about you as an End User Contact will be processed and maintained as if it were User Data. Please read the sections regarding processing and retention of User Data for additional details.
Users and End User Contacts may give us data by interacting with the Services. Hearsay allows Users to connect certain digital assets such as social media accounts, email addresses and telephone numbers to the Services in order to communicate with End User Contacts.
Hearsay uses that connected information in order to collect information about the End User Contact, depending on the level of permission. For instance, when using social media networks, if Hearsay is allowed to collect social media activity about the End User Contact, Hearsay will collect such information and present a summary of this information to the User. In the case of text message correspondence, Hearsay may collect, store and retain the telephone number of the End User Contact, call history with the End User Contact, and any contents of a text message that an End User Contact made in text message communications with the User.
Any User Data that a User or an End User Contact submits to the Services will be captured and retained by Hearsay as part of the Services.
You may give us data automatically. Certain Customers integrate their customer relationship management (CRM) systems with the Services. When this happens, Hearsay receives any information about Users and End User Contacts that a Customer has collected and wishes to share with Hearsay. Hearsay will use this information within the Service to enable certain functionality (e.g., populating email contacts from a CRM will allow a User to utilize email functionality), or use insights in order to recommend certain actions (e.g., based on a combination of activity documented in CRM and the Services with an End User Contact, a User might receive a recommendation to make a future communication with the same End User Contact).
Additionally, when you use the Services, we and our service providers acting on our behalf automatically collect certain data using tracking technologies like cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies.
A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier that is sent to your browser from a website’s computers and stored on your computer’s hard drive.
These technologies are used to help us better understand user behavior and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of the Services. We treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non-personal information.
We use cookies to record current session information. We also use third party cookies (e.g. Google Analytics) to provide anonymized and aggregated information on website usage statistics and patterns.
Hearsay uses web beacons with cookies or separately to compile information about your engagement with the Company. Web beacons are clear electronic images that can recognize certain types of information on your computer, such as cookies, when you viewed a particular website tied to the web beacon, and a description of a website tied to the web beacon.
Learn more about web beacons, and how we use them in the “Cookies” section of our privacy policy.
We may collect publicly available information about Users and End User Contacts.
In order to better understand Users and provide a better experience, Hearsay creates various “profiles” within the Services, in order to provide more targeted content and suggest action items for a User to take within the Services. “Profiles” are not composites of personal information nor based on actual individuals, but are common characteristics identified by Hearsay to describe certain behaviors or preferences. In order to make recommendations or suggest content, Hearsay endeavors to find out more about its Users and End User Contacts.
When building these “profiles,” Hearsay may retain third parties to collect publicly available information about Users. This information may include your industry, the size of your office, and your online directory listing, to help Hearsay understand more about our customer base and to tailor information we send you about the Services.
We may acquire anonymized aggregated data that relate to You. Hearsay has developed proprietary algorithms that monitor all communications and transactions that occur within the Services. Hearsay may also engage third parties to perform data analysis on data sets provided by Hearsay in order to improve Hearsay’s algorithms. The purpose of these algorithms is to identify patterns of behavior, either unique to a User or to defined categories of people, which may enhance a User’s use of the Services. Any data created or identified within an algorithm does not identify the activity of an individual User or End User Contacts. For example, the Services may identify that a User’s social media network contacts are most active between the hours of 10 AM to 12 PM on weekdays, and would therefore recommend a User to schedule social media posts during this time. The Services algorithms gather this information based on the volume activity occurring within this network; this recommendation, or any data associated with this recommendation, would not identify the posting habits of any individual End User Contact or a User. For text message communication, the Services may suggest prepopulated quick replies to certain text messages. The Services algorithms make these suggestions based on gathered information of previous replies and conversations.
Additionally, Hearsay may also collect information relating to the industry that a User is associated with: acquiring data sets about certain financial services industries, reviewing census results to identify purchasing habits of consumers, etc. The purpose of acquiring this information is to provide more information and insight for the User when using the Services.
What we use your data for
Generally, we use all the data that you provide to us or that we collect from you to provide the Services to you, to enable you to access and use the Services, to deliver your communications to their intended destination, and to analyze your use of the Services, to improve, enhance and expand our products and services, and to detect fraudulent or unlawful activity in connection with your Hearsay account.
Who we may share your data with
Unless you give us your permission, we won’t share your User Data with third parties, except as described below:
External Services. The Services allow you to send or receive communications to End User Contacts through social media, email and text messaging communications. If you send communications through the Services, Hearsay will deliver those communications to third parties in order for the End User Contact to share and receive those communications. We call these third party delivery networks “External Services.” Examples of External Services include Facebook, Twitter, Google+ (for social media), Amazon Web Services (for website hosting), Sendgrid (for email delivery), and Twilio (for text messaging). How these External Services handle your communications once that information is handed off to the External Service network is determined their own policies.

We may share data collected from you through the Services with third-party service providers or consultants who need access to the data to perform their work on Hearsay’s behalf.

We may disclose your data pertaining to a regulatory audit conducted by these entities as well as oversight organizations for the financial services industry, such as FINRA, SEC, or similar state and international regulators. When responding to a financial services regulatory audit, we will first contact Customer before disclosing any such information. The Customer would be responsible for contact any Users or End User Contacts as part of the regulatory audit.
Compliance with Laws. We may disclose your data to a third party if (i) we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or government request (including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements), (ii) to enforce our agreements and policies, (iii) to protect the security or integrity of the Hearsay Website or our services and products, (iv) to protect ourselves, our other customers, or the public from harm or illegal activities, or (v) to respond to an emergency which we believe in good faith requires us to disclose data to assist in preventing a death or serious bodily injury. If Hearsay is required by law to disclose any of your data that directly identifies you, then we will use reasonable efforts to provide you with notice of that disclosure requirement, unless we are prohibited from doing so by statute, subpoena or court or administrative order.
