Privacy Policy
Heat Nation knows that you care about how your personal information is used and
shared, and we take your privacy very seriously. Please read the following
to learn more about our privacy policy. By visiting our website, you are
accepting the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy covers Heat Nation’s treatment of personal information that
Heat Nation gathers when you are on the Heat Nation website and when you use
Heat Nation services. This policy does not apply to the practices of third
parties that Heat Nation does not own or control, or to individuals that
Heat Nation does not employ or manage.
Information Collected by Heat Nation
We only collect personal information that is relevant to the purpose of our
website. This information allows us to provide you with a customized and
efficient experience. We do not process this information in a way that is
incompatible with this objective. We collect the following types of
information from our Heat Nation users:
1. Information You Provide to Us: We receive and store any information you
enter on our website or provide to us in any other way. You can choose not
to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to
take advantage of many of our special features.
2. Automatic Information:
We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact
with us. Heat Nation and its authorized agents automatically receive and record
certain “traffic data” on their server logs from your browser including
your IP address, Heat Nation cookie information, and the page you requested.
Heat Nation uses this traffic data to help diagnose problems with its servers,
analyze trends and administer the website.
o Heat Nation may collect and, on any page, display the total counts that page
has been viewed.
Many companies offer programs that help you to visit websites anonymously.
While Heat Nation will not be able to provide you with a personalized
experience if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these
programs are available.
E-mail Communications
Heat Nation is very concerned about your privacy and we will never provide your
email address to a third party without your explicit permission, as
detailed in the “Sharing Your Information” section below. Heat Nation may send
out e-mails with Heat Nation-related news, products, offers, surveys or
promotions.
Cookies
Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s
hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your
browser and tell us how and when pages in our website are visited and by
how many people. Heat Nation cookies do not collect personal information, and
we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personal
information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or e-mail
address is.
The “help” portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct
you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to
command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to
fully disable cookies. We recommend that you leave the cookies activated
because cookies allow you to use some of Heat Nation’s coolest features.
Heat Nation’s advertising partners may place a cookie on your browser that
makes it possible to collect anonymous non-personally identifiable
information that ad delivery systems use to present more relevant ads. If
you would prefer to opt-out of this standard practice, please visit our
advertising partner Platform-A’s privacy policy and opt-out page.
Sharing Your Information

these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the
business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if Heat Nation, or substantially
all of its assets, were acquired, user information would be one of the
assets that is transferred.
Protection of Heat Nation and Others: We may release personal information when
we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with a law; to
enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other policies; or to protect the
rights, property, or safety of Heat Nation, our employees, our users, or
others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and
organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
