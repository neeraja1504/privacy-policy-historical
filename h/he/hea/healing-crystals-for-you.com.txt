Privacy Policy For Healing Crystals For You
Your privacy is as important to me as it is to you.
Here's how I deal with it.
My name is Liz Oakes and I’m the owner and founder of this website, “Healing-Crystals-For-You.com”.
My own privacy is important to me when I visit other people's websites, so I understand how important privacy is. The information you share with me is as important to me as it is to you.
I’ve taken steps under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to make sure any information you give me is secure, only seen by people who need to see it, and within your control.
You can find out exactly why I need the information, what happens to it, who will see it and how I keep it secure by reading this privacy policy. If you’re still unsure, you’ll be able to contact me.
I maintain the highest standards of honesty and fairness in everything I write for this website, and I apply exactly the same standards when I deal with the information you trust me with.
Why I Need To Collect Information In The First Place
Some of the reasons I need to collect information are to:
run this site so it displays information correctly, and to improve it when it doesn't
make your experience of using the site more personal and enjoyable
improve the products and service I offer you
improve my customer service, and help me respond to your requests more efficiently
reply to any enquiries, questions or requests
send information which you agree to receive about topics I think will interest you.
Why I Collect Your Personal Information
I never collect personally identifiable information (that is, information which may identify you such as your name or email address) without your knowledge.
If I ask for personal information it's because you have volunteered to give it to me, for example if you get in touch through my ‘contact’ page.
I only collect your personal information when I need it. I need it for these reasons:
When you contact me for any reason, using one of my contact forms, you agree to give me your name and email address so I can reply to you.
If you fill in a form on the “Your Crystal Story” pages where you write a story or ask a question about crystals, I ask for your name and email address. You can also send photographs. You don’t have to fill that information in or send photos if you don’t want to. If you do, the information and photo will appear on the page about your crystal story.
This information remains on the website for as long as you want your story to stay. If you’d prefer it to be taken off, you just need to get in touch with me.
If you give me personal information, I give you a 100% promise in return that the information will be used only for the reason you’ve shared it.
I hate spam. I will never send you any information you have not requested.
Where Your Information Goes
I will never share your personal information with anyone for commercial or any other use. It will be used only for the purpose you provided it on this website.
Sometimes, though, for specific reasons, I need to share your information with someone else.
I make sure I only use other individuals and companies I know and trust. I have also been careful to make sure they are also compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation, so I am confident they will also keep your data safe.
The only company who may currently hold your information is:
If you submit your story to one of the “Your Crystal Stories” pages, SiteSell, the company which hosts my website, stores your information securely on their servers.
Your Rights Within The General Data Protection Regulation
Europe's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was introduced specifically to protect the data of individuals. Although at present it only protects people in Europe, my view is that its extremely high standards should be a protection for everyone, worldwide.
I value everyone who visits this website, wherever you may come from. Which is why all my policies and practices, not just those which impact on Europeans, follow GDPR's requirements. So this privacy policy is my statement to you of my commitment to protect your personal information.
If you would like to update that information or you want to have it deleted from my records, you just need to click on this link and let me know.
If you think your personal information is not being used properly and you want to make a complaint, you should firstly contact me and ask me to put right whatever is wrong, explaining the problem as clearly as you can.
If you’re not satisfied with my response, you have every right to lodge a formal complaint. The best way to do this is to contact a lawyer and say you want to complain under the terms of the GDPR.
How You Can Correct or Remove Your Personal Information
I provide this privacy policy as a statement to you of my commitment to protect your personal information.
If you have submitted personal information through my website and would like that information deleted from my records or would like to update or correct that information, or if you have any further questions, please be sure to use my contact page to talk to me.
Non-personal Information And "Cookies"
Personal information, such as your name and email address, is never collected automatically. I only have it when you choose to give it me.
However, when you visit Healing Crystals For You.com, some statistical information is collected automatically. The reason I collect it is so that I can constantly improve your experience of visiting my site.
This type of information includes the name of your Internet Service Provider, your Internet Protocol address, the name of your internet browser, and other numerical data such as which pages you visited, how many pages you looked at and how long you stayed on the site.
This information helps me know which parts of my site you’re most interested in. That means I can make sure I write articles which focus on the subjects you’re most likely to want to read.
Cookies :
That information is collected by means of “cookies”. A cookie is a tiny bit of code placed by this website on your computer.
Each time you come here, your browser gives my computer that code so I know that you've come back. That helps me know the kinds of articles that are most helpful to you.
Cookies
Statcounter:
Statcounter is an online service which helps us to understand our visitors; for example, how visitors find our website, how long they spend on our site, which web pages they are most interested in etc.
I use Statcounter because better understanding how visitors are interacting with my website helps me to improve the content, design and functionality of my site. This allows me to offer a better online experience to my visitors.
Statcounter uses cookies and other technologies to collect data on visitors and visitor activity on our website. This data includes:
Time and date of visit (this can help us to identify and plan for busy periods on our website)

I use a service called Google Analytics to analyse how you use this website. It collects demographic data and information about your interests, for example, by means of cookies.

Disabling either cookies or web beacons should not cause a problem with the continued use of this website, but it may prevent some of its interactive features from working properly.
Advertising
I use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on this website. These companies use cookies and web beacons in their ads to check how many times you've seen an advertisement.
I do not provide them with any personally identifiable information for cookie or web beacon use, so they cannot personally identify you with that information from this website. You can opt out of personalized ads from up to 125 different ad networks by clicking on this link.
