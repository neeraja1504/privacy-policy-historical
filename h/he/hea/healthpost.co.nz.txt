Collection of Your Information
We collect information about you through our website in an effort to improve your shopping experience, as well as communicate with you about our products, services and promotions. We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties for commercial gain.
We will generally never give, lease, sell or otherwise disclose your personal information to any third parties except to comply with law; facilitate court proceedings; enforce our Terms & Conditions; or protect the rights, property, or safety of HealthPost Ltd, our users, or others. We may however share or store your email address and other basic information with our third party business partners including marketing, advertising and research companies and data analysis companies.  We do this in order to conduct sales, marketing and advertising research and analysis on our behalf so that we can: better understand your preferences; improve the services we offer you; present you with suitable offers that you might be interested in. We will only do this with reputable organisations who are acting directly on our behalf to improve the services we offer you, and not for any other purpose (and certainly not to promote their own products and services directly to you). We also need to store your personal information within the hardware and software systems of reputable third parties in order to facilitate and improve the services which we offer. The privacy and data security policies and standards of the third party organisations we engage for these purposes will be subject to review by HealthPost, and required to meet high standards of care and responsibility.
We may be obliged to release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with law; facilitate court proceedings; enforce or apply our terms and conditions; or protect the rights, property, or safety of HealthPost Ltd, our users, or others.  To the extent we are legally permitted to do so, we will take reasonable steps to notify you in the event that we are required to provide your personal information to third parties as part of a legal process.

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

Cookies
Our website uses "cookies," which are small data files that are stored on your computer when you visit a website. Cookies enable you to shop on our website and may be used in a variety of ways to enhance or personalize your online browsing and shopping experience.

Third-party cookies are cookies supplied by our partners and are used for analytical and advertising purposes. While these cookies are completely anonymous in that they don’t provide us or any third party with any personally identifiable information about you (e.g. your name or address), it does track certain things like how long you spent on our site, and which pages you did or didn't visit. This allows us to use Remarketing functionality as described below and analyze aggregated traffic data and users behaviour on our site.
Accepting a cookie will not give us access to any data on your computer other than the data stored in the cookie. Although you may configure your web browser to not accept cookies, you may experience a loss of functionality as a result.

Third-Party Remarketing
When you visit our website with cookies enabled, we place a third party cookie supplied by Google, Facebook, Criteo or other partners onto your browser for remarketing purposes. For example, if you visited a particular product, we might use this information to display advertising to you promoting a special offer specific to this product. This advertising may be displayed to you as you browse other sites across the internet. This is possible because many websites participate in third-party's advertising programme, allowing them to use parts of their sites to display promotional messages from participating advertisers. You may also see our advertisements on sites directly owned or controlled by Google, such as Youtube or on Facebook.
You may opt out of Google's use of cookies for advertising at www.google.com/settings/ads. You may opt out of Criteo's use of cookies for advertising at www.criteo.com/privacy. To manage your Facebook preferences go to: www.facebook.com/ads/preferences.

To process and fulfil your order, including sending emails to confirm your order status and shipment, along with customary business communications.
To verify your identity and to assist you if you have forgotten your username or password
To communicate with you and to send you information by email, postal mail or other means about our products, services and promotions, where you agree to receive such information.

Business Continuity
In the event that HealthPost’s business is acquired or merged or in the unlikely event HealthPost Ltd goes out of business enters into liquidation or receivership. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of HealthPost Ltd may continue to use the information collected by HealthPost.
Website and Credit Card Security
We take website and credit card security extremely seriously.
HealthPost endeavour to provide a safe and secure platform on which to conduct online transactions. www.healthpost.co.nz uses the industry standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol, which encrypts your personal information as it is transmitted over the internet. This encryption scrambles details such as your password and address so that generally, other computers are unable to decipher the information, ensuring privacy and security. To make sure you are accessing a secure server, check for a closed padlock symbol in your browser window.  In the latest versions of the Chrome and Firefox browsers, this appears before the URL itself in the browswer address bar, in Internet Explorer it's shown to the right of the address. If this appears, then SSL is active. You can double check this by looking at the URL as well. If SSL is active, then the first characters of that line will read ‘https’ rather than just ‘http’. It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer.
No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
Please ensure you sign out when you have finished visiting www.healthpost.co.nz, especially if you access our website from a shared computer.
We use Payment Express to process all credit card payments. For more info, please refer to their privacy policy.
