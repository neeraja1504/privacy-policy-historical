The HC Support Network provides information, communication, support and awareness for the herpes virus. As part of this role we are committed to maintaining a high level of privacy for our visitors.

We run a public forum where the contents are crawled and indexed regulary by search engines. This includes user names, threads and posts (all conversations on the forums). For this reason please choose a user name that is confidential. Other account information, such as your email address and password, are automatically private.
Never Post Personal Information
The forum community at the HC Support Network is public, which means anyone who is surfing the internet is welcome to come in and join our conversations. Do not post any private details such as you or someone else’s real name, street address or telephone number – this type of information will be removed if detected. Please login to your account and change your username if it contains any detail that you could be recognized by. It must be completely anonymous.
Your profile page and photo, if you have uploaded one, is restricted to members only. This means that only other logged in members can view this information. However, all of the posts and threads on our forum – including your username and avatar, the image beside your name, are public for all to see. For this reason, please do not use your real name, nickname or a username that you use anywhere else, such as on messenger or other social networking sites, unless you wish to be recognized.
Closing an Account and Deleting Threads
If a you wish to close an account please contact us. In most cases the HC staff will delete your email address and close the account so that you are no longer associated with the forum. Normally posts and threads that have already been posted will not be removed as it leaves missing and incomplete information on the forums, affects other members’ post counts and takes manual labor to do.
Once a person reaches the post count of 2 or more posts they have the ability to edit their own posts, provided the post is no more than 7 days old. If there is a special circumstance where you need to remove a thread or a post please contact us so that we can help you.
