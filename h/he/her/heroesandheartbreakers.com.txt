Cookies and Online Tracking
A “cookie” is a text file that websites send to a visitor’s computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. We use two kinds of cookies on the Sites: session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies exist only for as long as your browser remains open. Once you exit your browser, they disappear. Persistent cookies, in contrast, last from visit to visit; they remain on your hard drive after you exit your browser. The cookies used on the Sites include those which are strictly necessary cookies for access and navigation, cookies that track usage (performance cookies), remember your choices (functionality cookies), and cookies that provide you with targeted content or advertising (described more below under “Interest-based Advertising”). Your browser may tell you how to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies or how to restrict or disable certain types of cookies. Please note, however, that without cookies, you may not be able to use all of the features of our Sites.
We may use the information we obtain from your use of our cookies for the following purposes:

We also may use “web beacons” on our Sites. A web beacon, also known as a pixel tag or clear GIF, may be used to transmit information collected through cookies back to our service providers’ servers.

Interest-based Advertising

You may see certain ads on other websites or in your emails based on your visits to our Sites and third-party sites because we participate in advertising networks administered by third-party vendors, such as Google AdWords. Ad networks allow us (including our third party partners like our authors) to target messaging to users considering demographic data, users’ inferred interests and browsing context. These networks track your online activities over time by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of cookies, web server logs and web beacons. The networks use this information to show you advertisements that are tailored to your individual interests, to track your browser across multiple websites, and to build a profile of your web browsing. The information our ad network vendors collect includes information about your visits to websites that participate in the vendors’ advertising networks, such as the pages or advertisements you view and the actions you take on the websites. This data collection takes place both on our Sites and on third-party websites that participate in the ad networks. This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.

We have no control over or access to the information that is collected, stored, or used by third-party plugins. If you engage with our content on or through third-party social media sites, you may allow us to have access to certain information associated with your social media account (e.g., name, username, email address, profile picture) to deliver the content or as part of the operation of the plug-in or application.

Note to EU Individuals only: Our EU Processing for the above purposes will be on the basis that it is necessary: (i) for our legitimate interests where these do not override your own interests, rights and freedoms and our legitimate interests include the operation of the Sites and our other business activities in an effective and efficient manner in order to publish and promote our products and services, our business and our brand and to provide you with, or to engage with you in order to be able to provide others, with interesting, engaging and appropriate content, events and activities; (ii) to perform a contract we have entered into or are about to enter into with you personally; or (iii) to comply with legal and regulatory requirements and requests.

In some cases there may be overlap between these different bases. In compliance with the above, please note that we may undertake some EU Processing without your specific knowledge or consent where this is required or permitted by law, but if you would like more information about our EU Processing please contact us at any time. Unless otherwise required or permitted by law, before we begin EU Processing of your personal data for a purpose unrelated to those above, we will notify you and explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.
Information We Share
We may share the information you provide with companies that are related to Macmillan through common ownership.
In addition, we may share information about you with non-affiliated third parties whose products or services may be of interest to you. These third parties may contact you about their products and services. We will not share your information with these third parties for their own marketing purposes if you request that we not do so. See below in the Section titled Your Choices for how to opt-out. We may, however, engage in joint marketing activities with selected third parties and may share personal information about our Site visitors with them.
Note to EU Individuals only and Canadian Individuals only: We do not share your personal data with affiliated or unaffiliated third parties for them to contact you with email marketing about their products or services or for joint email marketing purposes without having obtained your prior opt-in consent (see the Your Choices section below).
Unless you have opted out, we may also share certain information such as your email address with Facebook, Google, Amazon, Twitter, and other third parties so that we can serve targeted ads and content to you and others with similar interests on such third parties’ respective sites (see the Your Choices section below for more information on how to opt out). These third parties use the data to help target our ads to you and others. This is called custom audiences and matching.
We share personal information with third parties who perform services on our behalf. For example: when you make a purchase, we may share information about you and your transaction with other companies for the purpose of processing your transaction, and we may retain outside companies to manage databases of customer information, to provide advertising services and to distribute e-mail offerings.
Our Sites may feature blogs, forums, discussion groups and comments. Please be aware that some or all of the information you provide (including personally identifiable information) in connection with these activities may be made publicly available. In addition, some of our Sites provide for user registration including a user profile. In such case, the following information may automatically be available to all other users of such Site: your display name, your photo (if uploaded), and how long you’ve been a registered user. In addition, if you’ve included any optional information in your profile, this information may also be available to all other users.
We or our Canadian, US and other service providers also may disclose information about you: (i) if we are permitted or required to do so by law, regulation or legal process (such as in response to a court order or subpoena, which may include lawful access by Canadian, U.S. or other foreign governmental authorities, courts or law enforcement agencies); (ii) in response to requests by government agencies, such as law enforcement authorities; or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity. We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you in the event of a prospective or completed merger, sale or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets (including in the event of a reorganization, dissolution or liquidation). Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will provide such entity with this Privacy and Cookie Notice so that they are aware of the terms hereunder.
