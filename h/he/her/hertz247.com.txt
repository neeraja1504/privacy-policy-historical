(b) INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS
Some of the uses and disclosures mentioned in this Policy may involve the transfer of your Personal Data to various countries around the world that may have different levels of privacy protection than your country of residence or interaction with us, such as when you request rental services to be provided to you in a country outside the European Union (“EU”).
Where our transfer of your data is necessary to provide rental services requested by you, the legal basis for the transfer is the contractual necessity of the transfer, and your Personal Data will be processed by the company providing the services you requested in accordance with applicable local law.
Where we transfer your Personal Data to a third party outside the European Union and no legal basis applies, such as where we transfer the data to a company processing it to our instruction to enable us to provide our services, we will ensure that the required safeguards are in place for the transfer. These include (i) where the entity receiving the data is located in a country recognized by the European Union as having adequate safeguards in place; (ii) where the transfer is to the United States, where the recipient company participates in the EU-US Privacy Shield (see below); or (iii) where we have entered into EU approved standard contractual clauses with the recipient to protect the data. For example:
(i)
|
EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework: We may store your Personal Data on our servers, primarily located in the United States. The Hertz Corporation and its subsidiaries in the U.S. (individually and collectively, the "Company") participates in the Privacy Shield. The Company's participation applies to Personal Data received in the United States from the European Union ("EU"). We are committed to treating such EU Personal Data in accordance with the Privacy Shield principles, including Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability. To learn more about the Privacy Shield, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce's Privacy Shield List at www.privacyshield.gov
---|---
(ii)
|
EU Standard Contractual Clauses: Where we transfer your Personal Data outside of the European Economic Area other than to the Company or any other organization in the U.S. which participates in the Privacy Shield, or to a country which is not covered by an adequacy decision from the European Commission, we implement EU approved standard contractual clauses to ensure that your Personal Data is protected. You can request a copy of these standard contractual clauses by contacting us as set out in Section 6 below.

RETENTION & SECURITY
(a) DATA RETENTION
We retain personal data about our customers for as long as we believe is necessary for the purposes for which it was collected, or unless otherwise allowed or required by law. We collect Personal Data for a number of purposes (see above) and may be required to retain it for legal (including tax) reasons for a period which is longer than the time we need or use the data for the purpose of providing our rental services to you. We maintain a data retention policy to cover all the Personal Data we retain across our systems. If you have any questions about the retention period applying to the Personal Data we collect about you, please contact us (see Section 6).
(b) SECURITY MEASURES
Information is stored and accessed in various locations and cloud services. Servers which store information are primarily located in the United States and Europe, although storage may occur in other locations as well. We use reasonable administrative, technical, personnel, and physical measures (a) to safeguard Personal Data against loss, theft, unauthorized use, disclosure, or modification; and (b) to ensure the integrity of your Personal Data. To help us protect your privacy, you should maintain the secrecy of any logon IDs and passwords, Member numbers, or other identifiers or credentials you may have set up or were provided with in connection with your participation in or use of our products, services, or websites.
(c) TRANSMISSIONS
As you may be aware, there is no completely secure method of transmitting or storing data. Although their physical characteristics are different, postal mail, telephone calls, text messages, faxes and transmissions over the Internet or wireless networks all present possibilities of loss, misrouting, interception and misuse of the data that is transmitted. If you have reason to believe that any account with us is no longer secure, you must immediately contact us.
We try to strike a balance between the security of your data and your convenience. As a result, we may sometimes use a method of communication that is less secure than a less convenient alternative. For example, but not limitation, we may send you an e-mail or a text message in unencrypted form (i.e. instantly readable) because many of our customers are unable to access encrypted (i.e. coded) e-mail or messages. This means that our message, if misrouted or intercepted, could be read more easily than encrypted messages. Such messages may contain Personal Data. Please do not include confidential information, such as your credit card number or account passwords, in any e-mail or text you send to us or on any posting you make to a public area of a third-party social network page, especially since any such posting immediately becomes public. For a more secure way to communicate with us over the Internet, please click on the “Contact Us” link on any of our websites.
