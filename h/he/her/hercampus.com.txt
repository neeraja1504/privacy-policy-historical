Her Campus Media, LLC Privacy Policy
LAST UPDATED: September 3, 2019
This “Privacy Policy” describes how your Personal Information (defined below) is collected, used, and shared when you visit http://www.hercampus.com/, and our other websites, which currently include,  https://www.hercampusmedia.com/, https://www.herconference.com/, https://www.collegefashionweek.com/, https://www.influencehercollective.com/, https://www.thelala.com/, https://www.22under22.hercampus.com/, https://www.ourbodies.hercampus.com/, https://www.hercampus.design/, https://www.collegefashionista.com/, and https://herfuture.hercampus.com/ (each a “Site”, and collectively the “Sites”). The Sites are operated by Her Campus Media, LLC, and throughout this Privacy Policy, the terms “we”, “us” and “our” refer to Her Campus Media, LLC. By visiting the Sites or submitting “Personal Information” (defined below) to us, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and you expressly consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT
When you visit a Site, we automatically collect certain information including information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the “cookies” that are installed on the device through which you accessed the Site. Additionally, as you browse a Site, we collect information about the individual web pages that you view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and information about how you interact with the Site. We refer to this automatically-collected information as “Device Information”.
We collect Device Information using the following technologies:
- “Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or computer and often include an anonymous unique identifier. For more information about cookies, and how to disable cookies, visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org.
- “Log files” track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data including your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps.
- “Web beacons,” “tags,” and “pixels” are electronic files used to record information about how you browse the Site.
Additionally we may collect information that you voluntarily provide to us directly, when creating an account on the Site, subscribing to our newsletters, entering into a sweepstakes or contest, completing a survey or otherwise, such as your name, email address, phone number, age, gender, and other unique identifiers such as a user name and password. We refer to this information as “Account Information”.
When we talk about “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we are talking both about Device Information, Account Information, and any other information that may identify you.
HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
We use the Account Information that we collect generally to run the Sites, such as sending you updates and newsletters, responding to customer service requests, administering promotions and sweepstakes, and sending you our marketing communications.  We use Device Information that we collect to help us screen for potential risks and fraud, and more generally to improve and optimize our Sites (for example, by generating analytics about how our users browse and interact with each Site, and to assess the success of our marketing and advertising campaigns).
We may use information you provide us through emails, Q & A, blogs, comments, surveys, in response to polls, or through any other user-generated submission for editorial purposes (“UGC”), and may use your name and any stories you provide us in articles published online on any of our Sites. Please be advised that by publishing, uploading or otherwise submitting UGC to us, you automatically grant, and you represent and warrant that you have the right to grant, to us an irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive, transferable, fully paid, worldwide license to use, copy, publicly perform, publicly display, reformat, translate, excerpt (in whole or in part), transmit, and distribute such UGC for any purpose on or in connection with the Sites. If you provide us with personal anecdotes that include Personal Information, such anecdotes may be attributed to you. You agree that any UGC you send us will not violate any rights of any third party and that you will only send us UGC for which you own or control the rights.
SHARING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
We share your Personal Information with third parties who perform services on our behalf for the operation of the Site.  We also use Google Analytics to help us understand how our users use the Sites--you can read more about how Google uses your Personal Information here:  https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/.  You can also opt-out of Google Analytics here:  https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.
Some of our Sites may from time to time partner with a retailer or other third party to offer online shopping opportunities, games, services, subscriptions and other applications on a co-branded or cross-promotional basis (“Third Party Promotion(s)”). Those transactions may take place on one of the Sites, or the site of the party offering the Third Party Promotion. In either case, Personal Information you provide in connection with each Third Party Promotion may be shared with the applicable third party, as well as with any participating sponsors or advertisers of such opportunities and features.
You may have the option to create an account by logging in through a social media account or other third party service, such as Facebook or Instagram. If you do so, you give us permission to access, store and use any information that you permit the applicable third party website or service to share with us in accordance with their terms and conditions and policies. We may store and use any information that we receive from those websites and services in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  Our social media tools, such as the Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, Pinterest, and Snapchat widgets, are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Sites. Your activity with these tools is governed by the privacy policies of the companies that provide them.  If you give a third party service permission to share with us any of your Personal Information we may store and use any such Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
If another company acquires our company, business, or our assets, that company may then possess the Personal Information collected and stored by us, however, such company will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy. Finally, we may also share your Personal Information to comply with applicable laws and regulations, to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful request for information we receive, or to otherwise protect our rights.
DO NOT TRACK
Please note that we do not alter our Sites’ data collection and use practices when we see a Do Not Track signal from your browser.
CONSENT TO PROCESSING
Our Sites are operated in the United States of America. If you are located in the European Union, Canada or elsewhere outside of the United States, please be aware that Personal Information we collect will be transferred to and processed in the United States. By using a Site, or providing us with any Personal Information, you fully understand and unambiguously consent to this transfer, processing and storage of your Personal Information in the United States, a jurisdiction in which the privacy laws may not be as comprehensive as those in the country where you reside and/or are a citizen.
If you are an individual in the European Economic Area (EEA), we collect and process Personal Information about you only where we have legal basis for doing so under applicable EU laws.  The legal basis depends on the manner in which you use the Site. This means we collect and use your Personal Information only where:
We need it to provide you access and use of the Site, including to operate the Site, provide customer support and personalized features and to protect the safety and security of the Site;
It satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as for research and development, to market and promote our Site and to protect our legal rights and interests;
You give us consent to do so for a specific purpose; or
We need to process your Personal Information to comply with a legal obligation.
If you have consented to our use of Personal Information for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place.  Where we are using your Personal Information because we or a third party have a legitimate interest to do so, you have the right to object to that use, though, in some cases, this may mean no longer using the Site.
By using a Site you understand that your Personal Information may be transferred to countries outside of your country of residence, including the United States, which may have data protection rules that are different from those of your country.  In certain circumstances, courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security authorities in those other countries may be entitled to access your Personal Information.
We are the controller of information that you provide in order for us to provide the Site for your use.  You are the controller of any information that is entered during and as part of your use of the Site and we are the processor of that information on your behalf.  We will process the information according to your instructions, which you give us in the process of using the Site.
If you reside in the EEA and we do not seek your explicit consent to process your Personal Information, we are relying on the legitimate commercial interest of our company in providing the Site to you and other customers and the need to process your Personal Information, as previously described, in order to accomplish that legitimate interest. Where data processing is occurring based on the basis of your consent, you also have the right to withdraw consent and request that we halt processing at any time. This withdrawal of consent does not invalidate the consent-based processing that occurred prior to withdrawal.
DATA RETENTION
We will maintain your Personal Information for as long as needed in order to perform the purposes for which such Personal Information was collected.  You may request at any time to access or update your Personal Information, or that we delete any of your Personal Information stored by us, by contacting us at [email protected].  Following any such request, we will take all reasonable steps to provide, modify or delete your Personal Information as soon as is practicable, but some information may remain in archived/backup copies for our records or as otherwise required by law.
SECURITY
The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
MINORS
The Sites are not intended for use by children.  No one under the age of 13 is permitted to access the Sites or provide any Personal Information. By using any of the Sites, you represent that you are at least the age of majority in your state or province of residence, or that you are the age of majority in your state or province of residence and you have given us your consent to allow any of you minor dependents to use the Sites.
We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with Personal Information, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Information from children under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, we will remove that information from our servers.
CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS
California residents may request certain information regarding our disclosure of Personal Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes, and those who have an established business relationship with us may also choose to opt-out from such disclosures. To do so, please contact us at [email protected] stating your specific request and your name, address, e-mail address and phone number. Please allow a minimum of 30 days for a response. This will not prohibit disclosure of information for non-marketing purposes.
If you are a California resident under the age of 18, and a registered user of any Site where this policy is posted, California Business and Professions Code Section 22581 permits you to request and obtain removal of content or information you have publicly posted. To make such a request, please send an email with a detailed description of the specific content or information to [email protected]. Please be aware that such a request does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or information you have posted and that there may be circumstances in which the law does not require or allow removal even if requested.
CHANGES
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to our practices or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons. As such, we encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices. However, we will not use your Personal Information in a way that is materially different from the uses described in this Privacy Policy without giving you an opportunity to opt-out of such differing uses. If we make a material change to the way in which we collect, use, and/or share your Personal Information, we will send an email to users who have provided an email address and/or change the “Last Updated” date at the top of this Privacy Policy.
