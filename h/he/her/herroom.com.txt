Andra Group L.P. – the owner of HerRoom.com, HisRoom.com, and TheUndies.com -has created this privacy statement because we believe you have a right to a safe, secure online shopping experience. We are committed both to protecting your privacy and informing you how information from you will be used. If you still have concerns or questions after reading this policy, please contact us.
When I visit an Andra Group L.P. website, what information is gathered about me and why?
Andra Group L.P. does collect certain customer information. We use this information to process orders, enhance your shopping experience and communicate with our customers.
We use order forms that allow you to buy our products. We collect your name, e-mail address, postal address, and credit card information. This information is used to process and send orders. We also use this information to contact you in case there is a question or problem with an order.
When you enter a contest or other promotional feature, we may collect your name, e-mail address, and other demographic information, such as zip code, age, or income level. We use this contact information to send you information about our company and to contact you, if necessary.
We also use data collected when you register, enter a contest, and make purchases to enhance and personalize your shopping experience. We may also send you email about updates and product offerings. You can unsubscribe to these emails at any time.
We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer this website. We log IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to track a user's specific session, or to investigate cases of fraud or other security violations on our site. Any personally identifiable information contained in our IP address logs will be treated with the same respect for your privacy that order and registration information is treated.
What the heck are cookies and should I worry about them?
Cookies are small pieces of information that most web sites use to make online navigation easier. This data is contained on your hard drive in a file which your web browser provides for the purpose. A cookie can contain information such as a user ID. Our site can't read other data on your hard drive or read cookies created by other sites.
Our site uses cookies to keep track of your shopping bag and, if you choose to register with us or request to receive email from us, to deliver content specific to your interests. You do not need to have cookies turned on to view our site, but you will need to accept cookies to register or order products.
Who else has access to the information I provide to HerRoom?
Andra Group L.P. does not sell, rent, or give away your personal information to anyone. We do supply information for the purpose of billing and shipping your order. In other words, we do get approval from the credit card company and do give the shipper your address. The other form of third party information that may be used is personally identifiable information submitted for another person by you. For instance, if you want to buy a gift for a friend and have it shipped to them; or, if you complete a "tell a friend" form on our site. Also, we may release account information when we believe, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to 1) comply with the law, 2) enforce or apply the terms of any of our user agreements or 3) protect the rights, property, or safety of Andra Group L.P. and our users, or others.
How do I manage how much information I share or if I share any at all?
You can opt out of receiving e-mail and other communications from us. You can also update and/or correct any information about yourself that you've provided to Andra Group L.P.. Just contact us using any of the ways listed at the top of this page.
What is Andra Group L.P. doing to protect my privacy?
This site has security measures in place to protect from the loss, misuse, and alteration of information under our control. Our servers use encrypted methods for those pages which contain personally identifiable data, including your credit card and address. We routinely and zealously monitor and upgrade our security systems to ensure that we use the best security technology available.
We at Andra Group L.P. are sincerely committed to a safe and secure web experience for our visitors. If, after reading all this, you have concerns or questions, by all means, get in touch with us.

Thus, anything you submit, post, or deliver to Andra Group L.P. will be treated as nonconfidential and nonproprietary, and we shall have the royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable and transferable right to use, copy, distribute, display, publish, perform, sell, lease, transmit, adapt, create derivative works from such Submissions by any means and in any form, and to translate, modify, reverse-engineer, disassemble, or decompile such Submissions.
