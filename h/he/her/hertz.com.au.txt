Privacy Policy
YOUR PRIVACY
We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting the personal data we hold about you. This policy explains what data we collect about you, how we collect it, the measures we take in our efforts to keep your data secure and the uses and disclosures we make of it.  We also explain the options you have in relation to your personal data.
When you request services from us, operate a vehicle or equipment with in-vehicle or in-equipment technology, access our websites, utilize our mobile “apps” or otherwise interact with us, for example, but without limitation, through our kiosks, our official corporate pages on third party social networks (such as Facebook) or the “apps” on those pages, you consent to our collection, retention and use of your personal data in the manner described in this policy and accept the risks outlined in the Security section.
SCOPE
This policy covers the personal data we collect about you in connection with our vehicle and equipment rental business which identifies you as an individual.   It does not apply to data that does not personally identify you as an individual, for example, but without limitation, aggregated anonymous data, IP addresses,  computer operating systems,  personal preferences, vehicle identification numbers, etc.   We are free to use data that does not identify you as an individual as we wish.  This policy does not apply to data collected by third party social networks (such as Facebook), mobile device manufacturers, third party “mobile apps”, wireless service providers, internet service providers or the operators of any networks through which you may interact with us and we expressly disclaim any responsibility for the data collection, privacy or data security practices of those entities.  With regard to pages on third party social networks, this policy only applies to personal data we collect through our pages (those with a direct link to this policy) and does not apply to any “unofficial” pages or pages of our affiliates or licensees.  Our websites are not directed to individuals under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly obtain personal data from such individuals.
Who We Are **
** --------------------------------------------------------
We are The Hertz Corporation, a U.S. company, which, together with our subsidiary companies, provides and supports vehicle and equipment rental services worldwide.  All references in this policy to “we”, “us” and “our” are to us and our subsidiaries.  Our businesses generally operate under a “Hertz” mark, including Hertz Rent A Car, Hertz Local Edition, Hertz 24/7 (formerly known as either "Connect by Hertz" or "Hertz on Demand"), Hertz Claims Management, and Hertz Equipment Rental Corporation.  In addition, our subsidiary Navigation Solutions, LLC, which provides the Hertz NeverLost service, is also covered by this policy.  However, neither our Dollar Rent A Car or Thrifty Rent A Car businesses operated by Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group, Inc., a Hertz subsidiary, our Firefly Rent A Car business, nor our Donlen Corporation subsidiary are covered by this policy because each of those entities/operations has its own privacy policy that is applicable to its operations. We also operate equipment rental businesses and, to a lesser extent, vehicle and equipment sales, and claims administration businesses.
We operate a network of licensees in provision of our services worldwide and are affiliated to many other companies through ownership. As our licensees and affiliates are independent companies, they are not owned or controlled by us and are not covered by this policy, although they may have their own privacy policies to govern the personal data they collect. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of our licensees and affiliates.
** More about subsidiaries, licensees and affiliates** …
** Subsidiaries:** These companies are owned by The Hertz Corporation and are covered by this policy. The expressions “we”, “us” and “our” apply to them, except for   Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group, Inc. which operates the   Dollar Rent A Car   and Thrifty Rent A Car businesses, Firefly Rent A Car, LLC, and Donlen Corporation which operates a fleet leasing and fleet management business.
** Licensees:** We have a network of independent companies licensed to operate vehicle or equipment rental businesses using the “Hertz” name and business system.  These companies may describe themselves as “Hertz System Licensees” or “Hertz Franchisees” to indicate that they are not our subsidiaries.
** Affiliates:** These companies either control us (through ownership) or are controlled by the companies that control us. They cover a range of businesses but are generally not involved in provision of our services to you. _ _

COLLECTION
We collect a range of data about you from a variety of sources for the purposes of our business. The examples we provide here are illustrative rather than a complete list of our practices.
What We Collect
--------------------------------------------------------

Data about your health conditions is regarded as sensitive in many countries. If you ask us to accommodate a disability, such as by provision of hand controls, or if there is an accident and we need to work with insurance and claims management companies relating to any injury you may incur, we may need to process data about your health conditions.  Similarly, in the EU, at least, your membership of a trade union or similar organization is regarded as sensitive and we may need to process this information if you use a CDP Number that only members of that union or organization can use.
Please note that if you wish to rent with us or our licensees and need to provide sensitive data, you consent to that data being collected, used, retained and disclosed for our Operational Uses. We will not use sensitive data about you for marketing purposes.

Certain technologies are used on our websites and on mobile devices to collect data about your visit or usage, as follows:

A “ cookie ” is a set of data sent to your computer or mobile device by a web server that enables the server to recognize your computer or mobile device.
Cookies help improve the quality of your visits to websites, for example, but not limitation, by making the reservation process faster and smoother. The information the cookies provide helps in the development of content and features that may be of interest to you.
We use cookies to:
Track your use of our websites during a single visit, remember the data you provide and the choices you make as you progress from page to page (“ session cookies ”); and

• If you restrict our use of persistent cookies you may still enjoy the full workings of our websites and e-mail messages but will need to re-enter some data when starting a new website session. Although persistent cookies will neither automatically be erased nor made unavailable to us upon closing your browser, they will typically “expire” after a number of years.
If you are still unsure about cookies, please note that   our cookies are unable to retrieve other data from your computer’s hard drive or pass on computer viruses.
Pixel Tags
In addition, “ pixel tags ”, “web beacons”, “JavaScript”, or similar technologies that enable, among other things, the tracking of your actions as a user of various websites or recipient of e-mail messages. (“Pixel Tags”) may be used. Pixel Tags may be used in connection with our web pages, our online advertising, or our e-mail messages, either by Hertz or by our service providers, business partners or other third parties.
Pixel Tags are used to collect typically anonymous data to help identify types of information, including popular destinations, average rental prices, quote and conversion rates, click-throughs and other information to improve the service you receive or the relevance of advertising directed to you. Pixel Tags may also be used to identify which online advertisement or email has brought you to a website.
Further, certain Pixel Tags may be used by other companies for the purpose of tracking visits to their websites, identifying if such internet traffic came from a Hertz website or confirming your eligibility to receive services or benefits from such other companies.
Third party cookies or Pixel Tags may collect information about a user of our site’s online activities over time and across different web sites.
Some of our web sites may use Google Analytics, which uses cookies and other, similar technologies (e.g. Pixel Tags) to collect information about website use anonymously and reports trends, without identifying individual visitors.  To learn more about Google Analytics, including how to opt out of it, visit https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.
We use third-party advertising companies to serve advertisements regarding goods and services that may be of interest to you when you access and use our websites and other websites, based on information relating to your access to and use of our websites and other websites.  To do so, these companies may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser (including through the use of Pixel Tags).  If you would like to learn more about this practice, including your choices with respect to it, please visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp and http://www.aboutads.info/.
We do not respond to a web browser’s “do not track” signal, or other mechanism that indicates a request to disable online tracking of individuals who use or visit our websites.
As the internet and other eCommerce channels continue to develop, we may deploy and utilize different types of technologies to collect data regarding your visit or usage.
Blogs or Message Boards
Some of our websites and our official corporate pages on third party social networks (such as Facebook) may provide functionality that permits you to post public messages or responses to articles, comments or other postings.  You should be aware that by submitting such a posting, including any personal data or non-personal data in connection with it, you intend for that posting and any data in connection with it to be, and it shall immediately become, public and as such will not be subject to this Privacy Policy. We reserve the right to remove any posting or content in a posting at our sole discretion.
Other Company Websites
Our websites and e-mail messages may contain links to websites operated by other companies.  You should be aware that the collection, retention and use of any data you provide on these websites will be governed by the privacy policy of the company providing the website and not by this policy.
RETENTION
We try to ensure that the personal data we retain about you is stored securely and, in light of the information provided to us, is as accurate, current,  complete and relevant as necessary for the purposes for which we use and disclose it.
Storage
--------------------------------------------------------
We generally retain personal data about our customers for as long as we believe appropriate for the purposes for which it was collected or as otherwise required or authorized by applicable law.
Our principal databases for storing the personal data we collect are located in Oklahoma, U.S.A., except for the Hertz 24/7 database, which is principally located in France and the Navigation Solutions, LLC database, which is principally located in Texas, U.S.A.
Security
--------------------------------------------------------
As you may be aware, there is no completely secure method of transmitting or storing data. Although their physical characteristics are different, postal mail, telephone calls, text messages, faxes and transmissions over the Internet or wireless networks all present possibilities of loss, misrouting, interception and misuse of the data that is transmitted.
We take commercially reasonable measures to protect against the loss, misuse and unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration and destruction of your personal data by aiming to maintain appropriate physical, procedural and electronic safeguards to protect your personal data, including:
Restricting access to personal data to our employees or service providers on a “need to know” basis;
Enforcing policies and procedures for our employees in their handling of personal data; and
Using technologies designed to safeguard data during its transmission, such as SSL encryption for the data you provide on our websites.
If you have reason to believe that any account with us is no longer secure, you must immediately contact us by following the instructions at the end of this policy.
** More about ** _ _ ** SSL encryption…**
“SSL” stands for Secure Sockets Layer encryption. We use this protection when you submit personal data to us on our websites.   SSL encryption seeks to ensure that you are actually sending your data to us and that no-one else can read or tamper with it during transmission.
When you are asked to provide your personal data to us on our website, you will see that our “http” website address changes to read "https". The additional “s” denotes that the site is secure for that data transfer. You may also see a closed padlock symbol on your screen, again denoting a secure site.
Security of Communications
We try to strike a balance between the security of your data and your convenience.  As a result, we may sometimes use a method of communication that is less secure than a less convenient alternative.
For example, but not limitation, we will send you an e-mail or a text message in unencrypted form (i.e. instantly readable) because many of our customers are unable to access encrypted (i.e. coded) e-mail or messages. This means that our message, if misrouted or intercepted, could be read more easily than encrypted messages. For this reason, please do not include confidential information, such as your credit card number or account passwords, in any e-mail or text you send to us or on any posting you make to a public area of a third party social network page, especially since any such posting immediately becomes public.
For a more secure way to communicate with us over the Internet, please click on the “ Contact Us ” link on any page of www.hertz.com, www.hertz247.com, or www.hertzequip.com, or initiate a Live Chat session via www.neverlost.com, and follow our instructions.
Access and Correction
--------------------------------------------------------
You may access and review your personal data, change it and correct factual errors as follows:
If you are a member of a Hertz membership program, such as Hertz Gold Plus Rewards, or similar program, you may update your member profile by logging into the Hertz Gold Plus Rewards section of  www.hertz.com.

To protect your privacy and the security of your personal data, we will take steps to verify your identity before granting you access or making corrections to the data we store about you.
Certain types of personal data may need to be updated with the third party social network through which you may interact with us, rather than directly with us.

Non-members
We may record your privacy election regarding the receipt of marketing communications at the time you make a reservation or at other times when you interact with us.  If you are not then a member of one of our membership programs, or the email address provided for the specific reservation/interaction is not associated with the profile you have in a membership program, you can follow the “Alternate opportunities to opt-out” instructions below to tell us that you no longer wish to receive marketing communications at that email address if you previously had elected to receive marketing communications.
In addition, if you are not a member of one of our membership programs, you can record your marketing choices by enrolling, free of charge, in Hertz Gold Plus Rewards. Please either ask at the rental counter or visit our Hertz Gold Plus Rewards section at  www.hertz.com.
When you enroll, we will provide you with a Hertz Gold Plus Rewards member number and ask you to quote it when you rent a vehicle from Hertz.  We will automatically apply your marketing choices to all Hertz rentals you make quoting this number. Your choices will be recorded in your Hertz Gold Plus Rewards Profile and you will be able to amend your choices at any time by following the instructions for Members of Hertz membership programs above.
Alternative opportunities to opt-out
Our marketing emails contain an unsubscribe option.  If you do not want us to continue to send marketing emails to your email address, click on ‘ unsubscribe ’ and we will not send further marketing emails to that address, although you may still receive emails at other addresses for which you have not unsubscribed. If you subsequently wish to override your choice to unsubscribe, you will need to either amend your Profile (see Members of Hertz membership programs ) or, if you are not a member of one of our programs, follow the instructions for Non-members above, or at Contact Us below.
Important points to note
Please note the following points about the marketing choices you make:
If you change your marketing choices, we will observe your most recent choice with regard to the contact information associated with your membership number for the relevant membership program.  To the extent allowed by law, marketing choices you make with regard to one membership program will not modify your marketing choices for another membership program.  Although we aim to process your choices promptly, you may still receive marketing communications prepared before we received your request to unsubscribe;
If you change your address, we will continue to follow your directions for your most recent address provided from your ‘unsubscribe’ click noted above, your Profile, or the My Privacy Choices form you completed that is associated with you for the implicated membership program. In order for us to continue to follow your directions at a new address, you will need to update your Profile online or complete another My Privacy Choices form with your updated information and provide it to us with your changed contact information; and
If you choose not to receive marketing messages from us, you may not be able to receive certain benefits connected to any program to which you belong, such as promotions involving Hertz Gold Plus Rewards points and free rental days (if applicable). You will, however, to the extent permitted by law, continue to receive applicable program updates and other membership information; and
If your Profile contains a customer discount program (CDP) number or you enrolled for Hertz 24/7 with a Promotion Code (PC) or through an affiliation, your CDP, PC or affiliation sponsor may have made marketing choices for users of that CDP, PC or affiliation.  If the sponsor’s choices are more restrictive on our use of your data than your choices, we will observe the choices made by the sponsor in connection with those transactions in which such CDP, PC or affiliation is used.
