How does HelloDirect.com make sure my order information is secure?
The safety of your credit card information is important to us, and Hello Direct has taken measures to protect the security of your online order information.
Hello Direct uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to keep your online order information safe. SSL technology encrypts your credit card number, order information and personal information before it is transmitted to protect it from being decoded by anyone other than Hello Direct. Our site also displays the VeriSign Secure Site Seal, which indicates that the site has been authenticated by VeriSign and that confidential transactions with the site are secured by SSL encryption.
Once you enter the checkout page, your computer will begin communicating with our server in secure mode. You can determine the security of your connection by looking at the bottom of your internet browser window after you have accessed our website-SSL technology is active if there is a solid key or a closed lock. You can also double-check by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https".
Some versions of browsers and some firewalls don't permit communication through secure servers like the ones we use to process orders at HelloDirect.com. If you cannot access the secure server for any reason, you can place your order by calling 1-800-HELLO34.
While we implement the above and other security measures to protect your information, please note that no data transmitted over the internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
