Once you register with Helium and sign into our services, you are not anonymous to us.

This information will be collected, stored, accessed and processed in a secure manner. Helium automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, Helium cookie information (if any), and the page you request.

Security
The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
Helium limits access to personal information about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs. We have physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to protect personal information about you. Your Helium Account Information is password-protected. In certain areas, Helium uses industry-standard SSL encryption to protect data transmissions.
Data you provide to us will be stored on our servers located in the United States. By providing us with your information, you understand and consent to the international transfer of your data to the United States.
No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, can be 100% secure. Therefore, Helium cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information. The Internet by its nature is a public forum, and Helium encourages you to use caution when disclosing information online. Often, you are in the best situation to protect yourself online. You are responsible for protecting your username and password from third party access, and for selecting passwords that are secure.
Monitoring and Enforcement
Helium regularly reviews our compliance with our privacy policy. We also adhere to several self-regulatory frameworks in addition to complying with applicable law. If we receive formal written complaints, we will follow up with the person making the complaint. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities to resolve any complaints that cannot be resolved directly.
Compliance
Helium adheres to applicable US federal and state personal information privacy laws and international regulations such as PIPEDA, the European Union (“EU”) Data Protection (95/46/EC) and ePrivacy (2002/58/ED) Directives (as transposed into national law), and the EU Safe Harbor Privacy Principles published by the US Department of Commerce (“Safe Harbor”), detailed below.
PIPEDA (Canada)
Helium recognizes and has controls in place to ensure that the privacy of personal information about an “identifiable individual” used in the course of “commercial activity” is protected and managed in such a manner which meets or exceeds the guidelines set out in PIPEDA and applicable provincial legislation.
Safe Harbor (European Union)
Through your use of this system, you acknowledge that you are transmitting your information to systems housed in the United States.
As a subsidiary of RR Donnelley, Helium recognizes that the EU has an “omnibus” information protection regime established pursuant to the European Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC) (the “Directive”).  RR Donnelley has signed up to the US Department of Commerce’s Safe Harbor program and gives “adequate protection” for personal information of EU citizens processed and stored in the United States.   RR Donnelley takes appropriate technical and organizational measures to safeguard EU Personal Information against unauthorized or unlawful processing of, or accidental loss, damage, misuse, unauthorized access, unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized alteration, or destruction, and maintains reasonable procedures to help ensure that such information is relevant for its intended use, accurate, complete, current and not excessive and that such information is not retained longer than is reasonably necessary.
RR Donnelley may disclose EU Personal Information as necessary in connection with the sale or transfer of all or part of its business, where required or permitted by law, where RR Donnelley believes that such disclosures are appropriate in connection with a law enforcement request or as otherwise permitted by Safe Harbor, or in order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities or suspected fraud or in order to comply with, enforce or apply RR Donnelley agreements.
