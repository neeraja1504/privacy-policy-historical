Last revised and effective as of: June 28, 2015
Your privacy is extremely important to us.

To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on every page of this website.

As used in this Privacy Policy, the terms "using" and "processing" information include using cookies on a computer, subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using or handling information in any way, including, but not limited to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring information within our organization.

What information does Help Scout collect?
Depending on your use of the Help Scout Service, we collect two types of information: personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information.
Personally Identifiable Information
Personally identifiable information identifies you or can be used to identify or contact you. Examples of personally identifiable information include your name, company name, job title, address, e-mail address, telephone number, and billing and credit card information.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information
Non-personally identifiable information is information, any single of item of which, by itself, cannot be used to identify or contact you, including demographic information (such as age, profession, company industry, gender, current location, or zip code), IP addresses, browser types, domain names, and statistical data involving the use of the Help Scout Service. Certain non-personally identifiable information may be considered a part of your personally identifiable information if it were combined with other identifiers (for example, combining your zip code with your street address) in a way that enables you to be identified. But the same pieces of information are considered non-personally identifiable information when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-personally identifiable information (for example, your account preferences).
