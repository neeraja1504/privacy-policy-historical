Privacy Policy | HelloProfit
Section A: Overview
1. The reason for this policy
This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their ‘Personally identifiable information’ (PII) also known as ‘Personal Data’ is being used online. PII, as used in US privacy law and information security, is
information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. United States privacy laws apply to all persons outside of the European Union, whether
or not said persons are residents or citizens of the United States and its outlying territories. The European (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies to all EU residents and citizens effective as of May 25th, 2018.
Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our website.
You have legal rights with regard to the way your personal data is handled. Depending on your citizenship and residency, you may be subject to legal rights under the scope of European or United States applicable law.
You have the right to complain under Article 77 of the GDPR to the supervisory authority of Company.
In the course of our business activities we collect, store and process personal data about our customers, suppliers and other third parties, and therefore in order to comply with the law and to maintain confidence in our business, we acknowledge the
importance of correct and lawful treatment of this data.
All people working in or with our business are obliged to comply with this policy when processing personal data.
2. Introduction
This policy and any other documents referred to in it sets out the basis on which we will process any personal data we collect from data subjects, for example, customers and business contacts, or that is provided to us by data subjects or other sources.
It also sets out our obligations in relation to data protection under the European General Data Protection Regulation (“the Regulation” or “GDPR”) as well as under the United States Privacy Act of 1974.
This policy sets out rules on data protection and the legal conditions that must be satisfied when we obtain, handle, process, transfer and store personal data.
The procedures and principles set out herein must be followed at all times by us and our employees, agents, contractors, or other parties working on behalf of the Company.
We aim to ensure the correct, lawful, and fair handling of your personal data and to respect your legal rights.
3. The meaning of key Data Protection terms
Data is information which is stored electronically, on a computer, or in certain paper-based filing systems.
Data subjects for the purpose of this policy include all living individuals about whom we holds personal data. A data subject need not be a UK national or resident. All data subjects have legal rights in relation to their personal
information.
Personal data means data relating to a living individual who can be identified from that data (or from that data and other information in our possession). Personal data can be factual (for example, a name, address or date of birth)
or it can be an opinion about that person, their actions and behaviour.
Data controllers are the people who or organizations which determine the purposes for which, and the manner in which, any personal data is processed. They are responsible for establishing practices and policies in line with the Act.
We are the data controller and data processor of personal data used in our business for our own commercial purposes.
Processing is any activity that involves use of the data. It includes obtaining, recording or holding the data, or carrying out any operation or set of operations on the data including organising, amending, retrieving, using, disclosing,
erasing or destroying it. Processing also includes transferring personal data to third parties.
4. Summary of the Data Protection Principles
This Policy aims to ensure compliance with the Regulation and United States privacy laws. The Regulation sets out the following principles with which any party handling personal data must comply. All personal data must be:
(Processed fairly and lawfully) processed lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject;
(Processed for limited purposes and in an appropriate way) collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes; further processing for archiving

(Adequate, relevant and not excessive for the purpose) adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which it is processed;
(Accurate) accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that is inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, is erased or rectified without
delay;
(Not kept longer than necessary for the purpose) kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data is processed; personal data may be stored for
longer periods insofar as the personal data will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes subject to implementation of the appropriate technical and organizational
measures required by the Regulation in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject;
(Processing in line with data subject’s rights) personal data must be processed in line with data subjects’ rights, in particular your right to:
request access to any data held about them by a Data Controller.
prevent the processing of their data for direct-marketing purposes.
ask to have inaccurate data amended.
prevent processing that is likely to cause damage or distress to themselves or anyone else.

Section B: Data Protection Principles
1. Lawful, Fair, and Transparent Data Processing
The Regulation is not intended to prevent the processing of personal data, but to ensure that it is done fairly and without adversely affecting the rights of the data subject. The processing of personal data is lawful if one (or more) of the following
applies:
(consent) the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes;

(legal obligation) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Data Controller is subject;
(protection) processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person;
(public interest) processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the Data Controller;
(legitimate interests) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Data Controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the fundamental rights and freedoms of the
data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.
2. Processed for Specified, Explicit and Legitimate Purposes
The Company collects and processes the personal data set out in Schedule 1 of this Policy. This may include personal data received directly from data subjects (for example, contact details used when a data subject communicates with us) and can include
data received from third parties though this is not our intention, as laid out in this Policy.
The Company only processes personal data for the specific purposes set out in Schedule 1 of this Policy (or for other purposes expressly permitted by the Regulation). The purposes for which we process personal data will be informed to data subjects
at the time that their personal data is collected, where it is collected directly from them, or as soon as possible (not more than one calendar month) after collection where it is obtained from a third party.
3. Adequate, Relevant and Limited Data Processing
The Company will only collect and process personal data for and to the extent necessary for the specific purpose(s) informed to data subjects as under Part 5, above.

any inaccurate or out-of-date data is found, all reasonable steps will be taken without delay to amend or erase that data, as appropriate.
5. Timely Processing
The Company shall not keep personal data for any longer than is necessary in light of the purposes for which that data was originally collected and processed. When the data is no longer required or there is no foreseeable use for such data in future or
upon the explicit request of the User to erase said personal data, all reasonable steps will be taken to erase it without delay.
6. Secure Processing
The Company shall ensure that all personal data collected and processed is kept secure and protected against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage. Further details of the data protection and organizational

Where the personal data is not obtained from the data subject directly (i.e. from another party such as Google):
If the personal data is used to communicate with the data subject, at the time of the first communication; or
If the personal data is to be disclosed to another party, before the personal data is disclosed; or
at the time when the data subject is made aware of the exchange of data, such as when visiting Company’s website and agreeing to the use of tracking cookies.
3. Data Subject Access
A data subject may make a subject access request (“SAR”) at any time to find out more about the personal data which the Company holds about them. The Company is normally required to respond to SARs within one month of receipt (this can
be extended in the case of complex and/or numerous requests, and in such cases the data subject shall be informed of the need for the extension).
All subject access requests received must be forwarded to Nakisha Muhammad, the Company’s data protection officer, at support[at]helloprofit.com.
The Company does not charge a fee for the handling of normal SARs. The Company reserves the right to charge reasonable fees for additional copies of information that has already been supplied to a data subject, and for requests that are manifestly
unfounded or excessive, particularly where such requests are repetitive.
SARs and personal data made portable will be made available in widely acceptable formats, such as .jpg, .png, .pdf and .xlsx.
4. Rectification of Personal Data
If a data subject informs the Company that personal data held by the Company is inaccurate or incomplete, requesting that it be rectified, the personal data in question shall be rectified, and the data subject informed of that rectification within
a reasonable amount of time after receipt of the data subject’s notice (this can be extended by up to two months in the case of complex requests, and in such cases the data subject shall be informed of the need for the extension).
In the event that any affected personal data has been disclosed to third parties, those parties shall be informed of any rectification of that personal data.
5. Erasure of Personal Data
Data subjects may request that the Company erases the personal data it holds about them in the following circumstances:
It is no longer necessary for the Company to hold that personal data with respect to the purpose for which it was originally collected or processed;
The data subject wishes to withdraw their consent to the Company holding and processing their personal data;
The data subject objects to the Company holding and processing their personal data (and there is no overriding legitimate interest to allow the Company to continue doing so);
The personal data has been processed unlawfully;
The personal data needs to be erased in order for the Company to comply with a particular legal obligation.
Unless the Company has reasonable grounds to refuse to erase personal data, all requests for erasure shall be complied with, and the data subject informed of the erasure within a reasonable amount of time after the receipt of the data subject’s
request (this can be extended by up to two months in the case of complex requests, and in such cases the data subject shall be informed of the need for the extension).
In the event that any personal data that is to be erased in response to a data subject request has been disclosed to third parties, those parties shall be informed of the erasure (unless it is impossible or would require disproportionate effort to
do so).
6. Restriction of Personal Data Processing
Data subjects may request that the Company ceases processing the personal data it holds about them. If a data subject makes such a request, the Company shall retain only the amount of personal data pertaining to that data subject that is necessary
to ensure that no further processing of their personal data takes place.
In the event that any affected personal data has been disclosed to third parties, those parties shall be informed of the applicable restrictions on processing it (unless it is impossible or would require disproportionate effort to do so).
7. Data Portability
The Company processes personal data using automated means. This includes, but is not limited to, gathering the data subject’s name, contact information and billing information via the third party billing service Stripe for means of processing the
data subject’s subscription payments.
Where data subjects have given their consent to the Company to process their personal data in such a manner or the processing is otherwise required for the performance of a contract between the Company and the data subject, data subjects have the
legal right under the Regulation to receive a copy of their personal data and to use it for other purposes (namely transmitting it to other Data Controllers, e.g. other organizations).
To facilitate the right of data portability, the Company shall make available all applicable personal data to data subjects in the widely accessible formats listed previously.
All requests for copies of personal data shall be complied with within a reasonable amount of time upon receipt of the data subject’s request (this can be extended by up to two months in the case of complex requests in the case of complex or
numerous requests, and in such cases the data subject shall be informed of the need for the extension).
8. Objections to Personal Data Processing
Data subjects have the right to object to the Company processing their personal data based on legitimate interests (including profiling) and direct marketing (including profiling).
Where a data subject objects to the Company processing their personal data based on its legitimate interests, the Company shall cease such processing forthwith, unless it can be demonstrated that the Company’s legitimate grounds for such processing
override the data subject’s interests, rights and freedoms; or the processing is necessary for the conduct of legal claims.
Where a data subject objects to the Company processing their personal data for direct marketing purposes, the Company shall cease such processing forthwith.
However, in the event that a data subject does submit such an objection and wishes to maintain his or her subscription of Company’s services, then the Company reserves the necessary right to contact said data subject regarding billing, services, changes
to services and terms, and other matters strictly regarding the contractual agreement of both parties for Company to offer services to the data subject.
Where a data subject objects to the Company processing their personal data for scientific and/or historical research and statistics purposes, the data subject must, under the Regulation, ‘demonstrate grounds relating to his or her particular
situation’. The Company is not required to comply if the research is necessary for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest.
9. Profiling
Where the Company uses personal data and not anonymously rendered personal data such as Facebook tracking cookies for profiling purposes, the following shall apply:
Clear information explaining the profiling will be provided, including its significance and the likely consequences;
Appropriate mathematical or statistical procedures will be used;
Technical and organizational measures necessary to minimise the risk of errors and to enable such errors to be easily corrected shall be implemented; and

laws).

being shared, and to comply with this policy.

Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children’s privacy and safety online.
We do not specifically market to children under 13. Neither do we intend to market to children under the age of 18.
