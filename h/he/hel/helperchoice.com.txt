It may be possible that we need to disclose personal information, profile information, job ads or information about your activities at the HelperChoice website when required by law, subpoena or other legal processes globally. We will only do this if we have good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to investigate, prevent or act against suspected or actual illegal activities (such as scamming, and online abuse) or to assist government enforcement agencies. We exercise the right to protect the rights and safety of HelperChoice, our members and others.
13.6. Security
HelperChoice takes precautions including technical, administrative, and physical measures to safeguard your information against loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Access to our database is limited to HelperChoice only, and we take all reasonable measures to ensure that your information is correct and securely maintained. We communicate these guidelines to all employees and strictly enforce privacy safeguards within our company. To protect any data stored on our servers, we regularly check and monitor our system for possible vulnerabilities and attacks. However, since the internet is not always secure, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you submit to us. We expect you to protect the security of login information so that others cannot access your account. We strongly advise you to be careful with confidential information and to never pay anyone through our website. If we suspect anyone of online abuse or scamming, we will delete their accounts per our Terms and Conditions.
