Any personal information provided to us through our website is collected, used and disclosed in accordance with the British Columbia  Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act  and other applicable legislation. What is considered Personal Information under the British Columbia  Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act? Under the British Columbia  Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act , personal information includes recorded information about an identifiable individual, such as name, address, phone number, e-mail address and credit card information.

What Personal Information We Collect and How We Use It
When someone visits one of our websites, our web server automatically collects a limited amount of standard information essential to the operation, security and evaluation of the Destination British Columbia website. This information helps us to make our site more useful to visitors and includes the:
Internet domain and Internet Protocol (IP) address from computers that access our website,
type of browser and operating system used to access our site,
date and time our site is accessed,
pages visited,
address of any websites linked to, and
content downloaded from our site.
While some of this information does not identify who people are, other information (e.g. Internet domain names or the IP addresses of internet service providers) may provide identification. The extent of personal identification depends on the naming standards followed by the internet service provider. You may wish to check with your provider to inquire about their policies and practices in this regard. Destination British Columbia does not use this information to identify individuals who visit our website unless required to do so as part of an internal investigation or other law enforcement purpose.
Any personal information collected via our website (e.g. web forms) is done in compliance with BC’s privacy legislation and is considered necessary for providing services offered by our organization. There is always an option of whether or not to provide us with personal information. Your decision not to participate in electronic service delivery activities will not impair your ability to browse our website. However, it may limit the use of certain website features. The personal information provided to us is used for the purpose for which it was collected or for a use consistent with that purpose. For example, personal information may be used to: send information about British Columbia that we believe will be of interest (based on a confidential personal profile); contact about upcoming vacation opportunities; respond to inquiries; provide requested materials; obtain feedback on vacation experiences; or assist with the use of our website. In most cases, we try to obtain explicit consent before these activities will occur. At any time, anyone may request that we stop communicating by either updating their user profile or contacting us directly.
Storage, Access and Disclosure of Your Personal Information
Destination British Columbia and our service providers (for support reasons), may store or access your Personal Information which may resides outside of Canada. In certain circumstances, we may need to disclose your personal information to our service providers in order to facilitate the operation of our website, database, email marketing software or processing of payment transactions. In some cases, these service providers may reside outside of Canada. Before any personal information is disclosed, all recipient organizations must agree to protect the privacy of personal information in a contractual manner consistent with our policy and compliant with BC’s Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act.
Security of Your Information
Destination British Columbia is obligated to protect personal information by making reasonable security arrangements against such risks as unauthorized access, collection, use, disclosure or disposal. Security measures, such as the use of SSL encryption, have been integrated into the design, implementation and day-to-day operating practices as part our commitment to protect the information we hold.
The personal information submitted is secure once it reaches the Destination British Columbia server. In transit between a computer and the server, all information is secured using SSL encryption, which the web browser typically denotes using a lock icon.

Contests
Destination British Columbia runs a variety of contests on the HelloBC.com website that our online visitors can optionally enter. We use online contest entry forms to collect personal information deemed necessary for your participation in a contest. While certain information is mandatory for participation, most information is optional. Contest entry forms differentiate between the two so that you are aware of what information is needed, and what information you need not provide in order to participate. As part of the contest entry process, we may provide an opportunity for you to give Destination British Columbia permission to contact you in the future. Giving your permission for future contact is completely optional, and does not impact your ability to participate in a contest.
When you provide us with your personal information to enter a contest, we retain and use it in accordance with the  Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act. Your information is only used for the purpose for which it was collected (e.g. to support your participation in a contest), or for a use consistent with that purpose (e.g. to allow us to conduct tourism-related research or surveys, or provide you with information on other contests or tourism opportunities with your consent). Our objective is to measure the success of our tourism marketing campaigns, and help us understand the characteristics and travel preferences of our consumers in order to serve them to the best of our ability.
We work closely with our Information Technology team to ensure the contest entry data we receive is securely stored and may only be accessed by authorized staff and approved contest service providers. Any service provider that we engage for a given contest must agree to and comply with the BC Government’s terms and conditions for protecting personal information in order to do business with us. Effectively safeguarding all personal information in our custody is of paramount importance to Destination British Columbia.
