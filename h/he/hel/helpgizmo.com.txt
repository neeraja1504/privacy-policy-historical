This information may also include clickstream data, which is information about the page-by-page paths you take as you browse through the Website.
The methods that we and our service providers may use to automatically collect such information include:
Log Information: We collect information about your use of our Website, such as the type of browser you use, access times, pages viewed, your IP address and the referring link through which you accessed the Website. We may link this information to other information we collect about you. We do this to improve services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or site functionality.
Information Collected by Tracking Technologies: We and our service providers may use cookies, web beacons and other tracking technologies to collect information about you when you interact with the Website or emails, including information about your browsing and purchasing behavior. We may combine this information with other information we collect about you and use it for various purposes, such as improving the Website and your online experience, understanding which areas and features of the Website are popular, counting visits, understanding campaign effectiveness, tailoring our communications with you, determining whether an email has been opened and links within the email have been clicked, and for other internal business purposes.

These cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, tracking user preferences or web pages visited while using the Website.

We may also obtain your contact information from third parties that market mailing lists. If we receive Personal Information from a third-party source and/or if we combine the information we receive from these third-party sources with your Personal Information, we will treat that information as Personal Information.

We must disclose your Personal Information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
In addition, we may share information about you as follows:
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in response to subpoenas or other legal process or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, or investigate fraud;

In our sole discretion, we may also share aggregated or de-identified information, which cannot reasonably be used to identify you.
Referrals and Promotions.
We may offer referrals, surveys and other promotions (each, a “Promotion”) that may require registration. If you choose to enter a Promotion, your Personal Information may be disclosed to third parties in connection with the administration of such Promotion. By entering a Promotion, you are agreeing to the official rules that govern that Promotion, which may contain specific requirements of you, including, except where prohibited by law, allowing the sponsor and/or other parties to use your name, voice and/or likeness in advertising or marketing materials.
Advertising, Analytics Services, and Online Tracking
We engage third parties to serve advertisements on our behalf across the internet and to provide analytics services about the use of the Website. In addition, we may participate in online advertising networks and exchanges that display relevant advertisements to our Website visitors based on their interests as reflected in their browsing of the Website and certain third party sites participating in the same networks and exchanges. Those entities may use cookies, web beacons, pixels, and other technologies to automatically collect information about your use of the Website, such as your IP address, web browser, pages viewed, time spent on pages, links clicked and conversion information. This information may be used by us and others to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests on the Website and other websites, and better understand your online activity.
This means that some information about your browsing of the Website and certain third-party sites may be shared with these companies for the purpose of delivering ads to you on the Website and certain third-party sites, and we may receive from some of these companies information about third-party sites that you have visited. This information is used for marketing purposes and the practice is sometimes termed “retargeting” to indicate that information from one retailer is used to suggest to you relevant products offered by another retailer.
If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out of certain targeted advertising by clicking on the unsubscribe link at the bottom on any email or by sending an email to marketing@surveygizmo.com with the subject of Unsubscribe. Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads. You will continue to receive generic ads.
These and other third parties may also collect Personal Information about your online activities over time and across different websites when you use the Website.
This Privacy Policy does not cover any use of information that such third parties themselves may have collected from you or the methods used by the third-parties to collect that information (e.g., cookies, web beacons and clear gifs).
Note that your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to websites and online services you visit. As of the effective date of this Privacy Policy, there is no consensus among industry participants as to what “Do Not Track” means in this context. Like many websites and online services, we currently do not alter our practices when we receive a “Do Not Track” signal from a visitor’s browser. To find out more about “Do Not Track,” you may wish to visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com.
Community Features and User Contributions
The Website may provide you the opportunity to participate and post content publicly through chat rooms, forums, interactive features, or other communication functionality (“Interactive Services”). We may provide functionality for you to submit or post text (including questions, comments, and suggestions), photographs, audio, videos, or other content (collectively, “User Contributions”) through Interactive Services, by linking the Website to a third-party service, or otherwise. Please note that certain information, such as your username and profile picture, may be publicly displayed on the Website along with your User Contributions. Contributions consisting of uploaded files may contain metadata, which may contain Personal Information or other information about or relating to you. You may wish to remove metadata from your file(s) before transmitting such file(s) to the Website.
Note that anything you post through the Interactive Services is public—others will have access to your User Contributions and may use it or share it with third parties. If you choose to voluntarily disclose Personal Information through your User Contributions, that information will be considered public information. If you submit User Contributions, they may be published online or offline at any time. In addition, we may use your User Contributions and any excerpt from your User Contributions in connection with our advertising, marketing, publicity and promotional activities. To request removal of your Personal Information from our community features, contact us at compliance@surveygizmo.com with the subject of Remove Personal Information. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your Personal Information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.
Social Features
Certain functionality on the Website may permit interactions that you initiate between the Website and a third-party website or service (“Social Features”). Examples of Social Features include enabling you to “like” or “share” our Website content to other websites or services; to log in to the Website using your username and password for a third-party site or service; to transmit content to the Website from your account on a third-party website or service; and to otherwise connect the Website to a third-party website or service.
If you choose to use Social Features, information you post or provide access to may be publicly displayed on the website or by the provider of the Social Feature that you use. Similarly, if you post information on a third-party platform that references our Website (e.g., by using a hashtag associated with SurveyGizmo in a tweet or status update), your post may be published on the website in accordance with the terms of the third party website or service. Also, both SurveyGizmo and the third party may have access to certain information about you and your use of the Website and the third-party website or service. In addition, we may receive information about you if other users of a third-party website give us access to their profiles and you are one of their “connections,” or information about you is otherwise accessible through your “connections’“ web pages, profile pages, or similar pages on a social networking or other third-party website or interactive service. These Social Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Social Features to function properly.
The information we collect in connection with Social Features is subject to this Privacy Policy. The information collected and stored by the third party remains subject to the third party’s privacy practices, including whether the third party continues to share information with us, the types of information shared, and your choices with regard to what is visible to others on that third party website or service.
Third-Party Websites
There may be hyperlinks on the Website to other websites or locations that are operated and controlled by third parties (“Third-Party Websites”). These Third-Party Websites may use their own cookies, web beacons and other technologies to independently collect information about you. In addition, these Third-Party Websites may solicit Personal Information from you. We make no representations regarding the policies or business practices of such Third-Party Websites and encourage you to familiarize yourself with their privacy policies before providing them with your Personal Information.
Data Security
We take reasonable measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. When you enter information (such as login credentials) on our login form, we encrypt the transmission of that information using transport layer security (TLS). Although SurveyGizmo uses reasonable efforts to help protect your information, transmission via the internet is not completely secure and SurveyGizmo cannot guarantee the security of your information collected through the Website. If you have any questions about security on our Website, you can contact us at compliance@surveygizmo.com
Data Retention
We take reasonable steps to delete your information collected through the Website if you opt out of receiving further communications from us (see the section entitled Your Choices below) or if you ask us to delete your information.
SurveyGizmo retains data that we process on behalf of our customers, and collect from our customers directly, for as long as it is needed to provide services to our customers. SurveyGizmo will retain and use this data as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
Your California Privacy Rights
California law permits California residents to request certain details about how their information is shared with third parties and, in some cases, affiliates, for those third parties’ and affiliates’ own direct marketing purposes. SurveyGizmo does not share Personal Information with third parties or affiliates for those third parties’ or affiliates’ own direct marketing purposes.

HIPAA Compliance
We strive for compliance with HIPAA (the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act). However, if you are transmitting or storing personal health information or HIPAA applies to you in any other way, you are obligated to notify us and engage in our HIPAA compliance procedures, which may include signing a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with us as well as ensuring that your account tier includes the feature of data encryption at-rest and in transit that individual users (e.g. you) must ensure is enabled. For other compliance measures, you may be obligated to perform yourself within your account, including turning on data encryption in-transfer (SSL links).
