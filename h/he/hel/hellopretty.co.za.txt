Privacy Policy | Hello Pretty. Buy design.
Dear Hello Pretty users who are rightly skeptical of internet safety and security,
Welcome to our Privacy Policy page. We hope you like it, because it was very expensive and drawn up by a fancy and proper lawyer. They're here to protect Hello Pretty, and to protect you also. Someone has to.
Serious note: the content in the left-hand column is the Hello Pretty Privacy Policy. The right-hand column is not Hello Pretty's Privacy Policy - it is purely an attempt at providing you with a concise summary of what the left hand column is saying, in non-legalese layman's terms. We can't and won't be held liable for any content in the right-hand column of this page, as it was written by laymen. So read / interpret it at your peril.
This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for the hellopretty.co.za site. We at Hello Pretty take our users privacy seriously and we will only collect and use your personal information as outlined below and in our terms and conditions. We shall take all reasonable steps to protect your personal information.
