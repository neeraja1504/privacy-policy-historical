The Organization Collecting the Information
The data that you provide for Help Teaching is collected from the www.helpteaching.com Web site by SureSwift Worldwide.
With Whom May the Information Be Shared
In order to grow our site, we may form relationships with partners to promote Help Teaching and encourage new members to join. One form of these relationships, but not limited to this form, is a co-branded Web site which combines the partner's look-and-feel with our topic areas and content. These co-branded pages allow us to keep the member information and content hosted on our secure servers. Each new member must accept our terms and conditions, including this privacy statement. Because some partners are helping us grow by promoting the Help Teaching name and co-branded page, we sometimes share information about the members that sign up through the partner's co-branded page. In all cases, our partners commit to honoring our privacy policy. This site may from time-to-time contain links to other sites. Help Teaching is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.
Invite a Friend
If a member elects to use our referral service for informing a friend of our site, we ask them for their friend's name and e-mail address. Help Teaching will automatically send the friend a one-time e-mail inviting them to visit the site. Help Teaching does not store these e-mail addresses and names.
