He Said will never sell our integrity. Just as importantly, He Said will never rent, share, or sell our subscriber list. Not even for really hot sex. We appreciate you letting us into your email, and we promise not to abuse that trust. We make this promise because we understand just how much you value your privacy. The policy below describes how we treat the information we collect when you visit our site and/or register for He Said. Please read this carefully. There will not be a test, but it’s still important.

Your Information
We’re not interested in obtaining a list of your past indiscretions, drinking habits, or what you snagged from the office supply room. All we need is your email address. He Said doesn’t collect any information except that expressly provided by you. We will not disclose your personal information to any third party without your consent.
Other Information
In order to make our site better, we may also request other information from you. Just generic stuff—like income level or age, that will help us tailor the site to your needs. We may also share this information with third parties, but only in aggregate, anonymous form.
Usage Information
It is important for us to gather information on how our site is used: How much time do users spend on our site? What sites did they come from? What sites do they go to once they’ve had just about enough of our smartass attitude? All of this information is collected in aggregate form. None of it is personally identifiable. This information will not make it possible for us to corner the market on, say, frozen concentrated orange juice. It’s collected only to help us to, among other things, handle traffic on He Said, and to make sure that our service reaches you in the most efficient manner possible.

They are content paid for by our sponsors (allies), and only reflect the fact that our editorial staff has to put food on the table just like everybody else. Some of this money might also go towards alcohol, but we’re not saying how much.
