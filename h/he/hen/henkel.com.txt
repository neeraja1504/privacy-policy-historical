9. Use of Social Media Plug-ins
Plug-ins ‏(“plug-ins”) of the social media networks facebook.com and Twitter may be embedded in our web pages. The associated services are provided by the companies Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc. respectively ‏(“providers”).
Facebook is operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA ("Facebook"). For an overview of the Facebook plug-ins and their appearance, go to: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins
Twitter is operated by Twitter Inc., 1355 Market St, Suite 900, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA. For an overview of the Twitter buttons and their appearance, go to: https://twitter.com/about/resources/buttons
To increase the protection afforded to your data when you visit our web pages, these plug-ins are implemented as “2-click buttons.” This form of integration ensures that, when accessing a page from within our website containing such plug-ins, you are not automatically connected to the providers’ servers. Only if you activate the plug-ins, thus issuing a permission for data transmission, will the browser create a direct link to the providers’ servers. The content of the various plug-ins is then transmitted by the provider concerned directly to your browser and then displayed on your screen.
The plug-in tells the provider which of our website pages you have accessed. If, while viewing our website, you are logged into your Facebook or Twitter user account, the provider is able to collate your interest, i.e. the information you are accessing, with your user account. On making use of any of the plug-in functions ‏(e.g. clicking the “Like” button, leaving a comment), this information too will be transmitted by the browser directly to the provider for retention.
Further information on the collection and use of data by Facebook or Twitter and on the rights and possibilities available to you for protecting your privacy in these circumstances can be found in the providers’ data protection/privacy advisories:
Data protection/privacy advisory issued by Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/policy.php
Data protection/privacy advisory issued by Twitter: https://twitter.com/privacy
To avoid allowing Facebook or Twitter to link your visit of our website to your user account with these providers, you will need to log-off the respective user account prior to accessing our web pages.
