without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out.
We may, however, use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying

We use both your personally identifiable information and certain non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous
User usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of the Hentai Media

Will Hentai Media Discloses Information
We provide personally identifiable information and non-personally-identifiable information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies,
or other businesses or persons for the purpose of processing such information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to
process such information in compliance with our privacy policy, and we use reasonable efforts to limit their use of such information
and to use other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
We do not share your personally identifiable information (such as name or email address) with other, third-party companies for
their commercial or marketing use without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you
will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out.
We do share non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, referring / exit pages and URLs,
platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third-parties to assist them in understanding the usage patterns for
certain content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on the Hentai Media site.
We may release personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information if required to do so by law,
or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright Law)
or respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant.
Hentai Media also reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable
information that Hentai Media believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our Terms of Use,
take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend itself against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist
government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of our web site, and to protect the rights, property,
or personal safety of Hentai Media, our Users or others.

Third-party Advertisers & Links to Other sites
Hentai Media allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the
Hentai Media site. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser,
the advertisements and links that appear on the Hentai Media site. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens.
They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of
their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content you see.
Hentai Media does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without
your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out.
However, please note that if an advertiser asks Hentai Media to show an advertisement to a certain audience
(for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 18-24 who have viewed certain channels of content)
and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they
are trying to reach. The advertiser may also use information regarding your use of the Hentai Media site, such as the number of
times you viewed an ad (but not any personally identifiable information), to determine which ads to deliver to you.
You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks for more information on
their practices and for instructions on how to opt-out of certain practices. Hentai Media's privacy policy does not apply to,
and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web site.
Our Commitment To Childrens' Privacy
Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, Hentai Media does not knowingly collect
or maintain personally identifiable information or non-personally-identifiable information on the Hentai Media site from
persons under 18 years of age, and no part of our website is directed to persons under 18. If you are under 18 years of age,
then please do not use or access the Hentai Media site at any time or in any manner. If Hentai Media learns that personally
identifiable information of persons under 18 years of age has been collected on the Hentai Media site without verified parental
consent, then Hentai Media will take the appropriate steps to delete this user/information.

governed by U.S. law, this Privacy Notice, and our Terms of Use, you are transferring your personal information to the United States
and you consent to that transfer.
In the Event of Sale, Bankruptc or Joint Ventures
In the event that Hentai Media is acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances,
to transfer or assign the information we have collected from our Users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control.
In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the
application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors' rights generally, we may not be able to control how your personal
information is treated, transferred, or used.
