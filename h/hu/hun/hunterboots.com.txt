We have instituted safeguards to check that our internal procedures meet our high policy standards. We also use all efforts reasonably necessary to be sure that third parties who work with us as our agents to make our Website , Social Media Channels and their contents available to you, and to fulfil your orders and requests, agree to protect personal data that they must access in order to serve our Website and our visitors. We limit access to personal data about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that data to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our Website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal data transmitted to our Website and/or Social Media Channels; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your personal data, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.

The personal data that we collect about you may be transferred to, and stored at, destinations outside the European Economic Area ("EEA") by us or third parties with whom we share your personal data. It may also be processed by employees operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such employees maybe engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. As a consequence, your personal data may not be protected by equivalent data protection laws and you may not have the same rights in respect of use of your data in that country. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your personal data is treated securely and in accordance with this Policy.
