Privacy Policy • Hunter
Hunter helps businesses connect with each other by providing web applications, browser extensions, and other online services.
We are committed to respecting everyone's privacy and design our services with this goal in mind in accordance with European Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regards to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (“GDPR”) and applicable data protection laws.
In order to satisfy our customers’ expectations and to ensure the respect of data subjects’ rights, we regularly improve internal processes.
This Privacy Policy describes what data we collect and how we process it. Should you have any questions, please reach out, we'll be glad to help: contact@hunter.io.
What information does Hunter collect?
This Privacy applies to all services offered by Hunter including:
The Email Verifier
The Email Finder
The Domain Search
The Leads
The MailTracker
The Outreach
What information does Hunter collect?
When you are on our website
When you're using our website, we track your usage which includes statistics such as which pages you visit and how long you look at them. This information may include but is not limited to IP address, geolocalisation information, browser type and information about the use of our website, including a history of the pages you view.
If you create an account, we ask information such including but not limited to: your email, your name or what company you work for. All this information is used to personalize your experience or send you onboarding emails and invoices. In cases of high-risk of fraud, we might ask for a phone number for verification purposes (we never use it for marketing purposes). If you become a paying customer, we will collect your payment card information.
When you use our services
Whether it is through the API, the website, the Google Sheets add-on, or the browser extensions we provide; we monitor your usage, and log requests that you make. Those logs can include IP address, geolocalization information, browser type, etc. We destroy those logs at the latest after 4 months.
When using our services, you might send us some data or data files (for the Email Finder and the Email Verifier for example).
When you contact our support
If you reach out via email or chat, we keep conversations and other data you might send during those exchanges. When you delete your account, those conversations are removed after a period of up to 6 months.
When someone uses the MailTracker
Our users can send emails through their usual Gmail interface and our MailTracker extension will provide tracking information. We’ll let them know if we think their emails have been opened, where and how many times.
We store the approximate location of the person opening the emails using IP addresses. To respect their privacy, the IP addresses collected this way are pseudonymized making it impossible to precisely localize them.
The recipients, subject or content of emails are never stored or sent to our servers. We only store the identification numbers of emails and conversations (for example “1617567580158230396”).
When someone uses the Outreach
When connecting their Gmail or G Suite accounts, our users can send emails through Hunter. Through our dashboard, we’ll provide tracking information and help manage replies.
As with the MailTracker, we store the location of the person opening the emails using IP addresses. To respect their privacy, the IP addresses collected this way are pseudonymized making it impossible to precisely localize them.
As Hunter provides an interface to organize outreach efforts, we need to store emails sent (which includes the recipients, subjects and content) and the potential replies they receive. To increase the productivity of our users, certain features might perform searches in their mailboxes; the emails returned will be temporarily stored on our servers.
The Gmail data used by the Outreach feature is never shared with third-parties. It stays private to the user and his or her team if applicable.
When we parse public web data
We use servers to look at publicly available online pages and process business data on them. Only public pages are looked at and only publicly available online data that can be found by a search engine are indexed by our servers. If a website, via a robots.txt file, asks crawlers not to look at the content, we respect this indication. Our robots view systematically the robot.txt file before exploring and indexing the public data available on the website. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of other websites.
On those public pages, we look for business data such as names, professional emails, social networks URLs, etc. If we come across private consumer data (for example a Gmail or Hotmail address), we do not process it.
How we use your data
To provide our services
When creating an account, you agree to our Terms of Service which allows us to process your data to give you access to Hunter. This way, you can have an account on our website, save and process leads, invite other team members, etc.
To improve the User Experience
We're looking at usage patterns and various statistics to understand what to improve on Hunter. This includes, for example, doing A/B testing on new features.
We’re also using the data that goes through our services to improve the services themselves. We only use this information to validate data we already have or that is being supplied by a user, not to enrich our databases.
To inform businesses regarding content that is publicly displayed online
To provide the service, we also give you access to the publicly accessible business data we have indexed. It is important for our users' (and the businesses they work for) to have access to the business data already shared on the web. This helps them discover relevant contacts within companies they want to reach out to.
To offer customer support
We provide customer support via email or chat, to help you take full advantage of our service or fix any problem you encounter.
To fight fraud
There are always bad actors on the web: We actively fight credit card fraud and misuse of our services.
To market new services
Regularly, we launch new services. We’ll let users know about those releases if they have asked us to keep them up to date.
