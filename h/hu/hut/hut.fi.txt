The General Data Protection Regulation grants the data subject a number of rights with which the data subject can govern the processing of their personal data. The data subject may use the following rights in relation to Aalto insofar as Aalto acts as the controller for the data subject’s personal data:
Right of access and right to rectification
You have the right to receive confirmation on whether we process personal data relating to you and the right to access any such personal data. Aalto may ask you to specify your request where necessary, for example with regard to the details of the provision of information.
In addition, you have the right to request the rectification of incorrect personal data relating to you, or to supplement incomplete personal data that Aalto is processing.
Right to data erasure
You have the right to request erasure of your personal data from our data systems. Aalto will comply with your request, provided that there is no legitimate reason to retain the data, such as a statutory obligation to continue processing the personal data. Personal data may not be deleted instantly from backup copies and other such data systems, but will be deleted through regular database retention practices.
Right to object
You also have the right to object to the processing of your personal data if your personal data is processed for other purposes than the fulfillment of legal responsibilities or the provision of services. You may object to the processing of your personal data for purposes of direct marketing, even if the basis for such processing is consent given by you in the past. Objecting to the processing of your personal data may lead to limitation of the usage of the Aalto website. You have the right to prohibit direct marketing by following the instructions contained in all of our marketing messages.
Right to restriction of processing
If you contest the correctness of the data which we have registered about you or the lawfulness of processing, or if you have objected to the processing of the data in accordance with your right to object, you may request us to restrict the processing of these data to only storage. The processing will only be restricted to storage, until the correctness of the data can be established, or until it is assured that our legitimate interests override your interests.
If you are not entitled to erasure of the data which we have registered about you, you may instead request that we restrict the processing of these data to only storage. If the processing of the data which we have registered about you is solely necessary to assert a legal claim, you may also demand that other processing of these data be restricted to storage. We may process your data for other purposes if this is necessary to assert a legal claim or if you have granted your consent to this.
Right to data portability
You have the right to receive your personal data from us in a structured, commonly used format so that you may transfer your personal data to another controller, provided that the processing of your personal data is based on consent or a contract between you and Aalto.
