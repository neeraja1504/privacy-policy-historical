You consent to us using the information you have submitted to contact you in relation to those special features and activities and to administer your participation in those activities.
Any information posted on group or personal discussion forums may become public information. While we strive to protect and respect your privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose in a bulletin board or discussion forum.

Transaction Information
HumanIPO cannot accept your order until you have paid for it in full. You may pay by Visa, EuroCard or MasterCard, (only a credit card may be used).
Upon payment, HumanIPO will confirm receipt of your order by an acknowledgement displayed onscreen once your payment details have been accepted, followed by an e-mail which will be sent to the e-mail address you provide on your order details.
You will have an opportunity to check and correct any input errors in your order up until the point at which you submit your order by clicking the “confirm order” button on the checkout page.
HumanIPO reserves the right to choose not to accept your order for any reason, at its discretion, and will not be liable to you or anyone else in those circumstances.

If you are not happy to proceed, or we are unable to obtain your instructions, we will cancel the order and provide you with a full refund of any monies debited.
By using a credit card to pay for your order, you confirm that the card being used is yours. All credit card holders are subject to validation checks and authorization by the card issuer. If the issuer of your card refuses to authorize payment, we will not accept your order and we will not be liable for any delay and we are not obliged to inform you of the reason for the refusal. We are not responsible for your card issuer or bank charging you as a result of our processing of your credit card payment in accordance with your order.
When you pay the monthly fee or for using any other services provided by HumanIPO, we ask you to provide information related to each transaction, consisting of your full name, contact information (address, phone number, email), the amount of the transaction, and the type of the credit card you use for the transaction and the verification code of your card.

We also collect the Internet address (IP address) and other identifying information about the computer or device you use to access your HumanIPO account, in order to help detect possible instances of unauthorized transactions.
In the unlikely event of fraudulent or unauthorized use of your payment card by someone else to purchase goods from us on our server we will refund to you any money received by us as a result but only if you have notified your payment card issuer and us by emailing us on support@humanipo.com as soon as you became aware of the unauthorized use of your card.
We recommend that you do not communicate your payment card details to anyone, including us, by e-mail. We cannot be responsible for any losses you may incur in transmitting information to us by internet link or by e-mail. Any such loss shall not be borne either wholly or partly by us, and shall be entirely your responsibility.
