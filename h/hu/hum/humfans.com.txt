Although Lahmun will take reasonable steps to protect your information and make sure it is safe and secure and Lahmun use a number of physical, administrative, personnel and technical measures to protect your personal information, Lahmun cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to the Website; any transmission is at your own risk.
