II.Fraud and credit check
If you provided your consent to this provision on our Website (by ticking the relevant checkbox), you agree to the collection, processing and use of your personal data as described below:
To reduce the risk of bad debts as far as possible, we carry out an mainly automatic fraud and credit check on our Website during and after completion of the order process. On this basis we decide what methods of payment we can offer you, if any, and/or whether we can carry out your order to the extent desired by you.
You hereby consent to the fraud and credit checks described in detail below being carried out by arvato eCommerce Beteiligungsgesellschaft mbH (An der Autobahn, 33333 Gütersloh, Germany) (“arvato”) and to the processing of your personal data by arvato for this purpose. arvato will only act in accordance with our instructions and is bound by an agreement on commissioned processing of data as set out in section 11 German Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz – BDSG).
1. Checks before completion of the order
a) Collection of device data
During the order process, we will transmit the technical details of the device used (in particular the browser version, operating system and your IP address) to arvato. arvato will use this data to create a hash ID in order to be able to check and recognise this specific device.
As the order process progresses, arvato will match this hash ID with the personal data used for the order. This means that arvato will store which contact details (salutation, first name and last name, postal address, e-mail address) and delivery and billing addresses (jointly the “Contact Details”) are used by this specific device for each order transaction. arvato uses these details to identify potential suspected fraud during the credit checks described below (see clauses C. II 1. bb) und C.II. 2 a)).
b) Performance of pre-risk checks
As soon as you have clicked on “continue” after entering your contact details during the order process, arvato starts the fraud and credit check by carrying out a pre-risk check. This pre-risk check includes in particular the following checks:
aa) In order to check whether the billing and delivery addresses are valid, arvato will forward your address details to AZ Direct GmbH (Richard-Neutra-Gasse 9, 1210 Vienna, Austria) who will check whether the address is correct, notably whether the address specified exists and whether people can be found there.
bb) Checking the device data
In addition, arvato will check whether the hash ID obtained from your device data has been clearly classified as suspicious during fraud checks in our Online Store in the past.
cc) Comparing the Contact Details specified with the customer data already stored by us
In addition, we will compare the Contact Details specified in your current order with the customer data already stored by us. This is primarily for technical data management purposes, so that the system is able to recognise returning customers. Moreover, arvato compares your Contact Details with the results of the complete fraud checks carried out in the past.
dd) Limit check
arvato will also carry out a limit check on your Contact Details and the order value. The purpose of this is to assess whether the order value limit configured as the limit for each individual order, the order value per address or the order value per customer (“Debit Limit”) has been reached. Configuration of the Debit Limit (maximum order value per customer) is based on the results of the complete fraud checks carried out in the past.
ee) Checking information from our accounts receivables
arvato also checks the information from our accounts receivables, especially whether any outstanding items exist, reminders have been issued or collection processes are ongoing and to what value. When checking this information, we transmit the latest information from our accounts receivables (outstanding items, reminders, ongoing collection processes, payment receipts) to arvato on a daily basis.
ff) Result of checks
If the result of the various checks carried out as part of the pre-risk check is already clearly negative, we will only allow you to order using safe methods, i.e. no purchase on account.
2. Fraud checks on completion of the order
a) Automatic fraud check based on your device data
Once you have completed your order (by clicking on “place order and pay”) arvato will carry out the automatic fraud check. This is based on predefined rules and checks whether the order is to be classified as suspicious. In the course of this, arvato checks in particular the frequency of orders and the Contact Details provided in order to identify suspicious orders. To do so, we set fraud parameters, e.g. the number of different names or e-mail addresses that may be used per hash ID, based on which arvato should be able to identify suspicious transactions.
b) Manual fraud check
If the automatic fraud check describes above leads to a clear suspicion of fraud, arvato will tell us to cancel the order concerned. In unclear cases, arvato will additionally carry out a manual fraud check. During the manual fraud check. The result of this manual fraud check can also lead to the order being cancelled.
