Hubwit - The digital services ecommerce
This document aims to describe the modalities of treatment and management of personal data from the website Hubwit.com and its associated. In particular with reference to the collection and processing of personal data of all Users, they could be both “Registered Users” (“Sellers” / “Buyers”) or simple “Unregistered Users”, that are visiting the site.
For definitions of “Users”, “Registered Users” (“Sellers” / “Buyers”) or “Unregistered Users” see the Terms of Use of the site Hubwit.com. This information relates only to the processing of the data provided on the site Hubwit.com (also through the use of the Videochat service provided by LOEM) and not to those provided to other Web sites accessed through links, banners or others redirect.
Owner and Manager of the treatment
1) The data controller is the company LOEM Sas, based in Giovanni Plana 9 Street, P.I. IT10495580010, registration number in the register of Economic Activities, REA, TO-1138107, email address: info@hubwit.com ( hereinafter, for brevity “LOEM”).
2) Responsible for processing under Article. 29 of Legislative Decree 196/03 is the firm LOEM Sas.
Collection and processing of data
3) LOEM collects and treats all personal data of the "Users" in full compliance with the Italian national legislation on personal data and in particular D.Decree 196/2003 and the Recommendation. 2/2001 made by the Working Group for the protection of personal data of the European Union.
Obligation to provide data
4) The collection of personal data that is required is an essential prerequisite for access to some services offered on the website Hubwit.com. And also for the proper management in the interests of the "Users". In particular, in order to use certain services of the site and be registered as "Sellers" or "Buyers", you must subscribe to the site, filling out a registration form.
5) The missing data, as well as conferring partial or inaccurate details, has the effect of preventing the proper delivery of the service. The '"Registered User" is committed to constantly update and correct their personal information.
6) The services offered on the website Hubwit.com are reserved only for adults. The "User" declares, by registering, that have already turned 18 and can validly give their consent and properly dispose of their rights.
7) When "Users" create an account, some information may be provided to other "Users". In particular, they will be displayed the account opening date, the age and sex (where the '"Registered User" has decided to make them public), or the profile picture, if present.
8) "Users" are aware that any personal information or content deliberately spread online, may be collected and used by third. LOEM is not responsible for any use made by these third parties.
Type of datas and treatment purpose

12) The provision of personal information marked with an asterisk on the registration form (name and surname, date of birth, e-mail) is required in order to complete the registration process. Consequently, the missing, partial or incorrect entry of such datas will make invalid the registration and the “User” will not be able to use the services.
13) The "Sellers" can freely decide whether to use their PayPal account or credit card. In case where the "Seller" opts for the payment through PayPal, he is obliged to provide details of his PayPal account. However if he decides to use a credit card, the "Seller" will be required to enter from time to time, at the time of payment, the details for the credit card used.
14) The datas which are not marked with an asterisk (such as a second e-mail, a mobile phone number or consumption preferences) is purely optional: their missing, partial or incorrect entry will not prevent the access to the site and the subsequently subscription to the services offered.
