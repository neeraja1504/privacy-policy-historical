Your data has been entered into a licencing or regulatory data base by your employer/contract holder.
You have been involved in the purchase of a product using our website.
You have registered on one of our online collaboration or membership services.
Your data protection rights
Under data protection law, you have rights we need to make you aware of. The rights available to you depend on our reason for processing your information.
Your right of access
You have the right to ask[4] us for copies of your personal information. This right always applies. There are some exemptions, which means you may not always receive all the information we process.
Your right to rectification
You have the right to ask us to rectify information[5] you think is inaccurate. You also have the right to ask us to complete information you think is incomplete. This right always applies.
Your right to erasure
You have the right to ask us to erase[6] your personal information in certain circumstances.
Your right to restriction of processing
You have the right to ask us to restrict[7] the processing of your information in certain circumstances.
Your right to object to processing
You have the right to object to processing[8] if we are able to process your information because the process forms part of our public tasks, or is in our legitimate interests.
Your right to data portability
This only applies to information you have given us. You have the right to ask that we transfer the information[9] you gave us from one organisation to another, or give it to you. The right only applies if we are processing information based on your consent or under, or in talks about entering into a contract and the processing is automated.
If we are processing your information for criminal law enforcement purposes, your rights are slightly different. Please see the Investigations for law enforcement purposes[10] section of the notice.
You are not required to pay any charge for exercising your rights. We have one month to respond to you.
Please contact us at [email protected][11] if you wish to make a request.
Service adjustments and retention
As a public authority and a provider of services to the public, we have a legal duty to comply with the Equality Act (2010).
This means we need to make service adjustments for anyone with a disability who contacts us in any capacity, to eliminate any barriers to accessing our services. Our legal basis for processing this information is article 6(1)(c) of the GDPR as we have a legal obligation to provide this. Our processing of special category data, such as health information you give us, will be based on article 9(2)(a), which means we need your consent.
We'll create a record of your adjustment requirements. These will give your name, contact details and type of adjustment required, along with a brief description of why it is required. Relevant staff can access this to ensure they are communicating with you in the required way.
How long we keep your data
We will retain your personal data for as long as is necessary for the purpose it was collected.
At the end of the retention period, your personal data will be disposed of securely.
If you have subscribed to an email alert or subscription service, we will keep your personal data for as long as you are subscribed to that service or are required to by law and we will delete that data if you have requested it to be removed.
Sharing your information
We will not share your information with any third parties for the purposes of direct marketing.
We use data processors who are third parties who provide elements of services for us. We have contracts in place with our data processors. This means that they cannot do anything with your personal information unless we have instructed them to do it. They will not share your personal information with any organisation apart from us. They will hold it securely and retain it for the period we instruct, in accordance with appropriate data retention policies.
In circumstances where we are a joint controller this notice will outline how we will manage your data and the other party will also explain how they manage your data.
In some circumstances we are legally obliged to share information. For example, under a court order or where we cooperate with other European supervisory authorities in handling complaints or investigations. We might also share information with other regulatory bodies or law enforcement agencies in order to further their, or our, objectives. In any scenario, we'll satisfy ourselves that we have a lawful basis on which to share the information and document our decision making and satisfy ourselves we have a legal basis on which to share the information.
In our capacity as UK regulator for enforcing health and safety in the workplace, there are some circumstances where we must cooperate with and help other supervisory authorities in the EEA, in handling complaints, investigations and to regulate the movement of materials (e.g. explosives and chemicals) This may lead to sharing personal information if it is relevant to these tasks.
We may also share your information in the event of the non-payment of a Civil Monetary Penalty. If the debt remains outstanding after the specified timeframe for payment, no payment plan is in place or an agreed payment plan is not being adhered to, we may initiate formal proceedings to recover the full amount of the unpaid penalty. As a result, the HSE will share personal data with the litigation and recovery specialists it instructs in order for them to identify assets and undertake recovery action through the courts.
Links to other websites
Where we provide links to websites of other organisations, this privacy notice does not cover how that organisation processes personal information. We encourage you to read the privacy notices on the other websites you visit. Please also see disclaimer[12] advice.
Your right to complain
We work to high standards when it comes to processing your personal information. If you have queries or concerns, you can make a complaint to HSE[13] and we'll respond.
If you remain dissatisfied, you can make a complaint[14] to the UK supervisory authority the Information Commissioners Office about the way we process your personal information.
Changes to this privacy notice
We keep our privacy notice under regular review to make sure it is up to date and accurate. It was last updated 06 March 2019.
Children's information
We do not provide services directly to children or proactively collect their personal information. However, we are sometimes given or collect information about children while handling a complaint or conducting an investigation. The information in the relevant parts of this notice applies to children as well as adults.
Calling our helpline
When you call our main helpline (0300 003 1647), we collect Calling Line Identification (CLI) information. This is the phone number you are calling from (if it's not withheld). We hold a log of the phone number, date, time and duration of the call, but do not audio record the call itself. We hold this information for 90 days.
We use this information to understand the demand for our services and to improve how we operate. We may also use the number to call you back if you have asked us to do so, if your call drops, or if there is a problem with the line. We may also use it to check how many calls we have received from it.
We don't audio record any calls, but we might make notes to help us answer your query. Other HSE staff may also listen in during your call for training or quality assurance purposes.
We operate a textphone service which is particularly useful if you are deaf, hard of hearing or speech impaired. We do not keep any call information or messages left on the phone.
We also hold statistical information about the calls we receive for a number of years, but this does not contain any personal data.
Social media
We only use social media to deliver messages and do not gather personal data from this. Please refer to the privacy policy of the social platform you are using.
Emailing us
We use Transport Layer Security (TLS) to encrypt and protect email traffic in line with government guidance on email security. Most webmail such as Gmail and Hotmail use TLS by default.
We'll also monitor any emails sent to us, including file attachments, for viruses or malicious software. You must ensure that any email you send is within the bounds of the law.

Reasons for us holding your Personal Data
Raising a concern
Purpose and legal basis for processing
Our purpose is to regulate Health and Safety in line with our statutory duties under the Health and Safety at work Act 1974, including inspection and investigation activities.
The legal basis we rely on to process your personal data is article 6(1)(e) of the GDPR, which allows us to process personal data when this is necessary to perform our public tasks as a regulator.
If the information you provide us in relation to your complaint contains special category data, such as health, religious or ethnic information the legal basis we rely on to process it is article 9(2)(g) of the GDPR, which also relates to our public task and the safeguarding of your fundamental rights. And Schedule 1 part 2(6) of the DPA2018 which relates to statutory and government purposes.
What we need
We need information from you to investigate your concern properly, so our complaint forms are designed to prompt you to give us everything we need to understand what's happened.
When we receive a complaint from you, we'll set up a case file. This normally includes your contact details and any other information you have given us about the other parties in your complaint.
Why we need it
We need to know the details of your concern, so we can investigate it and fulfil our regulatory function.
What we do with it
We will use your personal information to investigate your complaint and check on our level of service. We compile and publish statistics showing information like the number of complaints we receive, but not in a form that identifies anyone.
No third parties have access to your personal information unless the law allows them to do so. If you don't want information that identifies you to be shared with the organisation you have raised a concern about, we'll try to respect that. However, it is not always possible to handle a concern on an anonymous basis so may contact you to discuss this.
If you are acting on behalf of someone making a complaint, we'll ask for information to satisfy us of your identity and if relevant, ask for information to show you have authority to act on someone else's behalf.
How long we keep your data
We will retain your personal data for as long as is necessary for the purpose it was collected.
At the end of the retention period, your personal data will be disposed of securely.
What are your data protection rights?
We are acting in our official capacity to investigate your complaint, so you have the right to object to our processing of your personal data. There are legitimate reasons why we may refuse your objection, which depend on why we are processing it.

We'll also publish information in a yearly report about any action we take as a result of disclosures by whistle blowers. This won't, however, contain any information that will identify individual whistle blowers or their employers (including ex-employers).
We will use your personal information to process your complaint and to check on the level of service we provide. We compile and publish statistics showing such information as the number of complaints we receive, but not in a form that identifies anyone.

Investigations for law enforcement purposes
Purpose and legal basis for processing
As part of our statutory functions, we investigate and prosecute individuals and organisations for alleged criminal offences committed under the legislation we regulate (The health and Safety at work act 1974 and other regulations) The Health and Safety Executive is named as a competent authority for the purpose of Part 3 of the DPA 2018 which applies to the processing of personal data by such authorities for law enforcement purposes.
These purposes are set out at section31 of the DPA 2018 and are the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, which might include the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security. Our processing is either done because it is necessary for the performance of a task relating to one of these purposes or with the consent of the individual.
We process personal data for the purposes of law enforcement of the legislation for which we are regulator in the following three areas:
Criminal investigations
Intelligence
Financial recovery
Our processing can also include sensitive processing which means processing special category data for law enforcement purposes. Where this is the case we rely on either the consent of the individual or, provided the processing is strictly necessary for the law enforcement purposes, on a condition set out in Schedule 8 of the DPA 2018. Our Safeguards Policy explains about our processing (including sensitive processing) for law enforcement purposes, our procedures for complying with the data protection principles and our policies for retention and erasure of any personal data.
What we need
When we investigate an alleged criminal offence, we gather information and evidence which might include information about victims, suspects, witnesses and other individuals relevant to the circumstances and events. This information may include samples and photographic or CCTV information.
Why we need it
In our role as a competent authority, we need to establish whether offences have been committed so that we can take legal action if appropriate. So, we'll gather information relevant to our investigation which might include information about you.
What we do with it
We use your personal information for the purposes of our investigation and, and for prosecution purposes if appropriate.
In some circumstances we may share your personal information with other law enforcement bodies/agencies during an investigation. We may also share it with others such as expert witnesses or specialist investigators working on behalf of the HSE.
If we are considering taking legal action, we'll share this information with our external legal counsel, the courts and any co-defendants and their legal representatives. Court cases are held in public and so personal data, including special category data, might be made public during proceedings.
When we successfully prosecute someone, we may publish the convicted individual's identity in our Annual Report, on our website or distribute more widely to the media.
How long we keep your data
We will retain your personal data for as long as is necessary for the purpose it was collected.
At the end of the retention period, your personal data will be disposed of securely.
What are your data protection rights?
You have a right to access your personal data held by or for us. You also have a right to get inaccurate data rectified and incomplete data completed, and for your personal data to be erased in certain circumstances.
We will provide further information directly to data subjects in specific cases to enable them to exercise their rights. This might be in cases where we are processing your personal data that was collected without your knowledge.
We will not do this where doing so would be prejudicial to our investigation or for other reasons set out in s.44 (4) Data Protection Act 2018.
Do we use any data processors?
Yes – we may use external legal counsel for court proceedings, specialist investigators or testing facilities.
Apply for a job or secondment
Purpose and legal basis for processing
Our purpose for processing this information is to assess your suitability for a role you have applied for.
The legal basis we rely on for processing your personal data is article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR, which relates to processing necessary to perform a contract or to take steps at your request, before entering a contract.

What information do we ask for, and why?
We do not collect more information than we need to fulfil our stated purposes and will not keep it longer than necessary.
The information we ask for is used to assess your suitability for employment. You don't have to provide what we ask for, but it may affect your application if you don't.
Application stage
If you use our online application system, your details will be collected by a data processor on our behalf.
We ask you for your personal details including name and contact details. We'll also ask you about previous experience, education and for answers to questions relevant to the role. Our recruitment team will have access to all this information.
You will also be asked to provide equal opportunities information. This is not mandatory – if you don't provide it, it won't affect your application. We won't make the information available to any staff outside our recruitment team, including hiring managers, in a way that can identify you. Any information you provide will be used to produce and monitor equal opportunities statistics.

a criminal records declaration to declare any unspent convictions
your email address, which we'll pass to the Government Recruitment Service, which will contact you to complete an application for a Basic Criminal Record check via the Disclosure and Barring Service, or Access NI, which will verify your declaration of unspent convictions.

We'll also ask you to complete a questionnaire about your health to establish your fitness to work.
We may also ask you to complete a PPE order form if it is necessary for your role.

bank details – to process salary payments
emergency contact details – so we know who to contact in case you have an emergency at work

Before or just after appointment
Some roles require a higher level of security clearance – this will be clear on the advert or job description (or both). If you are required to have a National Security Vetting prior to the commencement of your role, it will be managed between HSE and United Kingdom Security Vetting (UKSV) [18] the UKSV will tell us whether your application is successful or not. If it is not, we will not be told the reasons, but we may need to review your suitability for the role or how you perform your duties.
Our Code of Conduct requires all staff to declare if they have any potential conflicts of interest, If you complete a declaration, the information will be held on your personnel file. You will also need to declare any secondary employment.
Secondments
We also offer opportunities for people to come and work with us on a secondment basis. We accept applications from individuals or organisations who think they could benefit from their staff working with us.
Applications are sent directly to us. Once we have considered your application, if we are interested in speaking to you further, we'll contact you using the details you give.
We may ask you to provide more information about your skills and experience or invite you to an interview.
If you are seconded to us, you will be expected to adhere to a confidentiality agreement and code of conduct, which will be agreed with your organisation.
We may also ask you to complete our pre-employment checks or to obtain security clearance via the National Security Vetting process – both of which are described in this notice. Whether you need to do this will depend on the type of work you will be doing for us. We ask for this information so that we fulfil our obligations to avoid conflicts of interest and to protect the information we hold.
How long is the information kept for?
We will retain your personal data for as long as is necessary for the purpose it was collected at the end of the retention period; your personal data will be disposed of securely.
