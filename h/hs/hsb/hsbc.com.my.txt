Your privacy matters to us
This section provides specific details of how we treat any personal information you might wish to provide us when you visit this site.
Data security
Security is our top priority. HSBC Bank Malaysia Berhad ('the Bank') will strive at all times to ensure that your personal data will be protected against unauthorised or accidental access, processing or erasure. We maintain this commitment to data security by implementing appropriate physical, electronic and managerial measures to safeguard and secure your personal data.
The secure area of our website supports the use of Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol and 128-encryption technology- an industry standard for encryption over the Internet to protect data. When you provide sensitive information such as credit card details, it will be automatically converted into codes before being securely dispatched over the Internet.
Our web servers are protected behind "firewalls" and our systems are monitored to prevent any unauthorised access. We will not send personal information to you by ordinary email. As the security of ordinary email cannot be guaranteed, you should only send email to us using the secure email facility on our website.
All practical steps will be taken to ensure that personal data will not be kept longer than necessary and that the Bank will comply with all relevant statutory and regulatory requirements in Malaysia concerning the retention of personally identifiable information.
Security assurance
Both you and the Bank play an important role in protecting against online fraud. You should be careful that your bank account details including your user ID, password, Security Device and/or security code are not compromised by ensuring that you do not knowingly or accidentally share, provide or facilitate unauthorised use of it. Do not share your user ID, password, Security Device and/or security code or allow access or use of it/them by others. We endeavour to put in place high standards of security to protect your interests.
You should safeguard your unique user ID, password and Security Code by keeping them secret and confidential. Never write them down or share their details with anyone. The Bank will never ask you for your online banking password, in order to ensure that you are the only person who knows this information. When choosing your unique password and where relevant, your unique user ID for the first time, do not create it/them using easily identifiable information such as your birthday, telephone number or a recognisable part of your name. If you think your user ID, password, Security Device and/or security code has/have been disclosed to a third party, is/are lost or stolen and unauthorised transactions may have been conducted, you are responsible to inform us immediately.
