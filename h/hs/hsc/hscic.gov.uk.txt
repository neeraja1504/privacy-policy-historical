Privacy and cookies - NHS Digital
Summary
A description of the personal information NHS Digital may collect about you as part of our normal business. We want you to understand why we hold and process this information, and your choices. Find out how to request a copy of the information we hold about you.
Personal information
At NHS Digital, we collect personal information for two main reasons:
because of our official role as the safe haven for patient data in England
as part of our normal business
You can read more about our role in health and care, and why we collect personal information from medical records. Those pages contain important information on your choices about your confidential patient information.
This page is about the personal information we may collect about you as part of our normal business. We want you to understand why we hold and process this information, and your choices.
We always collect, hold and process information securely and legally.
Emails and bulletins
We have made the decision to keep sending operational emails and bulletins to addresses already on our lists when GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) comes into force. This is because the information we send is important and helps health and care in England.
Lots of our emails contain technical updates or alerts and it may harm the health and care system if we stop sending these. We consider this legitimate interest.
Every email you receive will have an option on it to remove yourself (unsubscribe) from the list. If you get emails that you do not want, email us at enquiries@nhsdigital.nhs.uk or call us on 0300 303 5678 and tell us what you want to unsubscribe from, and we will remove you from that list.
When you sign up to one of our mailing lists, we do not pass your email address to any third parties. We only subscribe you to the list you have signed up for, and do not use your address to subscribe you to other lists.
Email sent from our contact management software
In messages from our mailing lists, we automatically add a piece of code that requests a small image from our web servers. When a reader opens the email, the image is downloaded. This allows us to monitor how many of the emails we send are opened. We only use it in summary form, for example ‘2,000 people opened the message’.
By default, most email software will be configured to not download the image.
