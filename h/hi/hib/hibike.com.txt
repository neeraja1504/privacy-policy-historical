Data protection declaration
Thank you for your interest in our online shop. The protection of your privacy is very important to us. Below we inform you in detail about the handling of your data.
1. Access data and hosting
You can visit our website without providing any personal information. Each time a website is called up, the web server automatically saves a so-called server log file which, for example, contains the name of the requested file, your IP address, date and time of the call, the amount of data transmitted and the requesting provider (access data) and documents the call. These access data are evaluated exclusively for the purpose of ensuring trouble-free operation of the site and improving our offer. Pursuant to Article 6, paragraph 1, sentence 1, letter f GDPR, this serves to safeguard our legitimate interests in a correct presentation of our offer, which predominate within the scope of a balancing of interests. All access data will be deleted no later than seven days after the end of your visit to the site.

Processing on other servers only takes place in the framework described here.

2. Data collection and use for contract processing and when opening a customer account
We collect personal data when you voluntarily provide it to us in connection with your order, when contacting us (e.g. via contact form or e-mail) or when opening a customer account. Mandatory fields are marked as such, since in these cases we require the data for contract processing, or for processing your contact or opening of the customer account, and you cannot complete the order and/or the account opening or can not send the contact without their information. Which data is collected can be seen from the respective input forms. We use the data provided by you in accordance with Article 6, paragraph 1, sentence 1, letter b GDPR for contract processing and processing your enquiries. After complete processing of the contract or deletion of your customer account, your data will be restricted for further processing and deleted after expiry of the storage periods under tax and commercial law, unless you have expressly consented to further use of your data or we reserve the right to use data beyond this, which is permitted by law and about which we inform you in this declaration. The deletion of your customer account is possible at any time and can take place either via a message to the contact possibility described below or via a function intended for it in the customer account.
3. Data transfer
In order to fulfil the contract in accordance with Article 6, paragraph 1, sentence 1, letter b GDPR, we pass on your data to the shipping company commissioned with the delivery, insofar as this is necessary for the delivery of ordered goods. Depending on which payment service provider you select in the order process, we pass on the payment data collected for the processing of payments to the credit institution commissioned with the payment and, if applicable, to payment service providers commissioned by us or to the selected payment service. In some cases, the selected payment service providers also collect this data themselves if you create an account there. In this case, you must log in to the payment service provider with your access data during the ordering process. The data protection declaration of the respective payment service provider applies in this respect.
We use payment service providers based in a country outside the European Union. The transmission of personal data to this company only takes place within the scope of the necessity to fulfil the contract.
4. E-mail newsletter and postal advertising

You can unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time and either by sending a message to the contact option described below or via a link provided for this purpose in the newsletter. After deregistration, we delete your e-mail address unless you have expressly consented to further use of your data or we reserve the right to use data beyond this, which is permitted by law and about which we inform you in this declaration.
E-mail advertising without registration for the newsletter and your right of objection

This serves to protect our legitimate interests in an advertising approach to our customers, which outweigh our interests.
You can object to this use of your e-mail address at any time by sending a message to the contact option described below or via a link provided for this purpose in the advertising mail, without incurring any costs other than the transmission costs according to the basic rates.

5. Use of data for payment processing
Hire purchase
When selecting the payment method "hire purchase" and granting the data protection consent required for this in accordance with Article 6, paragraph 1, sentence 1, letter a GDPR, personal data (first name, surname, address, e-mail, telephone number, date of birth, IP address, gender) together with data required for transaction processing (article, invoice amount, due dates, total amount, invoice number, taxes, currency, order date and order time) will be transmitted to our partner Santander Consumer Bank AG, Santander-Platz 1, 41061 MÃ¶nchengladbach for purposes of processing this payment method.
To verify the identity or creditworthiness of the customer, our partner carries out inquiries and information with publicly accessible databases and credit bureaus. The providers from whom information and, if applicable, creditworthiness information is obtained on the basis of mathematical-statistical procedures, as well as further details on the processing of your data after transmission to our partner Santander Consumer Bank AG, please refer to its data protection declaration, which you can find here: https://www.santander.de/privatkunden/service-kontakt/datenschutz/
Our partner Santander Consumer Bank AG uses the information received on the statistical probability of non-payment for a balanced decision on the establishment, implementation or termination of the contractual relationship. You have the opportunity to express your views by contacting our partner Santander Consumer Bank AG and to challenge the decision.
The consent to the transfer of data given in the order process can be revoked at any time, even without giving reasons, with effect for the future.
Credit card purchase
When selecting the payment method "credit card" and granting the necessary data protection consent required for this in accordance with Article 6, paragraph 1, sentence 1, letter a GDPR, personal data (e-mail address, country of delivery of the order) together with data required for transaction processing (total amount, invoice number, taxes, currency, order date and order time) will be transmitted to our partner SIX Payment Services (Europe) S.A. (10, Rue Gabriel Lippmann, L-5365 Munsbach, Luxembourg) for the purpose of processing this type of payment.
For statistical risk assessment purposes, our partner sends the e-mail address and the country of delivery to Fraugster Ltd. (Engeldamm 64b, 10179 Berlin, Germany). On the basis of the results of the risk assessment, SIX Payment Services decides whether the customer must undergo the 3D Secure procedure, which may achieve a reversal of liability of the credit card payment in order to relieve us of the risk of non-payment. This risk assessment has no effect on the availability of the payment method "credit card", it only serves to make the payment process easier for the customer.
