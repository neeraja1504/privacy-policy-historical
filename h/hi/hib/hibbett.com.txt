Ads and Information About You
Data about your activities online is being collected on our Platform for use in providing advertising tailored to your individual interests.  We may use third parties such as network advertisers and ad exchanges to serve advertisements across the Internet and may use third party analytics service providers to evaluate and provide us and/or third parties with information about the use of these ads on third party websites and viewing of ads and of our content.  Third parties may offer you a choice as to whether or not to have your information collected for that purpose.  This section of the Privacy Policy provides details and explains how to exercise that choice.
You may see certain ads on our Platform and/or on other third-party websites across the Internet because we participate in advertising networks administered by third parties.  These networks track your online activities over time and across third party websites by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of the tracking technologies described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, and they use this information to show you advertisements (including our ads) that are tailored to your individual interests.  The information they collect includes information about your visits to our Platform, such as the pages you have viewed.  These third-party tracking technologies may be set to, among other things: (a) help deliver advertisements to you that you might be interested in; (b) prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times; and (c) understand the usefulness to you of the advertisements that have been delivered to you.  You acknowledge and agree that associated technology may access and use your device and may set or change settings on your device in connection with the associated operations.  Note that any images (or any other parts of content) served by third parties in association with third-party ads or other content may act as web beacons, which enable third parties to carry out the previously described activities.
This collection and ad targeting may take place both on our Platform and on third-party websites that participate in the ad network, such as websites that feature advertisements delivered by the ad network.  This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.  We and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as a DoubleClick cookie) together to report how your ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to our Platform.  To learn more about how to opt out of Google’s use of cookies, visit the Google’s Ads Settings, here .   To learn more about how to opt out of DoubleClick’s use of cookies, visit the DoubleClick opt-out page, here .
As explained elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, third-party tracking technologies are not controlled by us, even if they use our technology to help store or collect data.  Statements regarding our practices do not apply to the methods for collecting information used by these third-party advertisers and others or the use of the information that such third parties collect.  The relevant third party’s terms of service, privacy policy, permissions, notices and choices should be reviewed regarding their collection, storage and sharing practices.  We make no representations regarding the policies or practices of third-party advertisers or advertising networks or exchanges or related third parties.  Further, while we may use a variety of companies to serve advertisements on the website, you may wish to visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices, which provides information regarding this practice by Network Advertising Initiative (“ NAI ”) members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including the “opt-out” procedures of NAI members.  Opting out of one or more NAI members only means that those NAI members no longer will be allowed under their own rules to deliver targeted content and/or ads to you, which will affect this and other sites, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads.  Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different device or change web browsers, your NAI opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective.  Additional information is available on the NAI’s website accessible by the above link.  You may also be able to opt-out of receiving third-party behavioral ads by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance (“ DAA ”) website at http://www.aboutads.info/choices.  Similar limitations may apply to the DAA opt-out.  We are not responsible for effectiveness of or compliance with any third-parties’ opt-out options.
Does Your Platform Include Links To Third-Party Content, Sites, and/or Apps?
For your convenience, our Platform may contain content, links, or apps that are supplied by a third party and may direct you to a third party website.  The presence of any such content, links, or apps that appear on our website or other parts of our Platform should not be deemed to imply that we endorse or have an affiliation with the associated third party website.  We are not responsible for the data collection, privacy practices, or the content of such other websites.  We encourage you to review the separate privacy policies of each website that you visit.
How Do I Change My Personal Preferences?
You are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of the information you submit to us, such as your contact information provided as part of registration or a transaction.
You can generally access contact information and user preferences that you provide to us by logging into your account and accessing “My Account.”  To help protect your privacy and security, we will take steps we consider reasonable to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.
You may cancel or modify our email marketing communications you receive from us by following the instructions contained within our promotional emails.  This will not affect subsequent subscriptions and if your opt-out is limited to certain types of emails the opt-out will be so limited.  Subsequent or different subscriptions will be unaffected.  Please note that we reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to your account or use of our Platform, such as administrative and Platform-related announcements and these transactional account messages may be unaffected if you choose to opt-out from receiving our marketing communications.
If you have any questions about the Privacy Policy or practices described in it, you should contact us by writing to Hibbett via U.S. Certified Mail, Return Receipt Requested, at 2700 Milan Court, Birmingham, Alabama  35211, ATTN: Chief Privacy Officer, or by calling us at (844) 362-4422.  We will make good faith efforts to make requested changes in our then active databases as soon as reasonably practicable (but we may retain prior information as business records).  Please note that it is not always possible to completely remove or delete all of your information from our databases and that residual data may remain on backup media or for other reasons.
Can My Data Be Transferred to the United States?
Our Platform is operated in the United States and intended for users located in the United States.  If you are located outside of the United States, please be aware that information we collect, including personal information, will be transferred to, and processed, stored and used in the United States.  The data protection laws in the United States may differ from those of the country in which you are located, and your personal information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in the United States according to laws of the United States.  By using the Platform or providing us with any information, you consent to the transfer to the United States, and processing, usage, sharing and storage of your information, including personal information, in the United States as set forth in this Privacy Policy.

How Is My Personal Information Protected?
We take the security of the information you provide seriously.  We work to prevent unauthorized access and maintain data accuracy by employing security measures intended to deter unauthorized access to your information.  We use security measures, including physical, administrative and technical safeguards that we consider commercially reasonable and appropriate to protect the information you provide to us.  While we implement these security measures, you should be aware that 100% security is not always possible and, as such, we disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, quiet enjoyment, and quality of information, title and non-infringement, and you waive all claims therefor.
What About Children’s Personal Information?
Hibbett recognizes the importance of protecting privacy where children are involved.  As such, we do not knowingly collect personal information online from children under the age of 13 unless we first obtain permission from the child’s parent or legal guardian.  In the event we become aware that we have collected personal information from any child under the age of 13 without parental consent, we will dispose of that information in accordance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) and other applicable laws and regulations.  If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child under the age of 13 has provided us with personal information without parental consent required by COPPA, we ask that you  email privacy@hibbett.com, write to us via U.S. Certified Mail, Return Receipt Requested, to Hibbett Sporting Goods, Inc., at 2700 Milan Court, Birmingham, Alabama  35211, ATTN: Chief Privacy Officer, or call Hibbett Customer Service at (844) 362-4422.

We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy from time to time.  Any changes will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Privacy Policy, and your use of our Platform indicates your consent to the Privacy Policy posted at the time of use.  However, we will not use your previously collected personal information in a manner materially different than represented at the time it was collected without your consent.  To the extent any provision of this Privacy Policy is found by a competent tribunal to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be severed to the extent necessary for the remainder to be valid and enforceable.
