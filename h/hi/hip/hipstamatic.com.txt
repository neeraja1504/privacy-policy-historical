We encourage you to review the privacy statements of any other service provider from whom you request services.
We may use web beacons in connection with e-mails sent to Users, to let us know whether and when the email was opened. No Personally Identifiable Information is transmitted through web beacons.
Confidentiality and Security
We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.

If you have any questions about security on our Website, you can send us an email at privacypolicy@Hipstamatic.com.
We limit access to Personally Identifiable Information about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with Personally Identifiable Information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.
