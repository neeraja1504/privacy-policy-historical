HIREBRIDGE PRIVACY POLICY
Last update: February 6, 2019
Hirebridge is committed to respecting your online privacy and recognize your need for appropriate protection and management of any personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") you share with us.
Personal Information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, a home or other physical address and an email address or other contact information, whether at work or at home. In general, you can visit Hirebridge's Web pages without telling us who you are or revealing any Personal Information about yourself.
If you choose to provide us with your Personal Information to us via our website, we may transfer that Information within Hirebridge or to Hirebridge's third-party service providers, across borders, and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world.

Some of our Web pages utilize "cookies" and other tracking technologies. A "cookie" is a small text file that may be used, for example, to collect information about Web site activity. Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them. Hirebridge only uses cookies to store session tokens, which do not contain any personally identifiable information, and expire after 1 day.
You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser, but please note that if you choose to erase or block your cookies, you will need to re-enter your original user ID and password to gain access to certain parts of the Web site. Tracking technologies may record information such as Internet domain and host names; Internet protocol (IP) addresses; browser software and operating system types; clickstream patterns; and dates and times that our site is accessed. Our use of cookies and other tracking technologies allows us to improve our Web site and your Web experience. We may also analyze information that does not contain Personal Information for trends and statistics.

You may choose whether or not to provide Personal Information to Hirebridge. The notice we intend to provide where Hirebridge collects Personal Information on the Web should help you to make this choice. If you choose not to provide the Personal Information we request, you can still visit most of Hirebridge Web sites, but you may be unable to access certain options, offers, and services that involve our interaction with you. If you chose to have a relationship with Hirebridge such as a contractual or
other business relationship or partnership, we will naturally continue to contact you in connection with that business relationship.

Wherever your Personal Information may be held within Hirebridge or on its behalf, we intend to take reasonable and appropriate steps to protect the Personal Information that you share with us from unauthorized access or disclosure.
Access/Accuracy
To the extent that you do provide us with Personal Information, Hirebridge wishes to maintain accurate Personal Information. Where we collect Personal Information from you on the Web, our goal is to provide a means of contacting Hirebridge should you need to update or correct that Information. If for any reason those means are unavailable or inaccessible, you may send updates and corrections about your Personal Information to privacy@hirebridge.com and we will make reasonable efforts to incorporate the changes in your Personal Information that we hold as soon as practicable.

Hirebridge does not intend to transfer Personal Information without your consent to third parties who are not bound to act on Hirebridge's behalf unless such transfer is legally required. Similarly, it is against Hirebridge's policy to sell Personal Information collected online without consent.
