privacy policy Last revised: March , 2014
Our commitment to privacy.
Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy, we have provided this notice explaining our online information practices and procedures
Why we collect Personal information
We collect your personal information because it helps us deliver a superior level of customer service. It enables us to give you convenient access to our products and services and focus on categories of greatest interest to you
The information we collect
We use the information we collect, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We will not use the information collected to market directly to that person.
Cookies and other technologies
As is standard practice on many websites, Hire Wordpress Experts uses “cookies” and other technologies to help us understand which parts of our websites are the most popular, where our visitors are going, and how much time they spend there. We use cookies and other technologies to study traffic patterns on our website, to make it even more rewarding as well as to study the effectiveness of our customer communications. And we use cookies to customize your experience and provide greater convenience each time you interact with us.
Changes to this privacy policy
Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent, and we expect most such changes will be minor. Regardless, we will post any Privacy Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of Privacy Policy changes).
Voluntary customer surveys
We may periodically conduct both business and personal customer surveys. We encourage our customers to participate in these surveys because they provide us with valuable information that helps us to improve the quality of our services as well as to develop new services and products. Your response will not be used for any purpose other than evaluating our services and quality of our products.
Information security and notification.
Because no data transmission over the Internet is completely secure, and no system of physical or electronic security is impenetrable, Service Provider cannot guarantee the security of the information you send to us or the security of our servers or databases, and by using the Website you agree to assume all risk in connection with the information sent to us or collected by us when you use the Website. In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you. If notification is appropriate, we may notify you by e-mail (provided we have your e-mail address).
