Privacy Policy - Hindu Janajagruti Samiti
1. Our philosophy and approach
1. Involving like-minded organisations, associations and individuals in its different campaigns. The main intention is to create awareness among Hindus in the process.
2. The activities undertaken by the HJS comprises curbing denigration taking place through various mediums, advertisements, theatrical performances; curbing malpractices prevalent in public festivals; curbing degradation of Religious leaders and Saints, to provide religious education to Hindus, to curb conversion of Hindus, etc.
3. Any act that harms the interests of Hindu Dharma is notified to the society by creating public awareness regarding it and trying to stop it by lawful means. In such situations, the offenders are made aware of the harmful act committed by them. As a result, persons, organisations or business houses associated with such acts realise their mistake and accept it, thereby stopping such acts. If they don’t accept their mistake after being intimated, then a written memorandum is handed over to them. If they do not pay any heed thereafter too, then the HJS adopts lawful measures such as organising protest marches, staging demonstrations, lodging police complaints, informing the Government, spreading such information through press conferences, seeking judicial help for justice, etc.
4. The HJS launches online protest campaigns against the concerned through its website www.hindujagruti.org. It also gives publicity to such protest campaigns through ‘Sanatan Prabhat’s’ periodicals, other newspapers and news channels to create public awareness.
5. The Samiti is very prompt in its action against any incident regarding hurting of religious sentiments.
6. Samartha Ramdas Swami has said that, Every act one undertakes and every agitation one stages has potential and will succeed provided God’s will is invoked there of. As per this saying, the HJS, on the basis of divine support, makes righteous efforts as expected by Dharma. That is how each of its agitation is successful and beneficial to the society at large.
Blessings of Saints – The campaigns and activities of the HJS have got overwhelming success and have proved to be very beneficial to the society, the reason being that they are backed by the blessings of Saints and divine energy of God.
