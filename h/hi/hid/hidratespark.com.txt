WHAT INFORMATION DOES HIDRATE COLLECT?
Information We Collect Through the Service
Activating a Device. When activating a Hidrate Device, you will be asked to download the Hidrate App  and enter information about yourself, such as height, date of birth, weight, activity level and gender. We use this information to personalize your recommended hydration goal. THE RECOMMENDED HYDRATION GOAL IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. ONLY A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL CAN ADVISE YOU OF YOUR PERSONAL HYDRATION NEEDS.  You can also manually set your hydration goal and we will collect that information.
App. When you use the Service on your mobile device through our App, we may collect your phone number and the unique device ID number.Creating an Account. If you want to access data collected by your Device, you must create a Hidrate account (“Account”). When you create a Hidrate account, in addition to the information above, we ask for your email address and password. Your email address will be your Hidrate user name, which you will use to log-into your Account. Not to worry, we do not display your email address to other users. Instead, others will see the name or nickname you enter in your profile settings.
You can also create your Hidrate Account by signing in using your Facebook or other social networking site (“SNS”) account. We will ask permission to access basic information from that SNS, account, such as your name, profile picture, and friends list. You can stop sharing your SNS account information with us at any time by turning off the connection through the App.  Any information that we collect from your Facebook or other SNS account may depend on the privacy settings you have with that SNS, so please consult the SNS’s privacy and data practices.
Connecting with Friends. To help you stay motivated on your hydration journey, Hidrate lets you add friends who are already Hidrate users or invite friends who have not yet joined. The Service allows you to link your Facebook or other SNS account to your Account and enables you to allow Hidrate to access your contact list for the purpose of letting you identify friends and contacts who are Hidrate users. Once you have imported your contacts, you can invite your contacts to join Hidrate by sending them a link to join the Service.  You can also share an invitation to your friends via your SNS account if you have linked your SNS account to the Service.  The Service also lets you enter your friends’ email address and send an invitation link to them via email.Information We Collect From the Device. When you sync your Device with the App, we collect the following information from your Device, which tracks detailed information about your hydration habits: the amount of liquid consumed, when consumed, and, if location services are activated, the location of the Device and where you drank from the Device. This information is associated with your Account. Your Device stores this data until you sync and only retains limited data after a sync. Each time a sync occurs, we log data about the transmission. An example of this log data would be the sync time and date, the battery level of the Device, location, and the IP address used when syncing. We will collect and retain any hydration data that you’ve chosen to save to your Account in your history.Linking to Third Party Products and Services. The Service may allow you to link third party products and services to the App, such as Fitbit and Apple Health Kit. If you choose to connect with third party products and services, Hidrate may have access to information from such third party products and services, such as activity data. This data is used to help personalize your hydration goal based on your activity. You may disconnect any connection t turning off the connection through the App. Any data that Hidrate receives from third party products and services will be processed and stored by Hidrate and will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy. This information may be processed in the same ways as any other data that is a part of your Account and is used to enhance your use of the Service.
Reminders. We will collect and store any reminders you create. You can set water reminders through the App by enabling push notifications or the Device light reminder.  You can turning off these reminders at any time through the App.Making Purchases. If you make a purchase on our Site or App, we use the services of Authorize.Net to handle online orders and payments. Hidrate does not process, record or maintain your credit card or bank account information. For more information on how payments are handled, or to understand the data security and privacy afforded such information, please refer to Authorize.Net’s Terms of Service: http://www.authorize.net/company/terms/ and acknowledge Authorize.Net’s Privacy Policy: http://www.authorize.net/company/privacy/. We collect and store your shipping address, name, email address, and any other information that you willingly provide so that we can process your order through our fulfillment partner.
Contacting Us. If you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail or the App, we will collect your name and email address and/or Account information along with any additional information you provide in your request so that we can send you a reply and to improve the overall Service. You can also contact us on public forums sites such as Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram; however, we cannot maintain the privacy of your communication to us if you contact us through these public channels.Location Information. If you have enabled location services on your mobile device, we will collect geolocation information to help personalize your recommended hydration goal based on the humidity, temperature and other conditions of  your location. If you do not want to provide us with your location information, you can deactivate geolocation services on your mobile device. We store this information in your Hidrate account. If you are using a mapping feature, we will send your location information to our mapping service provider so they can display your location on a map. This feature is used so that you can know the last place you synced with your Device to help prevent the loss of Hidrate Devices.
Email Notifications. We will collect your email address if you sign up for email notifications via the Site.
Surveys and Contests. When you participate in one of our surveys, we may collect additional personal information to complete the survey. If you participate in a contest, sweepstakes or other promotion, we will collect any information you provide in connection with that promotion.
Information We Receive from Third Parties.  We may receive personal information from third party sources.  We may add this information to the information we have already collected from you directly via the Service.
Information Collected Automatically via Technology
Cookies.  Like many online services, we use cookies on our Site to collect information.  “Cookies” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing the website.  We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site.    This type of information is collected to make the Site more useful to you and to tailor the experience with us to meet your special interests and needs.  We also use Cookies to identify multiple devices with a single user.
Information Collected by Our Servers.  To make our Site and Service more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) collect information from you, including your browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, and/or a date/time stamp for your visit.
Log Files.  As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.  This information includes IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (“ISP”), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.  We use this information to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users’ movements around the Site, gather demographic information about our user base as a whole, and better tailor our Service to our users’ needs.  For example, some of the information may be collected so that when you visit the Site or the Service again, it will recognize you and the information could then be used to serve advertisements and other information appropriate to your interests.
Pixel Tags. In addition, we use “Pixel Tags” (also referred to as clear Gifs, Web beacons, or Web bugs).  Pixel Tags are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in function to Cookies, that are used to track online movements of Web users.  In contrast to Cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, Pixel Tags are embedded invisibly in Web pages.  Pixel Tags also allow us to send e-mail messages in a format users can read, and they tell us whether e-mails have been opened to ensure that we are sending only messages that are of interest to our users.  We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to a user.
Mobile Services.  We may also collect non-personal information from your mobile device if you have downloaded our App.  This information is generally used to help us deliver the most relevant information to you. Examples of information that may be collected and used include your geographic location, how you use the App, and information about the type of device you use.   In addition, in the event our App crash on your mobile device, we will receive information about your mobile device model software version and device carrier, which allows us to identify and fix bugs and otherwise improve the performance of our App.  This information is sent to us as aggregated information and is not traceable to any individual and cannot be used to identify an individual.
Flash LSOs.  When we post videos, third parties may use local shared objects, known as “Flash Cookies,” to store your preferences for volume control or to personalize certain video features.  Flash Cookies are different from browser Cookies because of the amount and type of data and how the data is stored.  Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash Cookies.  To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash Cookies, click here..
Third Party Analytics and Tracking
How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals.  We do not currently respond to “do not track” signals or other mechanisms that might enable consumers to opt out of tracking on our Website.
Analytics Tools. We use analytics services (including, but not limited to, Google Analytics and Adroll) to help analyze how users use the Site and App. Analytics services use Cookies to collect information such as how often users visit the Site and we use the information to improve our Service. The analytics services’ ability to use and share information collected by them is restricted by their terms of use and privacy policy, which you should refer to for more information about how these entities use this information, and how you can opt-out of their use of such information.
Collection of Information by Advertisers
We may use third parties to serve ads on the Service.  Certain third parties may automatically collect information about your visits to this and other websites, your IP address, your ISP, the browser you use to visit our Website (but not your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number).  They do this by using Cookies or other technologies.  Information collected may be used, among other things, to deliver advertising targeted to your interests and to better understand the usage and visitation of our Website and the other sites tracked by these third parties.  This policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, Cookies or pixel tags in third party ads, and we encourage you to check the privacy policies of advertisers and/or ad services to learn about their use of Cookies and other technologies.  If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click here: http://www.aboutads.info/choices.
