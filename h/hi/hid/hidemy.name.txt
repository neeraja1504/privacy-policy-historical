Privacy Policy
The VPN service “HideMy.name VPN” (“Service“) is operated by inCloak Network Ltd. (“us“, “we“, or “our“)
We value our customers’privacy and believe that it is important for us to share the information about what kind of personal data we collect, process and store.
What is the application of this policy?
The application of this policy extends to our role as a controller with respect to the personal data of our site visitors and service users; in other words, where we establish the objectives and means of that personal data processing.
Regardless of our affiliation with any third-party service or product, this policy does not apply to such third-party affiliates. Our site contains hyperlinks to, and information about, third-party websites. We neither hold ourselves responsible for, nor do we have control over, these third parties’ privacy policies and practices.
You agree to our policy terms by using our website, products or services.
What personal data gets collected and stored when you sign up for our VPN service?
Because we want to maximize your privacy, we only collect the minimum amount of required information – your email address, which is stored in an encrypted mode on servers that are entirely encrypted.
Encryption technology will be used to protect any personal data, including your email address, that gets transferred from your web browser to our web server or the other way around.
We do not request or store your personal information, including your name, IP address or physical addresses. Personal Data within your account, such as your email address, may be used to reach out to you with marketing and promotional material, newsletters, and any other material that might interest you.

You agree to this procedure by signing up for a HideMy.name account.
What information do we process when our customers connect to our VPN service?
A non-persistent log of connection data, that includes customers’ randomly generated username and internally assigned, non-public IP address, is maintained by us for troubleshooting purposes. We safely clear out the troubleshooting log every few hours. To lessen our legal liability, we purposely and strictly do not record any other data. Your browsing behavior is not monitored or recorded by us. It is impossible to log your browsing behavior with our technical backend. All the data you use remains anonymous and not connected to your real, public IP address.
The volume of traffic that you spend during your VPN session gets processed upon the end of each connection in order to update the traffic usage counters. The aggregated amount of monthly data traffic is accounted for in order to maintain a high level of service quality.

This data may include the information about the time, frequency and patterns of your visits, as well as your geographical location and IP address, operating system, browser type and version, referral source, pages viewed, length of visit, and website navigation paths.
