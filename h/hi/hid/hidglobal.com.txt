We will use the aggregate data that we collect internally in order to better understand and assist our customers and to help improve our website and services. We process Personal Data for certain Legitimate Interests, which include some or all of the following:
where the processing enables us to enhance, modify, personalize or otherwise improve our services / communications for the benefit of our customers
to identify and prevent fraud
to enhance the security of our network and information systems
to better understand how people interact with our websites
to provide postal communications which we think will be of interest to you

Whenever we process data for these purposes we will ensure that we always keep your Personal Data rights in high regard and take account of these rights. You have the right to object to this processing if you wish, and if you wish to do so please fill out a request here.

“Legitimate Interests” means HID Global’s interests in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/products and the best and most secure experience.
For example, we have an interest in making sure our marketing is relevant for you, so we may process your information to send you marketing that is tailored to you and your company’s interests.
