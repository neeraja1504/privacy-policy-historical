We may use such aggregate information to help us monetize a Production or for other purposes.

These third parties may only use User information for the purposes of providing services to hitRECord.org and for no other purpose.
Displaying to Other Users. When you upload content to the Site, including RECords and comments, certain Personal Information about you, such as your user name and identifying photo, may – and likely will be – displayed on the Site. Other more sensitive Personal Information, such as your postal address, e-mail address, phone number, or any taxpayer identification information, will NOT be displayed on the Site.

You should therefore be mindful of these types of disclosures when selecting a User name or choosing the photograph to use with your account.
Contributing Artist Profit Pools. If you are a Contributing Artist and a RECord you have uploaded to the Site is included within a monetized Production, then we will post your hitRECord.org User name, your Contributing Artist’s Share, and the amount of money due you when making disclosures about monetized Productions, whether for the purposes of establishing the Contributing Artists’ Shares in the Contributing Artists Profit Pool or when documenting allocations of the Contributing Artists Profit Pool. If you do not wish to have your Personal Information disclosed, then you should not contribute a RECord to the Site.
Marketing. We do not rent, sell, or share your Personal Information with other people or nonaffiliated companies for their direct marketing purposes. We may, however, allow access to other data collected on or through the Site to enable the delivery of online advertising on and through the Site that may be useful, relevant, valuable or otherwise of interest to you. For example, we may target communications to you on behalf of third parties based upon your Personal Information without sharing your Personal Information with a third party. If you respond to such a communication, then the third party may deduce that you meet certain characteristics (e.g., you are a woman between the ages of X and Y). In all cases, hitRECord.org may market its services to you directly.
As Required By Law and Similar Disclosures. We may access, preserve, and disclose your Personal Information, other account information, and content if we believe doing so is required or appropriate to: comply with law enforcement requests and legal process, such as a court order or subpoena; respond to your requests; or protect your, our or others’ rights, property, interests, including with respect to intellectual property or safety.

In such an event, your information may be sold or transferred as part of such a transaction as permitted by law and/or contract.
