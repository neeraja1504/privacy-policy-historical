What Personal Information We Collect and How We Use It
In general, you can visit our Websites without telling us who you are and without giving us any personal information. There are times, however, when we or our partners may need information from you, for instance in order to perform a transaction. In particular, we may collect and process the following information (including Personal Information) about you:
Information you give us. You may give us information about you by filling in forms on HGST Websites or by corresponding with us by phone, e-mail or otherwise. This includes information you provide when you register to use our Websites, subscribe to our services, download white papers and case studies, sign up to webinars, contribute to our chat rooms or forums, apply for jobs, purchase or use our products and/or services, sign up for programs, and when you report a problem with our Websites. The information you give us may include your name, address, e-mail address, phone number, financial and credit card information, resume or curriculum vitae.
We use the information you give to us:
to provide you with the products and services you requested, including support services;
to provide you with information about product and services that we feel may interest you:
to contact you as part of our customer satisfaction surveys or for market research purposes;
to notify you about changes to our services; and
for recruitment purposes, if you have applied for a job with us.
Information we collect automatically. When you visit our Websites, we may automatically collect the following information: technical information, including your IP address, log-in information, browser type and version, time zone setting, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform, information about your visit including the URL clickstream to, through and from our Websites (such as scrolling, clicks and mouse overs), products you viewed or searched for, download errors, length of visits to certain pages and page interaction. We collect information automatically through the use of various technologies, including through "cookies", and this is explained further below.
We use the information we collect automatically:
to administer our Websites for internal operations including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research, statistical and survey purposes;
to ensure that content from our Websites is presented in the most effective manner for you and your devices;
to allow you to participate in interactive features of our services; as part of our effort to keep our Websites safe and secure;
to make suggestions and recommendations to you and other users of our Websites about goods and services that may interest you or them; and
to measure the effectiveness of advertising we and others serve to you and to deliver relevant advertising to you.
Information we receive from other sources. We may receive information about you from third parties we work with such as business partners, sub-contractors in technical payment and delivery services, advertising networks, analytics providers and search information providers.
We use the information that we receive about you from other sources for the same purposes as the information you provide to us and the information that we collect automatically, and in addition in order to help us maintain the accuracy of the information we collect.
If you give us personal information about somebody else, such as a spouse or work colleague, we will assume that you have their permission to do so. You are responsible for obtaining this permission from other people whose personal information you provide to us.
How we Share and Disclose Your Personal Information
We may share your personal information with others, to fulfill your requests and orders, for instance with other parts of HGST, our order fulfillment reseller, business partners, financial institutions, shipping companies, and postal or government authorities (for example, Customs authorities) involved in fulfillment.
We may also share your personal information with advertising networks that require this information to select and serve relevant adverts to you, as well as with analytics and search engine providers who assist us in the improvement of our Websites.
In some cases we use suppliers to collect, use, analyze and otherwise process information (including personal information) on our behalf. We require suppliers with whom we share personal information to handle it in a manner consistent with our policies, and we take steps to ensure that our suppliers preserve the security and confidentiality of personal information that they collect and process on our behalf.
We may use the information that you provide us in connection with a job application or enquiry throughout HGST and its related entities for the purpose of considering your enquiry and application for employment related purposes. Except where you tell us not to, we will keep your personal information for possible future consideration.
We may generally share your personal information with our affiliates globally, and this is further explained in the section on Our Worldwide Practices, below.
In addition, we may process your personal information for the purpose of producing and providing to our partners statistical information (meaning aggregate information that does not identify you personally) about how our customers, collectively, use our Websites and services. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners can understand how often people use their areas, services and our Websites, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal web experience or services experience.
In certain circumstances, we may disclose your personal information to 3rd parties such as law enforcement authorities and agencies, regulatory organization, courts and governmental or other public authorities if we have to or are authorized to do so by law, for example pursuant to judicial or other government requests, subpoenas, warrants, or orders.
Finally, circumstances may arise where, whether for strategic or other business reasons, HGST decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize businesses in some countries. Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personal information to prospective or actual purchasers, or receiving it from sellers. We will seek appropriate protection for personal information disclosed in these types of transactions.
How to Opt In or Opt Out from Direct Marketing
We may use the information you give us on certain HGST Websites for direct marketing purposes to provide product and service requests, offers, updates, newsletters, events, or promotional communications. However, such marketing will be sent in accordance with applicable law, and any marketing preferences you have expressed. We will offer you an opportunity to either opt in to or opt out of such use. There are a few ways to opt in to or opt out of the use of your personal information for direct marketing purposes. For example, at the point of collection of your personal information you may be informed of an opportunity to receive certain communications and be given a choice to opt in or opt out, for instance by providing your personal information and checking or unchecking an opt-in or opt-out box.
