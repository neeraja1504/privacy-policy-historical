* 6.1 _Business Partners:_ We share your personal data with affiliated and unaffiliated business partners as follows:
* To provide you with products and services you have ordered via the Website (e.g. in order to perform reservations via the Website, to arrange rental cars or other ordered services which are provided by business partners, and to help our business partners assessing compliance with travel policies or participation in special rate plans). Such data transfers are based on Art. 6 (1) (b) and/or (f) GDPR.
* to allow us and our business partners, such as our airline, cruise and car rental partners, to deliver advertisements to our shared customers. Such data transfers are based on your consent, Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR.
* to allow our business partners to recognize you when you visit that partner's website or app, or to recognize you as one of their customers when you visit HGV websites or apps so that they may provide more relevant offers to you. We may share your email address with such partners using available security measures that may match it with their own email addresses so that they can send online and email advertisements to you on our behalf. Such data transfers are based on legitimate business interests (Art. 6 (1) (f) or your consent, Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR.
* 6.2 _Buyers:_ As we develop our business, we might sell, buy, restructure or reorganize businesses assets or our Website. In such circumstances, HGV may transfer, sell or assign personal data, to the respective buyers. Such data transfers, depending on the concrete transaction will be based on your consent, Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR or legitimate business interests, Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. To the extent required by applicable law, we will provide further information about the transfer of your personal data in this respect, and explain the rights you have to object such transfer.

Our service providers are contractually obligated to process such data on behalf of HGV under appropriate instructions as necessary for the respective processing purposes and to appropriately protect your personal data. Our service providers may not otherwise process or share your personal data, except as permitted by law. We use service providers to communicate news and deliver promotional and transactional materials to you, including personalized online and mobile advertising. Please also see our [Cookie Statement](https://web.archive.org/web/20190405000728id_/http%3A//www.hiltongrandvacations.com/en/cookie-statement.html) for more information.

7. Cross-Border Data Transfer
7.1 Some of the recipients of your personal data will be located or may have relevant operations outside of your country and the EU, where the data protection laws may provide a different level of protection compared to the laws in your jurisdiction and with regard to which an adequacy decision by the European Commission does not exist.
7.2 The countries which provide an adequate level of data protection from a European data protection law perspective (Art. 45 GDPR) include Andorra, Argentina, Canada (commercial organizations), Faeroe Islands, Guernsey, Israel, Isle of Man, Jersey, New Zealand, Switzerland, and Uruguay. Recipients in the US may be certified under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and thereby recognized as providing an adequate level of data protection from a European data protection law perspective (Art. 45 GDPR).
7.3 We may also provide adequate level of data protection by other means. By way of entering into appropriate data transfer agreements based on Standard Contractual Clauses (2010/87/EC and/or 2004/915/EC) as referred to in Art. 46 (5) GDPR or other adequate means, which are accessible upon request under the contact details provided in Section 3 above, we have established that all other recipients located outside the EEA will provide an adequate level of protection for the Personal Data and that appropriate technical and organizational security measures are in place to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss or alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, and against all other unlawful forms of processing. Any onward transfer (including our affiliates outside the EEA) is subject to appropriate onward transfer requirements as required by applicable law.
8. Storage Period
Your personal data is stored by HGV and/or our service providers, strictly to the extent necessary for the performance of our obligations and strictly for the time necessary to achieve the purposes for which the personal data is collected, in accordance with applicable data protection laws. For example, personal data contained in contracts, communications, and business letters may be subject to statutory retention requirements, which may require retention of up to 10 years. In addition, if a judicial or disciplinary action is initiated, the personal data may be stored until the end of such action, including any potential periods for appeal, and will then be deleted or archived as permitted by applicable law.
9. Your Rights
9.1 If you have declared your consent for any personal data processing activities, you can withdraw this consent at any time with future effect. Such a withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of the processing prior to the consent withdrawal.
9.2 Under the conditions set out under applicable law, you have the following rights (which might be limited under the applicable national data protection law):
a) Right of access: You have the right to obtain from us confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning you is being processed, and, where that is the case, to request access to the personal data. The access information includes â€“ inter alia â€“ the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data concerned, and the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed. You have the right to obtain a copy of the personal data undergoing processing. For additional copies requested by you, we may charge a reasonable fee based on administrative costs.
b) Right to rectification: You have the right to obtain from us the rectification of inaccurate personal data concerning you. Depending on the purposes of the processing, you have the right to have incomplete personal data completed, including by means of providing a supplementary statement.
c) Right to erasure (right to be forgotten): You have the right to ask us to erase your personal data.
d) Right to restriction of processing: You have the right to request the restriction of processing your personal data. In this case, the respective data will be marked and may only be processed by us for certain purposes.
e) Right to data portability: You have the right to receive the personal data concerning you which you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and you have the right to transmit those personal data to another entity without hindrance from us.
f) Right to object:
You have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time to the processing of your personal data by us and we can be required to no longer process your personal data. If you have a right to object and you exercise this right, your personal data will no longer be processed for such purposes by us. Exercising this right will not incur any costs. Such a right to object may not exist, in particular, if the processing of your personal data is necessary to take steps prior to entering into a contract or to perform a contract already concluded.
9.3 In addition to the rights set out above, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with the competent data protection supervisory authority.
