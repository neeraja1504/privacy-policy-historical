What about "cookies" and similar technology?
"Cookies" are pieces of information that a website transfers as a very small text file to your computer´s hard disk. They are used for record-keeping purposes. "Cookies" can make the site more useful by storing information about your preferences on the site. "Cookies" in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user´s computer.  We and our third party service providers may also use pixel tags (also known as web beacons, web bugs, and clear GIFs) on our site and in emails. A pixel tag is a nearly invisible pixel-sized graphic image on a webpage or in an email message.
As an example, after registering at a website, you may be asked to login each time you returned. By choosing the auto-login option, cookie technology can identify your computer as your computer, and you can be logged-in automatically. There would be no need to remember the login name or the password.
The information we and our third party service providers collect through cookies, pixel tags and similar technology includes the following: your interactions with our Sites and with our advertisements; the time of your visit to our site; items you put into your shopping cart and whether you purchase any or all of those items; confirmation when you open email from us, including the time you open the email and whether you click on any links in the email; sites you visit after visiting our site.
Personal information may be collected directly by us through our social media pages, such as Facebook, Twitter LinkedIn or others.  Personal information may also be collected by the social media site hosting our social media pages. Our Privacy Policy does not cover the privacy and security practices of the social media sites on which Hilti has its social media pages.
We contract with third party advertising companies to tailor online advertising to be directed to you on other websites.  These third party advertising companies place, use, or rely on technology, such as cookies and pixel tags, to obtain information about your interactions with our site as well as with other websites. This information helps us select advertising to serve to you and where to serve it based on your experience on our site and other sites that you visit.
