Integrated / Third Party Services
Other automated technologies that High-Hits uses include the use of third party widgets and plugins such as Facebook Like buttons and pop up ad technologies to ensure you see the advert once per session etc. That information is subject to the privacy policies of those providers.
How We Use the Information We Collect
We use the information that we collect in a variety of ways in providing the Service and operating our business, including the following:
Operations
We use account information (Name, Username, Password & Internet Protocol Address) to enable use to provide a Members Area from where you can manage your own advertising and store the information about what adverts you have purchased and have available including account balances.
Improvements
We use the information regarding transactions (Date, Time, Email Address Used, Purchased Item Information and Payment Method Used) to process your transactions and to keep a log of what you have purchased in the past in case of any discrepancies you may have about what you have purchased. We also use this information to enable us to see what items sell well and improve on our best products and offerings.
Communications
We use your email address to validate and confirm that you are the account holder and so that you can click the opt in verification link to give your approval of us contacting you via email. This helps us keep you informed, send details of purchases for your records and also to verify the account holder for security reasons. We also promote other products and services (both supplied or provided by us or by third parties) to you via email but we do so from emails sent directly from our system only and do not share or distribute your email address with others. (See the "Linking to other websites" section below)
Cookies and Tracking Technologies
Automated cookies and web beacons are used for tracking purposes to see from where Members have come and to keep session information to make sure that certain ads are only delivered once per session and not every page load.
To Whom We Disclose Information
We do not share your email address with any third parties and never sell member information. We do allow third parties to advertise using our services and we do promote other services to you via email but all promotions are delivered from our systems and no personal information is shared with them from us. You may share information with them if you join their site or purchase their services.
Service Providers
We may provide information including Name, Email Address and Internet Protocol (IP) Addresses to both payment processors and or law enforcement if requested to do so by law and or the terms of purchasing using their services to help with any investigation or information request they need to conduct lawful business.

Any information collected by third party apps or plugins including but not limited to Facebook Like buttons etc is picked up from your actions and not from our system by way you interact with such services and therefore you are using their service and under their privacy policies.
