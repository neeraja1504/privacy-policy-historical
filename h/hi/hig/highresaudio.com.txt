Here are the types of information we gather
Information you give us: we receive and store any information you enter on our website or give us in any other way. You can choose not to provide certain information that will mean that you might not be able to take advantage certain site features.
Automatic information: we receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many websites, we use "cookies" and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses HIGHRESAUDIO. A number of companies offer utilities designed to help you visit websites anonymously. We will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience at HIGHRESAUDIO if we cannot recognize you, but we want you to be aware that these tools exist.

How we use Cookies and other automatic tracking systems
Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize you. When you visit our Website or click through hyperlinks appearing thereon, or use one or more of our services, we may use an industry-wide technology called "cookies" which stores certain information on your computer and which will allow us to customise your experience to better match your interests and preferences or simply facilitate your signing-in to use the services. Most browsers will allow you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block acceptance of cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. Please refer to your browser instructions or help screen to learn more about these functions. Please note, however, that if you set your browser to block acceptance of cookies, you will not be able to use the HIGHRESAUDIO service or enter our Website.
The Help menu on the menu bar of most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie and how to disable cookies altogether. If you do leave cookies turned on, be sure to sign off when you finish using a shared computer.
You can always choose not to provide information and not to accept Cookies, even though it might be needed to make a purchase or to take advantage of certain site features.
As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exiting pages, operating system, date/time stamp and clickstream data.
We use this information which does not track individual users, to analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. HIGHRESAUDIO will not use the information collected in this way to market directly to that person.
In some of our email messages we use "click-through URLs" linked to content on www.highresaudio.com. When a customer clicks one of these URLs, they pass through our web server before arriving at the destination page. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of customer communications.
Google Analytics
The website www.highresaudio.com uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc. (https://support.google.com/analytics?hl=en#topic=3...). Google Analytics uses "cookies", text files that are stored on your computer and allow an analysis of the use of the website. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website (including your IP address, which is, however, before saving using the method _anonymizeIp (anonymously), so that they can no longer be assigned to a port) to a Google server in the U.S. and stored there. Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other website activity and internet related services. In addition, Google may also transfer this information to third parties, unless required by law or if third parties process the information on behalf of Google. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser, we point out however, that you can use in this case not all the features of this website. By using this site you agree to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner described above and for the purpose. You may object to the collection of data through Google Analytics, effective for the future by installing an add-on deactivation (http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de) for your browser.
YouTube
Our website uses plugins from YouTube, which is operated by Google. The operator of the pages is YouTube LLC, 901 Cherry Ave., San Bruno, CA 94066, USA. If you visit one of our pages featuring a YouTube plugin, a connection to the YouTube servers is established. Here the YouTube server is informed about which of our pages you have visited. If you're logged in to your YouTube account, YouTube allows you to associate your browsing behavior directly with your personal profile. You can prevent this by logging out of your YouTube account.
YouTube is used to help make our website appealing. This constitutes a justified interest pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO. Further information about handling user data, can be found in the data protection declaration of YouTube under https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy.
Social media
Share content via plugins (Facebook, Google+1, Twitter, etc.)
The content on our pages can be shared on other social networks like Facebook, Twitter, or Google+. This page uses the eRecht24 Safe Sharing Tool. This tool establishes direct contact between the networks and users only after users click on one of these buttons.
This tool does not automatically transfer user data to the operators of these platforms. If users are logged into one or more of the social networks, the Like, +1, and Share buttons for Facebook, Google+1, Twitter, etc. will display an information window in which the user can edit the text before it is sent.
Our users can share the content of this page on social networks without their providers creating profiles of users' surfing behavior.
Business transfers:
As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores, subsidiaries or business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that HIGHRESAUDIO or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
Protection of HIGHRESAUDIO and others:
We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with law, to enforce or apply our Terms & Conditions and other agreements or to protect the rights, property or safety of HIGHRESAUDIO, our users or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in a way that is contrary to the commitments made in this Privacy Notice. With your consent, other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.
Whenever we transfer personal information to countries outside of the European Economic Area in the course of sharing information as set out above, we will ensure that the information is transferred in accordance with this Privacy Notice and as permitted by the UK's Data Protection Act and and EU Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications (May 25th 2018).
