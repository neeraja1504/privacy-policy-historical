Information Collected and How it is Used
Information collected if you only browse this site.
If you do nothing during your visit to our Web site but browse, read pages, or download information, we will gather and store certain information about your visit. This information does not identify you personally. We automatically collect and store the following information about your visit:
The Internet Protocol Address and domain name used. The Internet Protocol address is a numerical identifier assigned either to your Internet service provider or directly to your computer. We use the Internet Protocol Address to direct Internet traffic to you. This address can be translated to determine the domain name of your service provider (for example, com or yourschool.edu );
The type of browser and operating system you used;
The date and time you visited this site;
The Web pages or services you accessed at this site; and
The Web site you visited prior to coming to this Web site.
The information we automatically collect or store is logged and used by Highline College only to improve the content of our Web services and to help us understand how people are using our services. Highline College analyzes the Web site logs to determine how our Web site is being used, so that we may continually improve the site’s usefulness to the public.
What we collect if you volunteer information.
If during your visit to our Web site you participate in a survey, send an e-mail, or perform some other transaction on-line, the following additional information will be collected:
The e-mail address, and contents of e-mail, for those who communicate with us via e-mail.

Personal Information and Choice
You may choose whether to provide personal information online.
Personal information is information about a person that is readily identifiable to that specific individual. Personal information includes such things as an individual’s name, address, and phone number. A domain name or Internet Protocol address is not considered personal information.
We collect no personal information about you unless you voluntarily provide it to us by sending us e-mail, participating in a survey, or completing an on-line form. You may choose not to contact us by e-mail, participate in a survey or to provide any personal information using an online form. Your choice to not participate in these activities will not impair your ability to browse the Highline College Web site and read or download most information provided on the site.
Choosing not to participate in these activities may impair your ability to use on-line student services, participate in surveys, and participate in on-line instructional activities. On-line student services may be conducted using Touch-tone registration, mail, or telephone, as described in the section below on that specific service. Information about participating in surveys is available by contacting the office sponsoring the survey (identified on each individual survey), though some surveys will not be available off-line. Information about participating in instructional activities off-line is available by contacting the instructor, though some instructional activities may not be available off-line.
If personal information is requested on the Web site or volunteered by the user, state law and the federal Privacy Act of 1974 may protect it. However, this information is a public record once you provide it, and may be subject to public inspection and copying if not protected by federal or state law.
If you believe that your personal information is being used for a purpose other than what was intended when submitted, you may contact the Public Records Officer as shown in the Contact Information section of this statement.
Highline College web site is a general audience site and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. Users are cautioned that the collection of personal information requested from or volunteered by children online or by e-mail will be treated the same as information given by an adult, and may be subject to public access.

Public Records Access
The Public Records Act [RCW 42.56] was created in 1972 subsequent to the Federal Freedom of Information Act [5 U.S.C. 552] with the belief that the public should have access to information concerning the operation of government.
The State of Washington recognizes that “The people of this state do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies that serve them. The people, in delegating authority, do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know. The people insist on remaining informed so that they may maintain control over the instruments that they have created.” [RCW 42.56.030]
More information on the legislation behind the Public Records Act, visit http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=42.56.
What is a Public Record?
A public record includes any writing containing information relating to the conduct of government or the performance of any governmental or proprietary function prepared, owned, used, or retained by any state or local agency regardless of physical form or characteristics. [RCW 42.56.010]
How do I file a Public Records Request?
See Public Records Request.

Additionally, Congress requires student information to be released to military recruiters if officially requested.
