Security
We take every precaution to protect our users’ information. When you submit sensitive information online, your information is protected both online and off-line.
When our registration form asks you to enter sensitive information such as credit card info, that information is encrypted and protected with state of the art encryption software, Secure Socket Layers (SSLs). While on a secure page, such as your order form and during the checkout process, a lock icon appears on the bottom of your web browser. When you are not on a secure page no lock icon will appear.
While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information (like your credit card information) online, We also do everything in our power to protect our users information off-line. All of our users information and not just the information noted above is restricted in our offices. Only our employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to some personally identifiable information as your shipping address for shipping purposes… All employees are fully informed about our security and privacy practices and updated as new policies are added or revised. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment under restricted access.
