Privacy Policy - HigherEdJobs
This privacy policy applies to http://www.higheredjobs.com owned and operated by Internet Employment Linkage ("We", "Us", "HigherEdJobs.com"). This privacy policy describes how Internet Employment Linkage collects and uses the personally identifiable information you provide on our website: http://www.higheredjobs.com. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personally identifiable information and how you can access and update this information.
If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our Chief Operating Officer, Andrew Hibel, at privacy@higheredjobs.com.
PRIVACY PHILOSOPHY
Internet Employment Linkage Inc., publisher of HigherEdJobs.com, has created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to keeping personally identifiable information private. Our data collection policies allow you to choose how much information you provide us and how we use the information you have shared. It is our intent to use this information to help further your success in seeking or filling a position in the field of higher education through the use of our website.
THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT
A. Aggregate Information. You can always browse the Public Site and search for posted positions without providing any personally identifiable information to HigherEdJobs.com. We gather general information about the number of users browsing the website, the number of users who view certain posted positions, and how users navigate through our Web Site. This information is collected only in the aggregate. We use this information to provide aggregated statistical feedback to the institutions posting positions on our website, to publicize our website and to further develop our website to maximize the benefits realized by our users.
B. Personally Identifiable Information. HigherEdJobs.com collects personally identifiable information when you register for a personal account through HigherEdJobs.com, create a Resume Profile and when you elect to receive information from us through Insider Update or other similar "opt-in" services we may provide. "Opt-in" services are only offered when the user purposefully checks a box or another method of indicating their specific intention of being included for the service so provided. When you create a user ID and password, we collect your name, e-mail address, state and country of residence, academic/administrative focus, years in higher education and years of work experience. We may also request other information such as your ZIP Code, career level, highest degree earned, salary level and professional affiliations. Any information you provide to HigherEdJobs.com when registering for a personal account is maintained and accessible only by HigherEdJobs.com. We use this information in the aggregate for demographic purposes. We may use that information to e-mail you information about maintenance schedules, new institutional subscribers information, as well as special promotions and other general updates from HigherEdJobs.com or third parties that may be relevant to you and your search for a position in higher education. HigherEdJobs.com provides you with the opportunity to opt-out of these types of communications. If you choose to receive these types of communications at the time of registration or by opting in for a particular service, and later decide you no longer want to receive them, simply follow the opt-out procedures contained on the website. WE DO NOT SELL OR OTHERWISE SHARE ANY OF YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION WITH ANY THIRD PARTY OTHER THAN IS OUTLINED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY.
We post customer testimonials on our website which may contain personally identifiable information such as the customer's name. We do obtain the customer's consent prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial. If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, you can contact us at privacy@higheredjobs.com.
C. Resume Center. If you register for a personal HigherEdJobs account, you will have the option of posting a form of your resume on the Restricted Site. We request certain personally identifiable information in order for you to post your resume, such as your name and address, e-mail address and experience working in higher education. We include this information, when and only if you so elect, in a database for institutional and other paying subscribers to search for potential candidates online. In addition, you have the ability to draft a personal resume and cover letter in the resume textbox. There are two primary ways you can use the Resume Center:
You can create and store your resume on our database, but not allow it to be searched by any institutions of higher education or other employer-subscribers. Not allowing your resume to be searchable means that you can use it to apply for a position online, but it will not be searchable through our Resume Database.
You can store your resume in our database and allow it to be searched by universities and employers that subscribe for access to our resume database. You may elect to have your personal contact information disclosed to universities and employers searching our database, or not have any personal contact information disclosed. You may remove your resume from our searchable database at any time. However, university and other subscribers who have paid for access to the database may have retained a copy of your resume in their own files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use, or privacy of resumes, nor any information disclosed on your resume or cover letter posted on our website. Please note that once you create a resume online and permit it to be searched, all information contained in your resume and cover letter can be collected and used by our paying subscribers. This may result in unsolicited messages from third parties, for which Internet Employment Linkage, Inc. is not responsible.
D. Tracking Technologies. We Internet Employment Linkage and our partners use technologies such as cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, track users' movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level.

This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. We do not link this automatically collected data to other information we collect about you.
We partner with a third party to either display advertising on our website or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partner may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on this website and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests.

You may also opt-out of any communication by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by emailing us at jobseeker@higheredjobs.com. In order to keep information fresh and pertinent, your account on the restricted site (My Account) will be deleted after six (6) months of non-use. In addition, our website provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us. Users may change this information any time and as often as necessary. HigherEdJobs.com does reserve the right to send a one-time registration confirmation e-mail, and infrequent service messages to its customers to inform them of specific changes to HigherEdJobs.com's services or special alerts, regardless of email contact opt-in status. Examples of such a special alert message, to the email address you supplied, would be notification of the impending closing of an account that is believed to be abandoned or the addition of important new features to an existing service.
Job Posters may update their account information and manage their job postings by logging into their account through the Post a Job section of our website.
SECURITY MEASURES ARE IN PLACE
This website has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information contained on our website. During the subscription or registration process, you will have the option to provide a password for your account. We authenticate your access to our website through your use of your user ID and password, and protect your information with firewall protections. Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary. Particularly sensitive information, such as a college or university's credit card number collected for a commerce transaction, is encrypted prior to transmission using a Blowfish Encryption Algorithm and purged upon receipt. See www.schneier.com/blowfish.html for more information on the protections provided by this encryption. Please be advised that you are ultimately responsible for the security of your HigherEdJobs.com user ID and password. Please take care to store your HigherEdJobs.com user ID separately from your account password, or better yet, choose a password that you do not need to write down at all.
The security of your personally identifiable information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our website, you can contact us at privacy@higheredjobs.com.
CHILDREN
We do not specifically collect information about children, nor do we authorize use of this website by children.
CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email prior to the change becoming effective. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if users have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personally identifiable information be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our website notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post a notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.
If, at any time, you have questions or concerns about HigherEdJobs.com's Privacy Policy, please feel free to email us at privacy@higheredjobs.com.
THANK YOU FOR USING HIGHEREDJOBS.COM.
