IV. How HiSilicon Protects Your Personal Data
HiSilicon takes the security of your personal data seriously and has adopted standard industry practices to protect your personal data and prevent it from unauthorized access, disclosure, use, modification, damage, or loss. To protect your personal data, HiSilicon takes the following measures:
(1) We take reasonable measures to ensure that all personal data we collect is minimal and relevant to the purposes for which they are processed. We retain your personal data for no longer than is necessary for the purposes stated in this Statement, unless another retention period is required or permitted by law.
(2) We use a range of technologies such as cryptography to ensure data confidentiality during transmission. We implement trusted protection mechanisms to protect data and its storage servers from attack.
(3) We deploy access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized personnel can access your personal data. In addition, we control the number of authorized personnel and implement hierarchical permission management based on service requirements and personnel levels. Each access to personal data is logged, and logs are regularly reviewed by the administrator.
(4) We strictly select business partners and service providers and incorporate personal data protection requirements into commercial contracts, audits, and appraisals.
(5) We hold security and privacy protection training courses, tests, and publicity activities to raise employees' awareness. HiSilicon is committed to protecting your personal data. Nevertheless, no security measure is perfect and no product, service, website, data transfer, computing system, or network connection is absolutely secure.
To cope with possible risks, such as personal data leakage, damage, and loss, HiSilicon has developed several mechanisms and measures, clearly defined the rating standards of security incidents and vulnerabilities and corresponding procedures, and established a dedicated Security Advisory and Security Notice page. HiSilicon has established a dedicated emergency response team to implement security planning, loss reduction, analysis, locating, and remediation. The team also performs tracking operations with related departments based on security incident handling regulations and requirements.
If any personal data incident occurs, HiSilicon will notify you, pursuant to relevant legal and regulatory requirements, of the basics of the security incident and its possible impacts. Moreover, we will explain measures that HiSilicon has taken or will take, suggestions about active defense and risk mitigation, and remedial measures. The notification may be by email, text message, push notification, etc. If it is difficult to notify data subjects one by one, we will appropriately release a security notice. In addition, we will also report the handling status of personal data security incidents as required by supervisory authorities.
V.How You Can Manage Your Personal Data
A. Access, rectification, deletion, portability, restriction of processing, and objection to processing.
Legislation in some countries and regions in which HiSilicon provides products or services, or from where HiSilicon processes personal data, gives data subjects the rights to access, correct, delete, or port their personal data, or submit requests of restricting or objecting to the processing of their data.
1. Requesting modes and channels
Data subjects' requests must be submitted through HiSilicon designated privacy channels. Requests are valid regardless of whether the requester specifies the laws on which the requests are based. Data subjects can send requests to support@hisilicon.com
2. Validity of requests
Most laws require that data subjects comply with specific requirements when initiating requests. This Statement requires data subjects to:
(1) Send requests through the HiSilicon dedicated request submission channel (support@hisilicon.com).
(2) Provide sufficient information for HiSilicon to verify their identity (to ensure the person who initiates the requests is the corresponding data subject or is authorized by them).
(3) Ensure that their requests are specific and feasible.
Under some circumstances, provided by laws and regulations, HiSilicon does not have to comply with the request in full or at all.
(4) Consent withdrawal. You can change the authorized personal data collection scope or withdraw your consent without affecting the lawfulness of the processing activities based on the consent granted prior to such withdraw.
B. Deregistering a HiSilicon account
You can deregister your account in HiSilicon account-related products. After you deregister your account, we will stop providing you with products and services, and delete your personal data unless otherwise stipulated by law. Your account cannot be restored after deregistration. To start using HiSilicon products or services again, you need to register for a new account.
VI. How HiSilicon Protects Children's Personal Data
HiSilicon's personal and home products are intended for adults. However, when children use HiSilicon products or services, we take extra preventive measures to protect their privacy and security. HiSilicon identifies whether data subjects are children based on the age of majority defined by local laws.
When a child's personal data is collected after obtaining the consent of their parent or guardian, we will only use or disclose the information as permitted by law, as explicitly consented to by the child's parent or guardian, or as required to protect the child. If we find that personal information of children was collected without appropriate consent, we will try to delete the relevant content immediately. Parents or guardians who need to access, modify, or delete a child's personal data can contact us via the channels provided in section "How HiSilicon Protects Your Personal Data."
VII. Links to Third-Party Websites, Products, and Services
Products and services on HiSilicon websites may contain links to third-party websites, products, and services. All such links are provided for users' convenience only. HiSilicon has no control over such third parties and does not provide any explicit or implicit warranties for linked content. Such links do not constitute HiSilicon's recommendation or authorization of linked content. HiSilicon cannot control the privacy or data protection policies of third parties, and such parties are not subject to this Statement.
You must independently determine your interaction, if any, with such links. Before submitting your personal data to third parties, please read their privacy policies. HiSilicon takes no responsibility for the outcome of any interaction with third parties.
VIII. International Transfers of Your Personal Data
As a global company, your personal data collected by HiSilicon may be processed or accessed in the country/region where you use our products and services or in other countries/regions where HiSilicon or its service providers or business partners have a presence. These jurisdictions may have different or even no data protection laws.

For users in Mainland China, your personal data is stored on servers in Mainland China.
