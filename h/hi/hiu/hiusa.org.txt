Hostelling International USA Privacy Policy | HI USA
This document outlines Hostelling International USA's (HI-USA) online privacy policy, which governs personal information gathered on the national web site www.hiusa.org and its aliases.
HI USA Commitment to Online Security
Physical, electronic and managerial procedures have been employed to safeguard the security and integrity of personal information. Billing information is encrypted whenever transmitted or received online. Personal information is accessible only by staff or volunteers designated to handle online enquiries, purchases or complaints. All HI USA agents and contractors with access to personal information obtained on the HI USA web site are also bound to adhere to this policy.
Personal Information that HI USA May Collect Online
When an individual makes a purchase or places a reservation with HI USA online, HI USA may collect the following types of personal information: name, age, postal and e-mail addresses, telephone numbers, facsimile numbers and billing information. HI USA may also collect other demographic or psychographic information through member surveys and program participation with their consent.
How HI USA Uses Personal Information Collected Online
Unless you consent, we will not use your personal information for any purpose other than that for which it is submitted. We use personal information to reply to enquiries, complete a transaction, manage complaints, provide operational notices and in program recordkeeping. HI USA membership entitles the purchaser to certain benefits, including access to hostels, discounts and communications from HI USA and its local affiliates. HI USA is a tax-exempt, not for profit organization that relies on individual contributions to fund operations and directly solicits its membership for this purpose. HI USA will provide its members with the opportunity to opt out of receiving various membership benefits, communications and solicitations. Election boxes appear as part of individual communications and solicitations. At any time you can add or remove your name from an HI USA list by contacting us at webmaster@hiusa.org.
How Your Information May Be Shared
In order to process an enquiry, transaction or complaint, HI USA may send information to the International Youth Hostel Federation (IYHF), a National association affiliate, a hostel or other a relevant third party service or program supplier. HI USA will not sell or rent your personal information to any third party. HI-USA will not give direct access to any third party for the distribution of information or a given product or service offer, without being coordinated through HI USA.
HI USA may also release personal information to appropriate governmental authorities under the following circumstances:
Where release is required by law (for example, a subpoena) or regulation, or is requested by a government agency conducting investigations or proceedings;
Where our records indicate a member or participant may be engaged in fraudulent activity or other deceptive practices that a governmental agency should be made aware of.
Where your communication suggests possible harm to others.
