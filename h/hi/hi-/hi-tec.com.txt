The protection of your privacy is important to Hi-Tec. This statement discloses information practices of Hi-Tec, including what type of data we may collect and hold, how it is used and with whom the data is shared.

This Privacy Statement is applicable to data collected by Hi-Tec and other Hi-Tec associated companies in Europe that distribute Hi-Tec's products. In order to help you understand how we will use the data you provide, the following guidelines have been created.
In general, it is possible to access our sites without supplying any personal data. But in the cases where personal information is collected it is used primarily to best provide the services you might request and secondly to improve how Hi-Tec might serve you, by making appropriate use of the information. Further, we may also use this information to send you from time to time information about Hi-Tec products and services that we think may be of interest to you. Unless required to do so by law and as set out in this policy, we will not share, sell or distribute any of the information you provide to us without your consent.

The data may be transferred, stored and processed inside or outside the European Union and anywhere in the world but will not be disclosed to anyone outside the Hi-Tec Group, its associated companies or other companies who provide services of assistance to Hi-Tec's customers. We employ security measures to protect your information from access by unauthorised persons and against unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction and damage. We will retain your information for a reasonable period or as long as the law requires.
This information will be treated in accordance with the Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament in accordance with national laws passed pursuant to the Directive.
