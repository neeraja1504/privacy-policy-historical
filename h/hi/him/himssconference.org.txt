Collected Information
The information we collect is gathered from several sources. These include, but are not limited to: our membership, conferences, webinars, distance learning, publications, and newsletter and magazine subscriptions. From these sources we may collect postal addresses, e-mail addresses, telephone numbers, and/or demographic information for those individuals that volunteer such information. For each visitor to our websites, our web server automatically collects the visitor’s domain name and IP address only, but no other identifiable information unless volunteered. In addition, we collect aggregate information on which web pages visitors access or visit.
How We Use Collected Information
As part of a membership, purchase, subscription or registration agreement, members and registrants will be contacted by us through mail, e-mail, and/or phone to communicate with them about their subscription and/or registration. They will be contacted for renewal, surveys, updates concerning their account profile and special offers related to their subscription and/or registration. We also use the information to contact them for marketing purposes. Certain information — such as your password and credit card number — is never disclosed in any form to any outside party.
We may share information in the following ways:
When you provide contact and demographic information to HIMSS, we may share this within HIMSS related organizations (i.e.,: HIMSS Analytics, Government Health IT, HIMSS Foundation and the Institute for e-Health Policy).
We share aggregate demographic information and statistics with advertisers and other interested parties.
For events, we share contact and demographic information with exhibitors, corporate supporters and sponsors. In some cases, a registrant can opt-out from receiving communications from these third party vendors.
Cookies
We use cookies to store visitors’ preferences, record session information (such as items that visitors add to their shopping carts), record user-specific information such as what pages users access or visit, and customize web page content based on a visitor’s browser type or other information that the visitor sends.
Ad Servers
To best present offers that may be of interest to you, we have relationships with other carefully selected companies that we allow to place ads on our web pages. As a result of your visit to our sites, ad server companies may collect information such as your domain type, your IP address, and clickstream information. The use of such information is governed by the privacy policy of these other companies.
Security
HIMSS takes every precaution to protect your information from unauthorized use. When you submit sensitive information via our websites, the information is protected both online and offline. When our registration/subscription form asks for a credit card number or other sensitive information, that information is encrypted and protected with the best encryption software in the industry — SSL.
Policy Updates
From time to time, we may use provided information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy policy. If our information practices change we will immediately post any adjustments to our policy on this website. This will serve as your notification of these changes.
